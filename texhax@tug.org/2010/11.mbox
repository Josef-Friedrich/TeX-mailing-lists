Hi

I have?some figures which were generated in Matlab and?it has six?diffrent 
curves. I want to create legends?in Latex. I can do that in MatLab, but then the 
legends?become so big that it covers the whole graph. So I am wondering, if 
there is any way to create legends in latex and put it under the figure.? Any 
help would be appreciable. 


Thanks and?have a nice day.

Have a look at the overpic package, and use pict2e for more control over
drawing lines and things.

\usepackage{overpic}
\usepackage{pict2e}

See appended tested document. Alternatively, just put the legend-drawing
bits in a picture environment and, for example, put the figure in one
row of a tabular environment and the picture in the next row. I'd prefer
overpic because you can place the legend anywhere, including inside your
plot.

I have never seen how a MatLab figure gets into a LaTeX document, but I guess MatLab creates some graphic files (e.g,. EPS format) matlab-1, ..., matlab-6, that you include by \includegraphi... from the graphics bundle. The most common way for placement is wrapping the \include with a `figure' environment -- 

    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphi...{matlab-...}
        \caption{LEGEND}
    \end{figure}

-- and there you should have your LEGEND. Cf. any LaTeX documentation. Some package could refine this. 

Hoping to help -- Uwe.

Hi,
the easiest way to plot curves is to use the pgfplots package.  You
can instruct Matlab to write the data to an ASCII file.  pgfplots can
read such files.  

You can tell pgfplots where to put the legend, and much more.
Please look at the pgfplots manual for examples.

Regards,
  Reinhard

  Hi, everyone. I'm about to launch into a project using LaTeX to

individual Word files. If they were plain text, it would be fairly easy 
to batch-process them and make a LaTeX file. Since I have several 
hundred little files, opening them with Word and "saving as" would be a

If you can do the conversion in linux you have the programs antiword and 
catdoc. I have used them both to convert doc-files to txt and you can 
easily write a script to automate the process.. They will not work with 
docx though.

When one uses the shortenumerate package the vertical spacing between

is reduced from that of the enumerate package.  Is there a way to get
LaTeX to use a larger vertical spacing, say that used by the enumerate
package?  The documentation for the package does not mention this issue,
nor does it mention the fact that vertical spacing is reduced.

What I do, and I often have to do it, is make a new Word file, INSERT the small files into the new file 
save the new file and reopen it in wordpad, notepad, or something similar. (Also good for getting 
the HTML cruft out of web pages. 

Actually, this is all done in Open Office, on a Fedora 10 system, but it seems also to work in 
MS whatever. 

Even better is to take the content.xml part of an odt file and run it through an XSL filter, but there is a long 
learning curve to that, and I haven't really completed it yet

Subject: [texhax] Some questions about integrating TeX in workflow
Message-ID: <4CCF4A1F.8060405@pfdstudio.com>

I'm sorry for cross-posting, but I'm not sure which of these lists is 
more appropropriate.  I've asked some related questions last week, and 
based on the responses and my own tests, it looks like I will be able to 
use TeX for what I have in mind.  I'm very grateful for all the feedback 
and suggestions I've gotten.  Thank you!

Basically, we have a workflow that collects information from a database 
and produces reports.  I'd like to improve the typographic quality of 
those reports, and I think TeX is a good way to do it.  I can handle 
harvesting the information, putting it in TeX markup format, etc.  Some 
of the remaining questions are:

1) The TeX daemon the Jonathan Fine wrote about 
<http://www.pytex.org/doc/euro2002.pdf> seems like a great approach for 
repeated calls to TeX.  Has anyone worked with this recently?  Does this 
work with current TeX distributions?

2) I want to package up this software for remote installation, including 
the TeX portion.  I know I'll need some subset of the TeX Directory 
Structure, but I'd like to minimize the number of files.  Any documents 
or suggestions about how to do that?  (I know I'm being vague about what 
I need here, because I don't know yet.  I think I'd like to figure out 
what is an absolute minimal working TeX installation, and then add 
packages, fonts, etc. as needed.)

3) Are there licensing restrictions I need to be aware of, if I just 
re-distribute the software as is, along with my software that invokes it 
and performs other functions?

Thank you!

I don't have a copy of this package installed, but I did take a quick
look through
http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/shortlst/shortlst.dtx.
Shortenumerate seems to built on top of a standard \list environment.

Have you tried changing \parskip or \itemsep within shortenumerate?
Something like

   \begin{shortenumerate}\parskip=10ex
      % ...
   \end{shortenumerate}

10ex is probably more space than you want, but it shouldn't be hard
find a suitable value.

Fernando,

Aside from writing a script, and assuming you are using Windows, have  
you looked at this?

http://sourceforge.net/projects/wordtolatex/

Don't know if it will batch process but I can see no reason why it  
can't be scripted. I have not tried it.

Perhaps this might help.

Take look on psfrag package. Note, that this package only works with
latex+dvips.

If you don't like that approach you should give more information about images
(they type/format: eps or pdf, used engine: latex, pdflatex, xelatex,
lualatex).

Hi Mostafa,
first to clarify since some people before me might got it wrong already,
or I got it wrong.

If you talk about legend you are talking about a plot legend like
red line --- parameter 1
green line === parameter 2
blue line xxx parameter 3
etc.

or do you mean the figure caption like

Fig 1. This is a very nice figure which shows a blue, green, red and
black line.

For the second one you should follow the description of Uwe Lueck and in
my opinion this is the only correct way. Figure captions are part of the
document. They need to be formatted in a uniform standardized way
according to the layout and formatting rules of the manuscript. This
could only be provided by the document processor (e.g., LaTeX), since
the graphic program (e.g.,Matlab) has no idea how it has to look in the
final manuscript.

As for the first one... it is rather vice versa.
Please do not try to add a graph legend by LaTeX. Unlike you really know
what you are doing this would look almost always "wrong" since the
legend does not "fit" to the graph (e.g., different fonts, colour, size,
markers, etc.)

I guess what you want is to use Matlab to create your figures but you
need to make sure that the figures you produce have already the correct
size. You should not use rescaling options neither in LaTeX nor by any
other program. You need to save your figure directly with the final size
you are intended to place in your manuscript.
Only this way guarantees that all fonts have the same size.
Thus, if you need a figure of 5 x 7.5 cm for your manuscript you have to
create and save the figure in Matlab to be 5 x 7.5 cm. If you use a
raster format (jpg, png) you might need to tell Matlab to use a
resolution high enough for the printing process (e.g. 300 dpi).

Often people use much bigger figure sizes to display the image on the
monitor and become disappointed after saving them into a smaller size
figure. Since the fonts are not scaled accordingly, legends and axis
will be messed up.

If you create your figures in Matlab according to this rules from start,
you can directly see how they would look like in the final manuscript.

I didn't use Matlab for long time thus, I can't remember the necessary
commands. Please refer to the book "Mastering Matlab from Duane
Hanselman and Bruce Littlefield" which contains many many background
information which are not covered within the standard Matlab courses.

More rules which at least I follow for graph design:

1. Prefer black and white with good distinguishable plot markers or line
styles. Colour prints are still rare and xerox your paper would make it
unreadable.
2. In general use the same font you are using in the LaTeX document.
However, I prefer a sans-serif type which help to avoid problems with
grid-lines, punctuation, etc.
3. Use graph mark-up carefully, line width, markers, text, arrows, grid,
axes, etc. should not try to make your results more "beautiful". The
results are the important part. Choice simplicity over complexity. If
you have two lines in your plot, you can separated them by making one
solid and one dotted. I often see "funny" graphs which use different
markers, colours and line styles all together.

Hope that helps a bit

Torsten

Thanks to all for the help. I found a Windows version of antiword, and 
that worked well.

What about: 

    \begin{prop}\label{T:that-nasty}
    ... \tag{\thetheorem.1}... \tag{\thetheorem.2}...
    \end{prop}
    ... referring to equation~\ref{T:that-nasty}.1...

Subject: [texhax] changebar problem
Message-ID: <4cd2c7d4544af_75e2f4bb66c15d@winter26.tmail>

Hello,

It seems there are limits for LaTeX. I'm working on a book with listings (texttt, mathtt) with the listings package, normal text, math, a lot of big eps-pictures, marginnote and marginpar, and from time to time a whole paragraph with a changebar (bar outside, the side depends on the pagenumber). I know that this is a lot.
I used the changebar package. 

First - that time I did not see the cause - I had sometimes an empty page on the screen and the 
belonging text was missing. The effect: A certain page number was always not visible - let's assume page 35. I did put some empty pages at the front and got again page no. 35 not shown - but of course the (former) missing site
was shown (in fact) some pages later.  But now I have the impression that changebar is culpable. It's a thick volume (around 600 pages and I have the impression that LaTeX is overloaded.
BTW: I produce dvi-files and translate them with dvips. The making of the PDF is later done. 
But he translation to PDF (various ways) was never possible with the empty page included (and in the error message appeared a line with led me to suspect changebar). Translation to pdf was ok if the empty page wasn't included.

On page 223 I had a small paragraph with changebar (no pagebreak there), the changebar is done, but wrong (wrong site, 
wrong lower placing), so it comes out as an inclined line (see attachment). I tried a number of ways, deleted the aux-file and produced it again, but no way. 

Does anybody has an idea (by own experiences) how to get around the problem? 

I'm sorry that I cannot supply a short sample - it is just to many packages. 

With thanks in advance

hh

PS: in the attachment the changebar is on the wrong side - besides his other defects.

 comma before year
Message-ID: <993CCAD4A1E427468781DF67B7493A9608700E40@DB2PRD0103MB001.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

My school requires a variant of harvard style bibliography.

I used makebst to create a bibliography style that suits most of their requirements.

However, there is still one option which I cannot get to display.

My citations require a nomenclature written with <last name> comma <first name initials> COMMA date.

example:

Smith, J., 2001. The world crisis. Dumbsville: The University Press.

However, what I get is:

Smith, J. 2001. The world crisis. Dumbsville: The University Press.


makebst has an explicit option for this format (taken from the dbj file):

%>>REVERSED DATE (if including month)
%>>DATE FORMAT (if non author-year citations)
%<<DATE FORMAT (if author-year citations)
%   %: (def) Year plain without any brackets
% yr-par,%: Year in parentheses as (1993)
% yr-brk,%: Year in brackets as [1993]
% yr-col,%: Year preceded by colon as `: 1993'
% yr-per,%: Year preceded by period as `. 1993'
  yr-com,%: Date preceded by comma as `, 1993'
% yr-blk,%: Year preceded by space only, as ` 1993'

However, despite selecting the option "yr-com,%: Date preceded by comma as `, 1993'"
the compiled bst file refuses to display the bibliographical citation in this format.

How can I get the comma to display?

Zip file with minimal example enclosed.

Please feel free to crosspost this message to the bibtex list if appropriate.

This is due to a bug in hyperref, which was identified and fixed some

Subject: [texhax] bizarre tikz behavior with recent texlive 2010 updates
Message-ID: <20101106221029.GA21807@jdiamond-nb2>

OK, I admit I'm not 100% sure this is the optimal place to report
this, but here goes anyway.

I did
	tlmgr update --all
the other day, and after that finished Bad Things started happening.

Boiling it down, here is a minimal non-working example (plain pdftex,
NOT pdflatex):

%------------------------------------
\input tikz

\hrule
\vfill
just a plain line of text in the middle of the page
\vfill
\eject

\end
%------------------------------------

The line claims it is in the middle of the page, but if I \input tikz
it is not.  If I don't \input tikz, the line is (more or less) in the
middle of the page, as expected.  Also, when I \input tikz, my page
number goes away.


I have a texlive 2010-beta lying around, and I get the expected
behaviour if I use that.

I suppose it is possible that a neutrino clobbered some bit on my
disk.  Before I reload all of tl2010 from scratch, could someone let
me know if they see the same behaviour?

Thanks.
				Jim

Message-ID: <AANLkTikTti77aZ43jRUgco80UN_Rg9Apy3v2DMZSCxd9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi There,

I have been able to use the column command in Beamer to present a diagram on
one side and a step by step analysis to the side of it.

\documentclass[11pt]{beamer}

However, when I switch to beamerarticle mode to produce a set of notes to
hand to students:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{beamerarticle}

I get all kinds of strange behavior where the columns are no longer
recognized, alignment is gone and the output even overwrites one column on
the other.  I tried inserting a landscape option thinking it might be a
spacing issue with no effect:

\documentclass[11pt,landscape]{article}
\usepackage{beamerarticle}

It still seems to present the columns in succession, vertically, as a best
case result.  Worst case it overwrites one column's information with the
other's.

Can anyone suggest what I might be doing wrong or how I might fix this?
 Thanks in advance.

Tom

Hello Jim,

I've just tested your example with and without /input tikz as you
mentioned and got exactly the same results:
text line at top and no page number.

I confirm this bizarre  behavior. 

Normally I didn't use plain TeX, so I can't say more.

My last TL1020 update was done from CTAN last friday.

Hello,

We are organizing National workshop on LaTeX and PSTricks at Pune, India
between 22-26th Nov.
(http://fossme.bprim.org/workshop-latex)

For that we downloaded DVD of TEX Live 2010. We will burn the DVDs and
distribute to participants.

Is there any DVD cover Design , picture available. I remember I saw one for
earlier TeX Live DVDs.

If not, we are planning to design it. Will it be useful for Tuggies?

If you have some comments for that pleas let me know. We can keep it
download able.

Our workshop is supported by Govt. of India.
through Ministry of Human Resource Management(MHRD) under the project
on Use of Open source software for Teaching Maths.

Subject: [texhax] how to export latex to pdf that allows commenting
Message-ID: <AANLkTin0bdEHwf7PR7sTt5iRu0gXHZwnFgozknNW7Xtf@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Victor,



you don't know me. I checked an old thread on how to add comments to pdf
documents generated with latex located in here _http://_
www.tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2008-August/007802.html (please remove two
underscores from the link, trying to avoid this mail to end in you spam
folder). I was also looking for a way to add comments to PDF documents
generated by latex because I need to make annotations on my thesis. After a
few failed attempts using acrobat I tried on Foxit Reader. Foxit reader is a
free reasonable good pdf reader that requires much less resources that
acrobat, works very well on slow PCs. Anyway, I was able to insert comments
on the PDF and save it using Foxit. Saved comments are visible in both Foxit
Reader and Acrobat Reader (locked for edition in acrobat, but visible).

I don't really know who are you, but I think that, since someone asked you
about how to add comments, you may inform/publish this methodology so it is
available to more people.

Foxit Reader is available over here _http:_//
www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/reader/ (same as above, remove underscores).

Best Regards!

Antonio Luna

It looks like you are trying to use latin input - and it is a bad idea. I use


\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{cmap}
\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

and then type Russian letters (and Latin) without any switch. One can
use different options in inputenc but should set editor to the same
encoding

Subject: [texhax] Is there a ConTeXt list?
Message-ID: <AANLkTik4yyTPWu9XQ-sxO_t_x8W-A6Yhk+jsWtYktMCS@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a ConTeXt list?  I've used LaTeX for years, but I'm trying to work
with ConTeXt now on a Win7 PC that has already had MikTeX 2.9 installed.
I've downloaded the minimal ZIP file, unpacked it and run the
first_setup.bat file.

Then I opened TeXworks, created a ConTeXt typesetting option, entered a
helloworld.tex program, and tried to ConTeXt it.

However, I just get these messages:

MTXrun | forcing cache reload

MTXrun | resolvers: skipping configuration file
'C:/Users/peterd/AppData/Roaming/MiKTeX/2.9/web2c/texmfcnf.lua' (no file)

MTXrun | resolvers

MTXrun | resolvers

MTXrun | the resolver databases are not present or outdated

MTXrun | resolvers: remembering file 'mtx-context.lua'

MTXrun | resolvers: using suffix based filetype 'lua'

MTXrun | unknown script 'context.lua' or 'mtx-context.lua'


Any clues available?

Thanks!

Thank, Herbert.  However, I don't seem to have a TEXMFHOME environment
variable set.  The only TeX-related variable I see is TEXMFOS, and that's
already pointing to a ConTeXt directory.

I do have access to the ntg-context list now, so I'll try there.

Thank you!

The two tools in this problem space I'm aware of are:

LyX: http://www.lyx.org

and

TeXmacs: http://www.texmacs.org/

They go about the problem in different ways --- LyX's is particularly innovative and IMO the most forward-looking.

There're also TeXWord, Scientific Author, Scientific Workplace and arguably Publicon (though apparently it's being merged into Mathematica?) for commercial tools.

Also, some equation editors for Word exist which will export into (La)TeX format.

if I remember correctly, the original poster of the question cannot check
how things look like in those WYSIWYG systems because he is blind. So I

Yes, both LyX and TeXmacs afford one the option of directly typing (La)TeX code and then having it converted on-screen into a formatted example (which retains the ability to be further edited).

For example, in LyX one would invoke a menu command which would insert a math equation construct (Insert | Math | Inline(or Numbered or Display) Formula) and one could then begin typing. Typing a ``^'' would create a superscript and place the cursor in said superscript box.

Typing \frac inserts a fraction construct and places the cursor in the numerator field.

> for example, say, I wanted to typeset a fraction such as `\frac{x}{y^2}', would I be able to *see* the result of my code immediately, that is to say, without having to run the LaTeX compiler separately?

Yes. LyX and TeXmacs also make it possible to interactively create equations using palettes of buttons which can then be converted into the textual representation which can then be edited.

Was this what you wished to know?

TeXmacs is something of its own, it doesn't build on TeX, 
it only uses "TeX fonts" while I haven't investigated 
what this means, e.g., as a limitation. 

Jonathan Fine worked on TeX daemons,
as has been mentioned in different threads recently, 
which means that the compiler runs without asking for.  
But what you see immediately is not in the "edit window". 

Similarly, restricted to things like formulae: 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/preview

I don't know which alternatives are currently developed most actively. 

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Though I don't know the cause of this 'strange behavior' but is you
change you definition of '\E' then you get always 'lower' variant. Cp.

\newcommand\E{\mathop{\mathbf{E}}}

IMHO this variant is more LaTeXish so either this behavior is correct or
only the first one (in your example) is correct.

(side note: I thing you miss '\' in second example in  front of E).

Use \mathbf{E} instead of the LaTeX 2.09 \bf, and all is consistent.

The old-style font commands introduce spurious {} for the first
instance at a particular size, so your E is not a single char.

That is bug "latex/3357 (2001-08-04): font commands give {} in math mode"
that was never fixed (even though I submitted a patch with the report).

Hi Paul,
I suppose that screen readers can gather the text only if font
rendering is done by operating system facilities which provide a hook
for them.

If a program is using its own font rendering library, I suppose that
there is no such hook, i.e. the text is only visible to the program
itself, which then creates bitmaps of the glyphs in order to display
them on screen.

I fear that most free programs are using free libraries like freetype
but screen readers on Windows hook into libraries provided by Microsoft.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I must admit Windows programming isn't something I'm very familiar with.
Is this a necessary part of designing a LaTeX editor?

You could use my little atchange program to automate a script to do
whatever you want to do:

http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/atchange.html

I currently set up an atchange to watch my LaTeX source (.tex file)
and when the source changes it runs my 'l' script.  The pdf results
are sent to another script, pdfshow, which displays the pdf using skim
(or sends the file to me at home for display).  The skim pdf reader
automatically updates when the file changes.

The result:  In one window I edit my LaTeX file.  I write the file out
(programmed in vim to be a comma, ',').  In another window next to
that I get the results without touching the mouse.  It's flexible and
fast, nearly ideal.

So, since you are blind, you could set up a script that is triggered
by an altered LaTeX file and does whatever you need to do to get the
result so you can sense it.

If there is an error, my latest version of 'l' (not yet available)
even cuts out the relevant part of the log file and shows me that as a
pdf using skim.  It's cute because all I see are two windows on my
screen: the vim editing window and the typeset LaTeX output.  I
usually put the other window which shows the process of typesetting
behind the LaTeX window so I never see it (or I let it peak out a bit
so I can see that it is running).  When there is an error the error
window pops to the front.  It even says out loud to me that there is
an error!  Without moving my fingers from the keyboard, I correct the
error, hit a comma and the now-correct LaTeX window comes to the front
showing the corrected text.

(This is on a Mac OS X and uses a script called 'focus' that activates
the Terminal after completing so I never need to take my fingers off
the keyboard.)

... or better, the argument is *centered*, if it produces (contains) 
a single glyph, according to rule 13 of TeXbook Appendix G. Try

    x $\mathop{E}$ x $\mathop{e}$ x

-- the `E' is lowered, the `e' is raised (at least with me).

By contrast, if there is something more in \mathop{...} besides a symbol, 
the symbol is placed like text, its baseline just on the surrounding 
baseline. That's why "max" and "sin" within \mathop{...} are not centered, 
but typeset as text, baseline on baseline, as we expect it.

I.e. (for "laymen" as I was one a few minutes ago): 
because the first appearance of \mathop{\bf E} adds some `{}' to the `E', 
it is *not* centered. It is centered the next times. Enjoy

    x $\mathop{e} \mathop{E}$

Hi Paul,

as to screen readers showing TeX's output of, e.g., 
from $\frac{x}{y^2}$: what do you expect? I have typeset it, 
the outcome is a bar with an `x' above and an `y' with 
superscript `2' below. What should a screen reader tell about it?
I have copied it from Adobe Reader 8 under Linux (Fedora 8, 
Linpus Lite) into a .txt file that reads

    x
    y2

(one line contains an `x', the next line contains 2', 
 no indication of the bar and the position of the `2'). 
What could a screen reader do instead? 

In this special case, a good text representation could be 
x/(y^2), but that is very different what LaTeX does, 
rather reminding of what you could type on a scientific calculator.

Well, this seems to go into the MathML direction I don't know much about, cf. 

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GELLMU 

A math formula really has a graphic character (as soon it 
gets some complexity), and one approach for displaying 
formulas on the web indeed is presenting them as graphic 
images (e.g., PNG). There is a different approach: constructing 
formulas in pure HTML, Wikipedia tries this some way; 
some commercial program goes much farther this way. 
But then still I wonder what a screen reader should tell 
about the sizes, shapes, and positions of the glyphs. 

A fraction may contain other fractions in its denominator, 
and with TeX you can choose whether the contained 
fractions are typeset in text or in script size -- what should 
the screen reader tell about sizes, how?

In another thread we learnt that due to a bug, certain 
symbols in certain math formulas are not placed at the 
vertical position where they should be. Should a screen 
reader be able to tell this?

I have wondered if there could be a device that represents 
pixels by needles that are pushed out of a surface for 
representing black ink, so you could feel the shape 
of glyphs and formulas with your fingers.  

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Thanks to Donald Arsenau for actually explaining this.  But on the basis 
of what he said, I would expect
  \def\E{\mathop{\bf {E}}}
to work.  However,
  \def\E{\mathop{\bf E\kern0pt}}
works perfectly.

If you actually want this (somewhere I read a rather unconvincing 
explanation why Knuth did), then \setbox0=\hbox{$\E$} ought to get around 
the bug.

I forgot to add that vertical centering of a single \mathop glyph may have been a *surprise* and not wanted at all. 

Contrary to the recommendation \mathop{\mathbf E} from others before, \mathop{\textbf E} positions the `E' just as \max or \sin "baseline on baseline", and this may have been intended.

Interestingly, I asked that same question of Thomas Rokicki (author of dvips and NeXTstep's TeXView.app) at the recent TUG conference in San Francisco.

The bottom line is that Sir Tim Berners-Lee chose TextEdit.app's RTFview as the basis for his worldwideweb.app and that computers of that day simply couldn't swing the processing and storage requirements of composing TeX source on-the-fly (this was back when my NeXT Cube, a 25 MHz 68030 was considered a high-end workstation and a complex page might take tens of seconds to render and there were no free Type 1 math fonts at the time --- the donation of the CM and AMS fonts by Blue Sky and Y&Y was almost a decade in the future).

Fortunately now we have MathML, the Stix Fonts, and various tools which allow one to work towards nicely displaying equations on the web.

Unfortunately, that's a consequence of the programming GUI toolkit being used. A quick check of the Bug Tracker doesn't show this as a reported problem.

I've often wished that the toolkit-independent nature of LyX had been preserved and expanded upon w/ natively-interfaced versions of it being available for Mac OS X and Windows.

I've subscribed to the LyX-devel list again and have sent this message to that list where hopefully it will spark some discussion.

I think it was about more than just performance.  A goal of HTML (as 
with SGML) was to separate "content" from "presentation."  (I used 
quotes because every graphic designer knows that presentation *IS* 
content, but that's another argument.)  Both SGML and HTML tried to use 
mark-up to delineate the structure of a document, while allowing the 
presentation to be determined by the destination device and user.  
(audio vs. text, etc.)  Of course, HTML allowed quite a few impurities 
in the form of presentation elements like <i> and <b>, but that's 
another story.

LaTeX is more about document structure than plain TeX, but it's still 
basically a programming language for formatting print documents, not 
re-purpose-able content.

It's also true that the reason we have JavaScript and Flash and whatnot 
is that this mythical separation of content and presentation is just 
that ... mythical.  The fact is that publishers want to control the way 
their content is presented.

AIUI, one has to use native window-creation calls and tools so that the underlying system knows that the window exists, under what title, what regions it has and in what order things should be read out, what aspects of it are button controls which need to be interactive, &c..

Windows 7 comes w/ a basic screen reader called ``Narrator'':

So any developer w/ access to Windows 7 should be able to test this.

A search for ``QT windows screen reader'' has a _lot_ of hits, so this is a known problem. Arguably it would be best addressed at the QT-level --- that way all programs using QT would inherit the fix.

Ah, Q~T, is it? Well, I understand there's been some activity in the 
open source community to address the issues therein though so far I 
haven't heard of any major breakthroughs.
btw, Narrator is also available on XP.

On Windows systems there is LaTeXdaemon that does something very similar

The bug occurs with the loading of the font, for the first use.  Since 
rm fonts are pre-loaded (they are one of the main three math families)
the \rm command is immune.  

The patch, which I eventually stuck in sansmath.sty, is

\def \@fontswitch #1#2{%
  \ifmmode
     \let \math at bgroup \relax
     \def \math at egroup ##1{%
         \let \math at bgroup \@@math at bgroup
         \let \math at egroup \@@math at egroup
         ##1}%
     #2\relax
  \else
     #1%
  \fi
}

Subject: [texhax] Calculate remaining space after a page break and a
	\penalty of 10000
Message-ID: <20101110133718.2d58fa6f@mike.laurentum.de>

Hello List,

I'm writing on a package that places the lyrics of a song block wise on
a page, so that as little vertical space as possible is occupied. The
calculations are based on \pagetotal and \pagegoal (resp. \vsize, if
\pagegoal is not yet given).

This is working rather well, except for one thing. Page breaks are not
done using \eject, but are left up to TeX, by simply assuming, that the
whole page is unused and thus using enough vertical space, so that TeX
is ejecting the page, while respecting all \penaltys. This leaves the
problem, that the assumed free space may be incorrect, e.g. if the
lyrics block is following a section head.

Now, is there a way to tell TeX to remove the "\nobreak-content" from
main vertical list, put it back to the list of recent contributions and
do an eject? Or, if this is not possible, is there a way to calculate
the vertical size of the recently contributed boxes, that would be
taken to the next page?


Greetings,
  Wolfgang Lorenz


PS: I've had some difficulties finding the right words, to explain
    this problem. I hope what you understood is what I meant.

Hi Support,

My name is John Jacob and I am a current TUG member.

I usually receive a new TEX Live CD sometime in October.  Since I have recently purchased a new Mac OS X "Snow Leopard" computer, I do need the latest version of MacTeX 2010 to run on that new computer.  I also have trouble downloading files here at my college (PC based only) and bringing them back to my home where I cannot receive internet access (being too remote a location).

Will you be sending out a TEX Live CD this year?  If so, will MacTex 2010 be on that CD?

Thanks for your help,

John Jacob

Dear Sirs,

\documentclass[12pt]{article}   
\usepackege[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[brazil]{babel}

\begin{document}

\end{document}

than a run it with pdflatex. The pdf appear strange, with a code i?ve never seen before.....
I don?t know to solve this problem. How should i do ....
See the log and pdf files.......

It appears to be a font problem.


Thanks.

Since it is a DVD MacTeX is included on the DVD, so if you are a TUG 
member you will receive a DVD within a few weeks. I think they are just 
about done pressing the DVDs

MacTeX usually fits within a 2 Gb USB stick (which are quite cheap where 
I live).

start by spelling \usepackage correctly

then it might be an idea to specify the input encoding of your text

Saving in UTF8 and using

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[brazil]{babel}

\begin{document}
? muito importante a a??o padr?o c?u.
\end{document}

seems more appropriate to me.

You will need to adjust the input encoding to the encoding used by your 
editor of choice

Hello Wolfgang,

I think a minimal example showing what you want to do would be better, because I
for one really can't picture your problem. Using \pagetotal and \pagegoal to
compute available space is a good solution, assuming there is no vertical rubber
glue, but I can't see what's wrong. And actually I don't understand what "as
little vertical space" means, nor that "page breaks are left up to TeX", since
that's the default behavior.

Best,
Paul

Your input file uses UTF8 character encoding, which is a mismatch
for the T1 font encoding you specified.  T1 is *close to* the
latin-1 character encoding so it often works without translation
if your text files use latin-1 characters, and I presume your
latex files used to be latin-1.

For your new file you need to declare the input encoding with

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

And what do you want to test?
* argument starts with `t',
* after expansion the first token is `t',
* the argument contains `t',
* ...
The context is important, are assigments allowed or is the
test restricted to expandable contexts?
...

Variant without expansion:

\makeatletter
\newcommand{\test}[1]{%
  \expandafter\ifx\expandafter t\@car#1XX\@nil
    True%
  \fi
}
\makeatother

Yours sincerely

actually I want to have a group of tokens instead a single token.

To be more specific, this is what I have in mind:

\newcommand{\setmaindir}[1]{\if#1RTL\pagedir TRT\else \if#1LTR\pagedir
TLT\fi\fi}

so that

\setmaindir{RTL} gives  \pagedir TRT and
\setmaindir{LTR} gives \pagedir TLT

Obviously, 

    \newcommand{\test}[1]{True}

satisfies the specification (maybe the most elegant from the countable infinite set of solutions). 

Hope this helps in some, may be indirect, way, and somebody joins me laughting ... sorry, this is humiliating ...

Aha.

1. The TeXbook starts explaining conditional definitions on page 207. 

You seem to want to test if two token lists are the same. Usually, one uses \def and \ifx for this (not the full story).

I realize that if somone learns other programming languages before learning about TeX, it may be a surprise to learn that TeX's \if is a very special thing, it plays a very minor role as an analogue to "if" in other programming languages. 

2. For a programmer, reading some documentation of the programming language may be helpful.

A TeX macro programmer should IMHO read the TeXbook -- or something similar, I cannot properly compare ... but it is the only book I really can recommend for this purpose!

So I am somehow reviving that RTFM idea that has played some role in the past of this list ...

3. For a programmer, adopting some logical thinking may be helpful. It may be good to think of a somewhat formal specification, at least for a restricted set of input situations.

I know examples typically are the starting point, but one should then try at (partial) generalizations.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Please consult a dictionary, just as I did. Even googling may help, and you learn a lot by adding "wictionary" to the search string.

Could you please explain the the rest of us, Uwe, what
this has to do with TeX ?  It appears to be little more
than a personal attack on another list member who has
sought advice, and as such has no place on this list
(or most other places, for that matter).

I think you read that too darkly, Philip. I had the impression Uwe just had
a bit of fun with the results of Vafa's trying to explain his problem in a
foreign language, when explaining it in itself already is quite a
challenge. Uwe shared this fun with us -- and then even tried to stress
that it's just meant as a harmless bit of fun. I write 'tried to', as I am
not sure whether a non-German-native person would have read his brief
apology like that. Though Uwe's language might sound harsh at times, I am
very positive that is mainly due to the fact that he's writing in a foreign
language too, and far from his intention.

Just my thoughts,

	Susan

Well, perhaps so : but for one non-native speaker to make fun
of another non-native speaker's English seems to indicate a
rather strange sense of humour, and when the sentence in
question appears to be directly related to the second speaker's
sense of national identity ("I prefer the most bloodcurdling death
to living with humility. The only country I am faithful to, is IRAN.
Do not denigrate my last moments..."), then I for one find
Uwe's attempts at "humour" to be in singularly bad taste.

depends on which document class you are using and if it is only for 
visual effect or if a reference to this section should also give 1.

As it seems you were using UTF-8 for character encoding. Try using the
package inputenc with option utf8 in your document's head:

    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

Yes, I've thought so. ;-) Well, I'll try.

As I've written, I'm developing a package, that places the lyrics of a
song depending on the space, that's available on a page. In a bbLyrics
environment you first add verses (stanzas) to the current bbLyrics
environment using \bbVerse (see example). The verses are saved in
boxes. With the command \end{bbLyrics}, the magic begins:

  First TeX calculates the remaining vertical space on the current page
via \pagegoal - \pagetotal.
  Next it tries to assemble the lyrics boxes columnswise to fit the
remaining space. That means, it starts with putting all verses into one
column: (imagine, each number is a box)

   ------------ current position
     1.
     2.
     3.
     4.
   ------------ page end
     5.
     6.
     7.

  This may fail eventually, because the resulting box (the verses are
put in a \vbox which again is put in an \hbox, to cover multiple
columns, but these are mere details...) is too high. Now the number
of verses in the first column is reduced, until the resulting box fits
the remaining space of the current page:

   ------------ current position
     1.    5.
     2.    6.
     3.    7.
     4.
   ------------ page end

  Now the contents would fit the page, but it may be possible, that
some of the vertical space that is needed may be saved, so the number
of verses in the first column is further reduced until some verses
would be left out, since the width of the resulting box must be smaller
than \hsize:

   ------------ current position
    1.  3.  5.
    2.  4.  6.
     
     
   ------------ page end

Then, the last version, prior to losing verses is chosen:

   ------------ current position
    1.  4.  7.
    2.  5.
    3.  6.
    
   ------------ page end
  
  Right? This is how it works, if all verses are fitting. Now there may
be a case, that some verses must be put on the next page, or even on a
page beyond:

   ------------ current position
    1.  2.  3.
   ------------ page end/next page
      4.   6.
      5.   7.
     

   ------------ page end
   
  This is also working. Now here comes the problem. If there is not
enough space left, for putting even one verse on the current page AND
the last box in TeX's main vertical list is a section head I must not
simply \eject the current page, because that would break an unbreakable
\penalty. So I could simply assume, that the whole page is unused,
which would result in a box too high for the current page and TeX would
eject the page BEFORE the section head. This is working in most cases,
since most songs are not that long. But there may be cases (and I've
already had some) where the resulting lyrics box is using up the whole
space. Now TeX stands there with a section head to place and a box in
the main vertical list, which is (again) too high to be placed under
the section head.

   -------------- current position
    
   -------------- page end/next page
    section head
      1... 5...
      2... 6...
      3... 7...
   ---4...------- page end

  These cases I want to cover, but I'm at a loss. I have no idea how
to tell TeX to eject the current page, without breaking spaces that are
not to be broken. After such a page break \pagegoal - \pagetotal should
work again.
  And I also don't know how to get the height and depth of the recently
contributed content, or the items on TeX's main vertical list. I think,
this way I could calculate the available space correctly.

  
Now, here's a minimal example, that should only show how the current
version of the package is used:

    % example: song.tex
    \documentclass{book}
    \usepackage{bblyrics}   % <- the package I'm writing on
    
    \begin{document}
        
        % here may be random stuff...
        
        \section{Wenn alle Br?nnlein fliesen}
        \begin{bbLyrics}{Wenn alle Brunnlein fliesen}
            \bbVerse{1.}{%
                \hbox{Wenn alle Br?nnlein flie?en, so muss man trinken}
                \hbox{wenn ich mein Schatz nicht rufen darf, tu ich ihm winken,}
                \hbox{wenn ich mein Schatz nicht rufen darf,}
                \hbox{juja, rufen darf, tu ich ihm winken.}
            }
            \bbVerse{2.}{%
                \hbox{Ja winken mit dem ?ugelein und treten auf den Fu?.}
                \hbox{Sitzt eine in der Stube drin, die meine werden muss.}
            }
            \bbVerse{3.}{%
                \hbox{Warum sollt sie's nicht werden, ich hab sie ja so gern,}
                \hbox{sie hat zwei blaue ?ugelein, die leuchten wie zwei Stern.}
            }
            \bbVerse{4.}{%
                \hbox{Sie hat zwei rote W?ngelein, sind r?ter als der Wein,}
                \hbox{ein solches M?del findst du nicht wohl unterm Sonnenschein.}
            }
            \bbVerse{5.}{%
                \hbox{So herzig wie mein M?dele ist keines auf der Welt,}
                \hbox{vom Kopf bis zu den F??ele ist alles wohlbestellt.}
            }
        \end{bbLyrics}
    \end{document}
    % end of example

I hope the explanation made it all a little clearer. If it helps I also
could send you the current dtx-file. It's not properly documented,
though. AND: I'm sorry, but I'm not really into the TeX terminology
yet. That may make the explanations somewhat hard to read and

LaTeX has 

    \def\@seccntformat#1{\csname the#1\endcsname\quad}

and you could change it into 

    \def\@seccntformat#1{\csname the#1\endcsname.\quad}

-- so much for the section heading in main text, vs. TOC!?

Yes that works pretty well.  It leaves too much space after the period. 
This looks better:
\def\@seccntformat#1{\csname the#1\endcsname.\kern.5em}

While The TeXbook is indeed great, I would also recommend this reference:  

@Book{Eijkhout07:TeXbyTopic,
  author = 	 {Victor Eijkhout},
  title = 	 {{\TeX} by Topic},
  publisher = 	 {Lulu},
  year = 	 2007,
  note = 	 {\url{http://eijkhout.net/texbytopic/texbytopic.html}}}

By the way, the electronic copy of this book is free.  I use both the
printed (from Lulu) and electronic versions a lot.

Good luck

I don't have a good picture, and didn't do the meticulous 
review of the existing code, but I will take a stab anyway.

Until there is a possible breakpoint, \pagetotal may not
include the most recent contributions.  You have to give
a breakpoint, even \penalty9999, to get an accurate 
\pagetotal.

Since you are worried about being after section titles,
I recommend a heuristic:  

Record \pagetotal (call it \subtotal)
check \if at nobreak to see if breaks are forbidden
For no-break case, choose to introduce a \penalty9999
only if \subtotal is well short of a page, say .75\pagegoal
For the else case, always give \penalty9999
Finally, check the real pagetotal.

Depends on the document class:
- For the standard classes there is the "secdot" package
- KOMA-Script and Memoir support this out of the box

Thank you, I didn't know this...

> Since you are worried about being after section titles,

I am worried about any content that may occur, with a penalty of 10000.
The section titles were only meant as an example, because in the
document I am working on the lyrics may come directly after a section
change. But I'd like the package to behave more generally.

I've thought about leaving it up to the user to limit the space
bbLyrics is using for the "first page", but that would be a hack I'd
rather not implement. If all else fails, this will be the way I go,
though.

Thanks for your suggestions!

Ok. I kind of see what you mean. Now, the first problem is of course as
mentioned by Donald: after a section, or any \penalty10000, you don't have the
real \pagetotal, so you can't properly build the song. I can see two solutions:
solution one is LuaTeX. Solution two is: when using columns, don't make one big
box, but small ones instead, with penalties inbetween, as follows:

penalty
box: 1... 5...
penalty
box: 2... 6...
penalty
box: 3... 7...
penalty
box: 4...

and TeX will break (in your example) after "3... 7...".

Best,
Paul

I do not know Uwe, so making fun of someone who you do not know and have not
seen before is already stupid. If I ever wanted to make fun of him and his
national identity, there were heaps of things but who and what human virtues
allow me to mock him or anyone else. I am very proud to be an Iranian and I
see nothing that makes me ashamed of my national identity even if some fools
try to make fun of my national identity.

I think you misunderstood Uwe's humor completely. I cannot quote, as I
already deleted his mail from my system. But his joke had nothing to do at
all with Iran.

If I remember correctly, he sent you an answer that totally fulfilled your
requirements *as written* (\newcommand{\test}{true}), but which was of
course, as he knew very well, not what you were looking for. I guess it was
his first thought when reading the phrasing of your request, and having
seen that others already had sent you answers to your true question, he
just shared his mirth with us.

The only point where your signature and thus your devotion to Iran came
into play was the fact that his joke might be received as humiliating. So
he apologized (or, as I wrote before, tried to apologize, as he used a
word-by-word translation of a German apology, which in English might not be
as easily read as apology) in his mail already, trying to avoid exactly the
anger this thread now caused.

I do not know Uwe personally either. I just know his name from this mailing
list. And I *always* read his mails, because even if his English is not as
smooth as that of a native speaker, his TeX knowledge is amazing. I already
learned a lot from his posts, and as far as I can tell he frequently spends
significant amounts of time with elaborate and sound solutions to others'
problems. 

So please cool down. As far as I can tell, in this thread a completely
harmless thing exploded due to misunderstanding. As far as I can tell no
disrespect was intentioned.

Just my thoughs,

	Susan

Yes, I will have to address this one. But Donald's approach seems to

Sounds promising. So it means, that soon I will be trying to learn a

Unfortunately that wouldn't work, because the verse boxes may differ in
height (and depth) and most certainly differ in width. The width could
be addressed by inserting the right amount of glue between the boxes in
the rows, but boxes with different height would lead to unwanted
vertical spaces between the verses. Here is a sketch, of what I mean:

   -----------        -----------
     1.. 4..            1.. 4..
     ... 5..            ...    
     2.. ...     =>     2.. 5..
     3.. 6..                ...
     ...                3.. 6..
   -----------        --...------


Anyway, thanks for all your help. Now I can stop agonizing about if and
how it is possible to correctly measure the upcoming page's free space
or not, because -- as it seems -- it ain't. So I will leave it to the
user to limit the space for the "first page" if this should be
necessary. 

Cheers,
  Wolfgang

You can set parameters with keyval or xkeyval packages. Is there any package
that you can do the same with commands. So for example, you define a
command, say, \direction which has two values RTL and LTR and is used in the
following way:

\direction=RTL or

\direction=LTR

Is it possible to implement these kind of control sequences?

Not sensibly, because the RHS ("Right-hand side")
is not monadic as far as TeX is concerned.  The
nearest that TeX would easily allow for such assignments
are :

	\let \direction = \RTL (where \RTL must be pre=defined)

		or

	\direction = {RTL} (where \direction is a \toks variable)

Yes but i would recommend i method which fits to the macro package, e.g. \setdirection{LTR} or \setdirection[RTL]

\def\direction#1=#2#3
  {\def\currentdirection{#2#3}}

\tracingmacros1

\direction=LTR Direction: \currentdirection\par
\direction=RTL Direction: \currentdirection\par

\vskip\baselineskip

\direction =LTR Direction: \currentdirection\par
\direction =RTL Direction: \currentdirection\par

\vskip\baselineskip

\direction = LTR Direction: \currentdirection\par
\direction = RTL Direction: \currentdirection\par

11/10 for effort, Wolfgang, but there are some common cases
for which it does not work :

\direction = LTR\relax Direction: \currentdirection\par
\direction = RTL\relax Direction: \currentdirection\par

If the direction is always made of three letters, as I think it is, then

\def\direction=#1#2#3{...}

might work well. Of course it forbids

\direction={RTL}

Anyway, Vafa, are you trying to mimick TeX assignments or key-value's? In the
former case (which is investigated here), nothing will be perfect. In the
latter, though, the "key = value" pair is normally well delimited (e.g. by a
comma or the end of the list), so the value can be easily retrieved.

Best,
Paul

Yes, it is possible to define a reasonably robust solution to

	\direction{ }={ }ABC

but my real point was "should one do so ?".  Unless processing
an existing file within which immutable strings of the form
RTL and LTR already exist, it is (IMHO) better to stick to normal
TeX paradigms and to program either

	\let \direction = <control sequence>

		or

	\direction = {brace-delimited balanced text}

If you are willing to adopt \magnification hacks, then
the former can be simplified to

	\direction = <control sequence>

Such solutions will almost certainly be cleaner and more robust
than any attempt to handle \direction = ABC directly.

Wolfgang's code is redundant both in the definition and testing. 
The core of his idea is:

    \def\direction=#1 {\def\currentdirection{#1}}

The problem (noted by Paul and Phil) is that it is somewhat difficult with TeX 
to catch a "parameter word" with varying "word" delimiters. Wolfgang chose 
delimiters "=" and " ", which of course fails when " " is replaced by anything else. 
And even the "=": TeX allows assignments with or without "=", 
while Wolfgang's suggestion fails with 

    \direction RTL

I.e., it is "difficult" to emulate TeX's assignment parsing by macros. 
(Well, \@ifnextchar= etc. ...)
A similar problem has been noted with the FiNK package: 
It is "difficult" to replace \input by a self-defined macro.
-- Ah, cf. Phil on "\magnification hacks" ...

\set... is so obvious, and with this construction I wonder why anyone 
should want to have an "=" assignment syntax. I have defined such commands 
so often and now think that I could use "\MakeSet":

    \def\MakeSet#1{%
      \expandafter\edef\csname set#1\endcsname{%
        \def\expandafter\noexpand\csname#1\endcsname}}
    \MakeSet{direction}

Because those of us that have Plain TeX running through

"LaTeX" think that way :-)

But 

    \def\direction=#1#2 {\def\currentdirection{#1#2}}

is superior in allowing ("optional"!) spaces after "=" 
in using \direction.

But one might say that " " is the best choice for the right delimiter, 
and the documentation may say that a space as right delimiter 
is required, so its your fault if you try another one. 
(TeXbook somewhere: "If you are upset about this,
 you shouldn't be.")

The semicolon would be another nice right delimiter, 
reminding of closing commands in other areas of computation. 

Below I am varying my former \MakeSet to get a setup 
for assignment commands with space or semicolon as right delimiter. 
The tests use the exclamation mark to show effects of blank spaces 
after the assignment command. You see that there is no problem 
in this respect with space as right delimiter, but it is with semicolon 
(of course). 

space delimits:\par
 \def\MakeCurrentSpace#1{%
 \expandafter\edef\csname#1\endcsname=##1##2 {%
 \def\expandafter\noexpand\csname current#1\endcsname{##1##2}}}
 \MakeCurrentSpace{direction}
 \show\direction
 !\direction= RTL Direction!\currentdirection!\par
 !\direction= LTR Direction!\currentdirection!\par
 !\direction = RTL  Direction!\currentdirection!\par
 !\direction = LTR  Direction!\currentdirection!\par
 !\direction = RTL   Direction!\currentdirection!\par
 !\direction = LTR   Direction!\currentdirection!\par
 \smallskip
 semicolon delimits:\par
 \def\MakeCurrentSemicolon#1{%
 \expandafter\edef\csname#1\endcsname=##1##2;{%
 \def\expandafter\noexpand\csname current#1\endcsname{##1##2}}}
 \MakeCurrentSemicolon{direction}

 !\direction = RTL; Direction!\currentdirection!\par

Hi folks
What package would the list recommend for a `project proposal'? The 
document would consist of project title, description, the nature of 
the project (whatever that means), not forgetting the author's name 
and other relevant personal details.
i thought of using the `article' package and the section macros for 
the various parts of the document but I'm not sure if they're best 
suited for the purpose.

Any advice would be gratefully received.

And Wolfgang's original

\def\direction#1=#2#3 {...}

also allows optional space before "=", which might happen under some 
circumstances. It actually allows any "filler".

Both solutions I have adopted in some places, instead of braces. You've 
asked earlier why using the "=" syntax, and Phil mentioned plain TeX. 
I'll elaborate and say: you can make do without braces in many cases, 
something LaTeX seems to want its users to forget. I for one hate them, 
for no good reason but anyway, and I always welcome alternatives 
(starting with TeX's syntax for assignments).

My previous posting was the result of carefully checking this, 
it turns out that the parameter at the left of "=" is not needed 
for allowing 

    \direction        = RTL

it already works with my suggestion above.
I did post code that demonstrated this -- 
finally this is anyway clear from TeX's parsing rules 
(under usual catcodes): 
"=" is the next token after \direction that TeX realizes 
(I am unable to learn the "mouth/stomach" terms 
 for a better explanation right now, and cannot 
 look up the TeXbook chapter, I think this happens 
 already at tokenizing, i.e., the tokenizing function 
 is TeX's only part that knows about spaces after 
 "\direction".).

So the "#1=#2#3" really is redundant, I only admitted 
that it is not as redundant as I had claimed before.

PI> It actually allows any "filler".

You may be right with some additional requirements, 
e.g. when somebody insists that 

    \Direction{} = RTL

should work with 

    \def\Direction#1{\direction}

("! Use of \direction doesn't match its definition.")

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

I seem to share some feelings without being able to determine the exact amount:

"=" may make the code more intuitive, helps to see that it is an assignment 
as opposed to, say, a formatting instruction for a text argument. 

I have guessed that the rationale of LaTeX's restricted syntax is 
that absolute beginners should not be confused with too many 
kinds of syntax. Some people have been told 
"write a thesis on ... with LaTeX and give to me in six months from now!" ... 
With the "Short Introduction to LaTeX", I really was able to produce 
fine text after a few days.

So I realize another difference: the usual key-value syntax would be 

    direction=RTL

-- without the leading backslash. This observation makes me suggest a single macro \macroassignment:

    \macroassignment{direction=RTL}

that eventually executes \def\direction{RTL}.

You can make an even smarter \assignment that finds out whether \direction is macro or a register. 

I think you can adopt something from existing packages for this, e.g., fontspec seems to use optional macro arguments with key-value syntax.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Hear, hear!

I could never figure out why LaTeX is so fixated on using braces at
every possible {opportunity}.

Not that anyone asked, but I tend to write my plain TeX macros to
either have space delimited arguments or to have \par end the arg
list.

For example, my \Section macro is defined thusly:
	\def\Section #1 \par
	{
	    ....
	}

and used thusly



\Section All Graphs are Reconstructable

In this section ...


Certainly, Bad Things happen if I forget the blank line.  But I like
the blank line for reading ease, and there are so many creative ways
to botch up TeX input anyway that adding one more is really not an
issue (for me).

Cheers.

I am, myself, a little wary of using line-end (implied \par)as a delimiter
although I know I sometimes do so, but there is lots
of punctuation available for use in delimited arguments, and the 
arguments can
be of astonishing length.  I have to set book reviews in a journal, and 
it is a great
convenience to be able to import the entire content of a copy-edited 
manuscript
into a four-argument macro

\review<first argument, all the publication info delimited by>
\BEGIN                                                                 % 
Note that, since it is a delimiter, \BEGIN simply disappears.
                                                                              % in a separate context you could still use the name,
                                                                               % although it would surely be a bad idea
<entire text of review delimited by>
\reviewer
<reviewer identification terminated by the only {} argument, which 
contains the
the reviewer's affiliation>

That is extremely easy to proofread, and allows the use of standard 
macros for
things like italics in the text of the review.

I have always felt that delimited macro arguments were sadly underused.

`article' may be easier to adjust to your purpose than `dfgproposal':

There seem to be so many packages for "easy" table formatting,

Phil, you can be happy that you don't have to type curly braces on a
German keyboard.  In this respect plain TeX is a bit more convenient.

However, LaTeX aims to separate content and layout.  I regard LaTeX's
part describing the content more as a markup language rather than a
programming language.  IMO a markup language should be simple, i.e. 
depend on a very small set of well defined syntax rules.  This is
actually the case in LaTeX.

Introducing assignments to LaTeX's markup language (except in optional
arguments) seems wrong to me.  It makes things less consistent, causes
unnecessary problems (consider spell checkers, syntax highlighting,
...), and makes LaTeX more difficult to learn.

LaTeX's programming interface for defining the layout is another
story.  It's currently a mixture of LaTeX macros and TeX primitives
and therefore everything but consistent.  LaTeX 3 will definitely
provide a much more consistent interface.

Plain TeX and LaTeX are completely different things, with a different
syntax and different aims.  The worst thing one can do is to mix them
up.  It's true that \foo=3pt is more convenient to type than
\setlength{\foo}{3pt} (especially on a German keyboard), but it's also
a matter of fact that it's easier to type curly braces rather than
"begin" and "end".  

Introducing assignments in LaTeX is similar to replacing "begin"/"end"
keywords by curly braces in PASCAL.  I'm wondering why nobody provided
such a convenient version of PASCAL already.  It's easy to achieve.
Well, in PASCAL curly braces already have a meaning, but this is not a
problem at all.  The solution is to introduce \catcode and you can
change the meaning of any character you type whenever you want.

LaTeX is less flexible in this respect.  Deliberately!  It provides a
clean, well defined, user interface instead.

Programming in TeX is a challenge indeed.  You can be proud if you get
a problem solved over the weekend, even though it's just one line of
simple code in any reasonable programming language.  I assume that
LuaTeX is only good for quiche eaters.

The "circumstances" I had in mind are more contrived, e.g. \direction 
being the result of expansion:

\def\whatever#1{...\direction}
\whatever{...}   = RTL

To mimick assignments you need the first argument, otherwise \direction 
won't match its definition.

Bad that nobody answered, you might have been more successful mailing to texlive at tug.org, cf.

it might help to reboot windows or remove the installer programme, and

I've seen it before, but it went away after redownloading or rebooting.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikbK3X8w+S1bNZ0ZO3dQZOL49YZHO3LduvUD=CB@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there, I'm making an abbreviation list, and while I was reading its
documentation file for getting started with it I came accross the Kopka
style.

I'd like to use an abbreviation list that bears this style, I've tried to
assemble the code, but I'm receiving several errors,

Even when I carefully edit the nomencl.sty and replace the parts that are
supposed to be replaced, it gives the same error (something related with par
and linebreak)

so, can someone help me on this?

Thanks in advance

The Verbatim environment is very very special, Vafa, as
I'm sure you realise (it had to be, to accomplish what
it does).  It is almost certainly looking for a very
specific final delimiter, and will fail if that final
delimiter cannot be found.

Cf :

     \documentclass {article}
     \begin {document}
     \begin {abstract}
     \end {abstract}
     \begin {verbatim}
     \end {verbatim}
     \end {document}

Notice how the simple addition of one blank
space between \end and {verbatim} is sufficient
to cause it to throw exactly the same wobbly as
in your case, whereas for the Abstract environment
it causes no problems at all.

Message-ID: <14F9E8297B03F740B94AE3BEDBE8995E01263CF166D3@OAK.towson.edu>

To prepare the second edition of my book, Birkhauser wants me to use the "svmono" package (I am attaching the package mono.zip).

I am currently using PCTeX 5, which was recently installed in my computer and I am not quite familiar with it. For example, I don't know in which folder specific files such as "style files" are located. My question is this:

Where does this package go? Should the files be pasted in different files or all in one place , and where would that be?!

I would be extremely grateful for any help with this.



Sincerely,

Houshang Sohrab



P.S. I just got the following comments from Birkhauser, but I am not sure what he means by "WORKING DIRECTORY". I will ask him, but still I would be grateful for your comments because they don't seem to be working with PCTeX and may not be as familiar with it as you are and I may need need other packages to be installed as he claims.. Here is what he suggests:


Dear Professor Sohrab,

You do not have to install the SVMono package in order to use it. The easiest way to get started with SVMono is to copy the document class into your working directory where you have the LaTeX source of your manuscript. The document class is named svmono.cls and is available in the "styles" directory of the zip archive, svmono.zip. If you plan on using makeindex or BibTeX, you will also need to copy the makeindex style file (svind.ist) as well as the BibTeX styles (*.bst) into your working directory. The "templates" directory contains sample LaTeX source files that could also serve as templates on which to pattern your own LaTeX source. The file book.tex within the "templates" directory may be used a sample of your main LaTeX file. Also included in the zip archive are author instructions, a quick start guide and a reference guide for SVMono, all in PDF format.

I would suggest you try copying the contents of the templates directory to a separate directory on your computer. Copy the file svmono.cls from the styles directory into this directory and then run LaTeX on the file book.tex. You may have to install a few LaTeX packages that are not included in PCTeX but are required to use SVMono correctly. All of the packages that Springer recommends that you use are available on CTAN (http://www.ctan.org/). If you need help with installing any of them, please do let me know.

Regards,
Rajiv Monsurate

The easiest way to get started with SVMono is to copy the document class into your working directory where you have the LaTeX source of your manuscript. The document class is named svmono.cls and is available in the "styles" directory of the zip archive, svmono.zip. If you plan on using makeindex or BibTeX, you will also need to copy the makeindex style file (svind.ist) as well as the BibTeX styles (*.bst) into your working directory. The "templates" directory contains sample LaTeX source files that could also serve as templates on which to pattern your own LaTeX source. The file book.tex within the "templates" directory may be used a sample of your main LaTeX file. Also included in the zip archive are author instructions, a quick start guide and a reference guide for SVMono, all in PDF format.

Copy the file svmono.cls from the styles directory into this directory and then run LaTeX on the file book.tex. You may have to install a few LaTeX packages that are not included in PCTeX but are required to use SVMono correctly. All of the packages that Springer recommends that you use are available on CTAN (http://www.ctan.org/). If you need help with installing any of them, please do let me know.

without looking at mono.zip I would suggest just placing the files from 
mono.zip into the directory where you have your article soruces

most LaTeX installations will first look in the currect directory before 
looking at the LaTeX dist. for files.

Dear Professor Sohrab,

The key (as you have already realised) is in the phrase
"Copy all these files to your working directory", to be
found in the "readme.txt" file in your ZIP archive.  By
this, the author means the same directory as that in which
you currently have your LaTeX document, and the author
therefore assumes that you will set this as your default
directory (using, e.g., "CD") before asking PC-TeX to
process your document.

Subject: [texhax] Choosing TeX um ... stuff
Message-ID: <AANLkTin0Ys19vOC2tvcaK+1_5wbsZEMfmz+_jw1+U9Cu@mail.gmail.com>

I've been on the periphery of TeX for years, as a casual user of LaTeX and
also as an implementer of publishing software.  However, I'm afraid I
haven't kept in as close touch as I'd like, and now I find myself trying to
absorb a lot in a short time.  I'm trying to choose what software to use in
building an XML->TeX workflow.

I'd appreciate any help with the following questions:


   1. True or False: TeX can be categorized along three orthogonal axes:
      1. by format (plain TeX, LaTeX, ConTeXt, others?)
      2. by implementation (web2c, pdfTeX/pdfLaTeX, LuaTeX, others?)
      3. by distribution (MikTeX, TeXLive, MacTeX, others?)

      2. True or False: plain TeX and LaTeX(2e) are warhorses ... been
   around for decades, quirks well known, lots of documentation, etc.

   3. True or False: ConTeXt is newer, with a lot of built-in features, but
   still changing quite a bit from build to build.


Other comments welcome vis. picking which software to use.  One point is
that since the actual TeX input files will be generated programmatically,
readability or ease-of-coding is not a factor.  I was going to use plain
TeX, but it seems a lot of features like placing text boxes and graphics
anywhere, using system fonts, etc. are more available for LaTeX and ConTeXt.

Thank you for any comments!

2) is false; whilst "web2c" is a methodology and
an basis for implementation, pdfTeX is a derivative,
pdfLaTeX is simply LaTeX layered on top of PdfTeX,
LuaTeX is a major fork, and so on.

Yes, except that while Plain TeX has more-or-less remained
static (modulo essential bug fixes by Don), LaTeX2e has
continued to evolve.  I have heard rumours that this particular
evolutionary branch may have come to an end, but I have
no definite knowledge of this.

Context is a L O T newer : it has many devotees, but is still
something of an outside to mainstream TeX usage.

Talk to River Valley and/or Sebastian Rahtz; both have considerable

And plain TeX doesn't have a lot of documentation. Anyway there isn't much to
document. Basically using plain TeX means you need a very good knowledge of the
engine, and you'll write tons of macros (in a way there are no plain TeX users,
only users of personal formats based on plain).

Philip, plain TeX isn't exactly mainstream anymore, and ConTeXt probably beats
it on this point. And ConTeXt is already more than 15 years old, so it's not so
new, although it does keep moving.

Thanks for all the information, and for helping me update and refine my 
view of the (TeX) world.

For the project I'm doing now, which involves creating "desktop 
publishing type" documents (multiple text flows, explicit control of 
placement of text and graphic elements, etc.), ConTeXt seems to be 
winning hand's down.  I may also be using the XML features, so that's 
another plus.

However, I'm also attracted by the stability and widespread use of plain 
TeX and LaTeX.

It's clear from this that whatever path I take, there are lots of very 
knowledgeable and helpful people to get me over the hurdles.

Thank you!

In general true, just a tiny detail; ConTeXt has several formats:
- English (cont-en), Dutch (cont-nl), German (cont-de), ... [not too
interesting to you, I guess ...]
- ConTeXt MKII and ConTeXt MKIV are somehow different formats, but
that distinction is already made on the engine basis

There are other formats like cstex, cslatex, ..., but they are not too
important.

> by implementation (web2c, pdfTeX/pdfLaTeX, LuaTeX, others?)

No, that is called "by engine": tex, pdftex, xetex, luatex are the
most important ones. Others not too important are known (ptex, ...)

MikTeX and TeX Live are not compatible, but I'm not sure how to classify that.

> by distribution (MikTeX, TeXLive, MacTeX, others?)

MacTeX is basically TeX Live, repackaged for Mac in a more
user-friendly way. Another important distribution for ConTeXt users is
"ConTeXt Minimals". There are many other distributions (w32tex, ...),
many of them obsolete by now (gwTeX, tetex, emtex, fptex, ...). The
most important ones are just MikTeX and TeX Live (including MacTeX),
plus minimals for ConTeXt users.

Using system fonts depends on engine. Only XeTeX and LuaTeX allow
that. You can use any system font with plain XeTeX, but it's slightly
easier to access the fonts with LaTeX and ConTeXt. (But if you
generate the output automatically, it hardly makes a difference.)

ConTeXt makes an enormous difference in layout issues.

Hi I want to know if there is any Tex program that can convert to pdf's 
on the server, not on the client.  For instance if we upload the files 
to the server where the program is, the conversion can be done directly 
on the server and the pdf output.

Thank you,

see remarks by Mojca: engines (etex, pdftex, xetex, luatex), 
implementation (web2c, etc), pdflatex is just a format

the latex kernel yes, styles and extensions is another matter

depends on what you use ... you're not a demanding power user in terms 
of typeserting and the basic mechanism are ok (mkii does not change at 
all, while mkiv is developed in sync with luatex)

fyi, there are two versions of context:

- mkii is a frozen snapshot of context that runs on top of pdftex and xetex
- mkiv is the mainstream version and runs on top of luatex; it is a 
rathere drastic rewrite + major upgrade and many internals are pretty 
new but is mostly downward compatible as well

All true, except for the first part, where there is plenty of
documentation available : The TeXbook, TeX by Topic, SvB's
mammoth \TeX} in Practice, plus many others listed at Nelson
Beebe's http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub//tex/bib/texbook1.html

In that case, I believe you'd be well-served by using xmltex which nicely extends LaTeX so as to be able to directly typeset xml.

I've begun using it here at work (at my previous job we used some Plain TeX macros written by Jeff McArthur) and once I got past a stupid typo on my part and puzzled out how to make an xexmltex format, found it to be easily understandable and customizable.

Nice appendix on it in the book _Digital Typography Using LaTeX_.

Most likely textpos doesn't really put anything on the page, as far as
LaTeX is concerned. Try "~\newpage".

Subject: [texhax] Weirdness with bold,
	italic and colored text and the fontspec package
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=xNSYth=1i2b=HgNJf28DfWT_d0+rGGCMU3i-g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to use the fontspec package, and also use xcolor to specify
colored text, which may also be bold or italic.  However, as the example
below demonstates, I get some weirdness with XeTeX v3.1415926-2.2-0.9997.4
(MiKTeX 2.9).  Specifically, it seems like each time a change one of the
attributes (color, bold, italic), the very next glyph is drawn correctly,
but then the following glyphs are drawn roman, regardless of the italic
setting.  Any clues?

Here's the sample:


%%!TEX TS-program = latex

\documentclass{article}


\usepackage{fontspec}

 %\usepackage[usenames]{color}

\usepackage{xcolor}

\definecolor{color13}{cmyk}{0,0.87,0.87,0}


\begin{document}


\fontsize{14}{14}

\fontspec{Minion Pro}


{\textit italic}{\fontspec[Color=color13]{Minion Pro}\textit red italic}
{\fontspec[Color=color13]{Minion Pro}\bfseries{\textit red bold
italic}}{\bfseries{\textit bold italic}}


\end{document}

Aha!  My bad.  I should have used \itshape.  I guess \textit takes one
argument ... either a character or group.

Betreff: [texhax] Problem with Appendices

Dear support

I hope this is how you do things in support...
\
I am using Latex running under Miktex 2.8 with class: amsbook.

Lenny fncychap, fancyhdr, and it all works perfectly, except...
\
In the CONTENTS list of a .dvi output (i.e. at the start of the finished pages), the word chapter appears correctly as in Chapter 1, Chapter 2, etc... up to 17 in my case.

But when it gets to the Appendices, it goes Chapter A, Chapter B, rather that Appendix A, Appendix B...
\
So the numbers change to letters as they should, but the word chapter stays as chapter.
\
The titles on the page headers in the appendices Left and Right are OK.
\
I understand that \appendix should be called ONCE only, then one should revert to \chapter ? even in appendices.
\

Hope you can help.

Regards
    Keith

Subject: [texhax] strange problem with a sty file and \catcode
Message-ID: <AANLkTimEXHsOiUrznMz85u6tKr07u50TSRFpdPE1umMy@mail.gmail.com>

If i create a simple sty file, say mypackage.sty which includes:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
\ProvidesPackage{mypackage}
\catcode`$=11
\newcommand*{\eqcommand}[2]{%
\expandafter\@ifdefinable  \csname#1\endcsname{%
\expandafter\let\csname#1\expandafter\endcsname\csname#2\endcsname}}
\eqcommand{new$command}{newcommand}
\endinput
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

then this tex file gives error:

 \documentclass{article}

\usepackage{mypackage}

\new$command\test{Test}

\begin{document}

This is a test\TeX

\end{document}


and the error is:


! Undefined control sequence.

<recently read> \new

 l.3 \new

$command\test{Test}

?


Then I I change my tex file so that I leave a blank line after
\usepackage{mypackage}, no error happens:


\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{mypackage}


\new$command\test{Test}

\begin{document}

This is a test\TeX

\end{document}


but even without using a package, this gives no error:




\documentclass{article}

\makeatletter

\catcode`$=11

\newcommand*{\eqcommand}[2]{%

\expandafter\@ifdefinable \csname#1\endcsname{%

\expandafter\let\csname#1\expandafter\endcsname\csname#2\endcsname}}

\eqcommand{new$command}{newcommand}

\makeatother

\new$command\test{Test}

\begin{document}

This is a test\TeX

\end{document}



So can you please enlighten me why this error only happens when my
definitions are inside sty file and how can I fix this?

"The other way round" -- \textit takes an argument, \bfseries does not. To apply \bfseries locally: 

    {\bfseries ...}

But for having boldface words within a "medium" line, \mathbf{...} -- takes an argument! -- is said to be better, it inserts an "italic correction" (an analogue to the italic correction) to improve horizontal spacing.

A really nice and funny observation, very instructive for learning to deal with category code changes.

\usepackage, before actually reading the package, looks for a "[" after its mandatory argument, in case there is a version request. If the command containing the new "letter" follows instead, the new command is truncated at the "new letter", because the category code change within the package hasn't been executed yet. I.e., at looking for a "[", TeX tokenizes what is ahead of the mandatory argument, and does this with the category code of the "new letter" still being the one from before the package. So after reading the package, TeX processes the next token, which is the command truncated at the "new letter".

When an empty line follows, what \usepackage finds instead of "[" is \par (I think).

What Phil Taylor may like (or he certainly would have suggested it if he had already looked at this): You can place a \relax right after the mandatory argument of \usepackage to get around this funny problem. The documentation of the new package should tell something like this.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

To be honest, I decided (a) I didn't understand enough of the
LaTeX-specific stuff to really know what was going on, and (b)
I couldn't see Vafa's rational for needing such an apparently
complex solution (OK, \new$command has a nice VMS-ish ring
to it, and \new$command_whatever even more so, but even as
a VMS freak I baulk at trying to making TeX look like DCL !).

So I decided to let someone else worry about this one :-)

in fact, ams tech-suypport responded to
the original inquiry at once (i should
have sent a cc to texhax), and requested
some additional information.

as it turned out, at least these three
packages being used overwrote the normal
conventions of amsbook:
 - appendix.sty
 - titletoc.sty
 - titlesec.sty
so it's really not an amsbook problem.

the only "simple" solution i could find
was a real hack -- add the line
  \addtocontents{toc}{\def\chaptername{Appendix}}
immediately after the line
  \appendix
in the file.  this did the trick.

let this be a warning that not all document
classes have been tested with all possible
add-on packages, and vice versa.  and the
authors of the different classes and
packages may not be intimately familiar
with the workings of the other ones.  we
do try to be helpful, so that a user will
end up with what s/he wants, but sometimes
the circumstances are just too arcane to
provide an "elegant" or "permanent" solution.

Is there a way in LaTeX, with either pdfTeX or XeTeX, to specify image and

which uses the same images multiple times, so I'd prefer the image just be
included once, and then referenced each time it's needed on a page.

Is this possible?

Here's a simple way to use images in pdfTeX:

%%%

\def\loadimage#1#2#{%
  \getimage{#1}{#2}%
  }

\def\getimage#1#2#3{%
  \pdfximage #2 {#3}%
  \expandafter\edef\csname
#1 at image\endcsname{\pdfrefximage\the\pdflastximage\relax}%
  }

\def\useimage#1{%
  \ifcsname #1 at image\endcsname
    \csname #1 at image\endcsname
  \else
    \errmessage{Image `#1' hasn't been loaded}%
  \fi
  }

%%%

Then you can use \loadimage{<name>}<specs>{<file>} and \useimage{<name>}.

The <specs> are optional, and are of the form:

width <length> height <length> depth <length>

in any order. If none is present, the image is loaded at its natural size. If
one is present, the others are scaled accordingly. Naturally an image has a
depth of 0, but you can use it anyway. For instance:

% Natural size
\loadimage{myimg}{img.jpg}

% Height scaled to match width
\loadimage{myimg} width 3cm {img.jpg}

% Image deformed, probably
\loadimage{myimg} width 3cm height 1cm {img.jpg}


I don't think multiple posting is necessary. Please stick to one list or
another, and then turn to another list if you get no answer. Which is quite rare
if you post on texhax.


Best,
Paul

Subject: [texhax] appendix numbering and page numbering
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=aM+ggmdQFiz9utUmys_t6VjXRaHDLP5FaVX1W@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have added an appendix in documentclass{report}. I want to do the
following things

1. It says it is appendix-A. But since there is only one appendix, I want to
drop the letter A in the title and in the contents
2. Appendix resets the page numbering and it starts numbering from 1 again.
I want the page numbering to be continuous till the end of the document.

Kindly help me with this.

Hi, an elementary question, but I couldn't find the answer: how could
I define an environment from a command such that an argument of it be
inside the environment.

Example:

given the next command:
\command{fix first argument}{variable second arg}{fix third arg}

Construct the next environment:
\begin{environment}
  variable second arg
\end{environment}

Hi Barbara,

thanks for the reply. I had an error with the command you gave. But I know
what it does and slightly modified it. It put an extra entry in the TOC.
Finally I got rid of the \appendix and used following commands to achieve
the goals

\clearpage

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{APPENDIX}

{\bf APPENDIX}\\

{\bf SINR DEGRADATION ANALYSIS}

\thispagestyle{plain}

There is a default spacing between these lines. Is there any way to change

If the first and third arguments are constants, you can create another
command in order to reduce the number of arguments:

\newcommand{\foo}[1]{\command{arg1}{#1}{arg3}}

 > Construct the next environment:
 > \begin{environment}
 >   variable second arg

and then you can use it in \newenvironment:

\newenvironment{bar}[1]{\foo{#1}}{}

\begin{bar}{hello}
  ...
\end{bar}

hello, bala,

    thanks for the reply. I had an error with the command you gave. But I know
    what it does and slightly modified it. It put an extra entry in the TOC.

the answer was actually to a different
(but related) question).  i'm glad you
found it helpful.

    Finally I got rid of the \appendix and used following commands to achieve
    the goals

    \clearpage

    \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{APPENDIX}

    \begin{center}

    {\bf APPENDIX}\\

    {\bf SINR DEGRADATION ANALYSIS}

    \end{center}

    \thispagestyle{plain}

    \setcounter{equation}{0}

    \renewcommand{\theequation}{A.\arabic{equation}}

there's an even better way to do this.
it's described in the ams author faq, at
  http://www.ams.org/faq?faq_id=247
  http://www.ams.org/faq?faq_id=248
the second question actually applies to
your situation better than the first, but
i want to take this opportunity to point
out this resource to other users of the
ams document classes.  the general link
for the entire faq is
  http://www.ams.org/authors/author-faq
and that has a box to enter search terms.

Yes. The alternative would be chaining commands, each eating up to 9
args. That way madness lies.

Thanks!

Let me ask the question another way.  I'm trying to output a document that
will use the same page over and over again, like a form, but with some
different text plugged in here and there, and some different images.  I'm
assuming the best (only?) way to do that is to define one or more macros to
draw the parts of the page, and pass in the text, image names, etc. as
arguments.  Any better suggestions?

P.S. - I tried using box registers to pass in the argument values, but they
always typeset in the default font and size, regardless of the paragraph
they were in.  I even used \unhcopy to just add the contents to the list,
but somehow the attributes were carried with them.

You want to catch the contents of an environment in order
to use it later as argument of a command?

\usepackage{environ}
\NewEnviron{environment}{%
  \command{fix first argument}{\BODY}{fix third arg}%
}

I did have some luck with something like:

\newcommand{\dopage}{%
Do something with \vari, \varii and variii (and as many more as I want to
define). %
}

\def\vari{First argument}
\def\varii{Second arg.}
\def\variii{Third, etc.}
\dopage

etc.  It's brute force, but it works.  Suggested improvements or
alternatives *VERY* welcome.  (Yes, there's xkeyval, but I'm actually
writing code to generate the TeX source file, so it will simply be defining
a series of variables.

Thanks,

I have always thought of some "pecking order":
When a "less important" package X turns out 
to be incompatible with a "more important"  
package Y, X must strive for compatibility.
A package from the "required" LaTeX distribution 
such as the AMS packages certainly is a 
"Very Important Package".

Once I had to do this for lineno.sty and/or 
ednotes.sty, in the sense that they can be 
loaded together with amsmath, but I 
couldn't yet afford to number amsmath 
display lines with lineno.sty.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Hi Reinhard, thanks your answer, but this is not the solution I hoped,
as you *have to* apply braces, so the argument of the command remains
an argument of the environment, and the body of the environment must
be empty.

The real problem with other words is the next:
  when I define an environment, how could I open a block in the second
argument of the \newenvironment, and how could I close it in the third
one.

Hi Heiko, thanks, this is a perfect solution, I could solve my problem
with it, but it surprised me if a package have to be applied for this
type of problem, I thought it must be elementary.

Looking at both this and the more recent messages, I have
to confess that I don't really understand what you are
trying to accomplish.  What are "fix first argument" and
"fix second argument", and if they are fixed, why do they
need to appear at all, and how is the expansion intended
to know which environment is to be used ?

very sorry if I was unundrestandable, you are right, the first and
third argument is not necessary.
So transform a \command{arg} into a
\begin{env}
   arg
\end{env}
with defining env environment. My problem was that I could not find a
  \newenvironment{env}{\command ?beginning a block? }{ ?end of the block? }
solution, where ? signs my problem. But Heiko Oberdiek gave a perfect
solution with a package.

I'm trying to use multirow in a colored table, and I'm running into a problem where the color seems to appear on top of the text in the multirow cell, thus partially obscuring the text.  Attached is the example pdf output, and the .tex file I am using.

So, is there something I'm doing wrong here, or any suggestions to fix it?  It seems to affect all the various table environments -- I tried tabular, tabularx, longtable, and supertabular.  Thanks in advance for any advice.

Greetings!

I run into trouble. I have to make layout like this:
https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B4RAQ8QLfjMkZWY5ZDIxMWUtYTNjYy00ZWQxLWI4MzktNjdkNjFhMzhlYjZk&hl=ru

I'd like to ask experts: Is such image layout possible in LaTeX? Which
tools and packages should I use?

I have 2 main problems:

? ? ?1) I don't know how to place the wrapped images on the top/bottom.
? ? ?2) If I'll make the absolute positioning (with tikz package
maybe), I don't know how to make text wrap.

I would appreciate any help.

OK, many thanks Barbara : your problem is now a lot clearer.

So in general what can be identified is that it not possible
to treat "arg" as a parameter to \command, as otherwise
catcode changes could not occur in setting up {environment}.
However, for the limits of "arg" to be known, it must be
set off by braces.  So the first thing that comes to mind
is :

	\def \command #{whatever}

where the trailing # indicates that \command must be followed
by an open brace (which will later be closed), and \command
takes no parameters so no catcode staticisation has yet
taken place.  \command can therefore be programmed to emit
"\begin {environment} :

	\def \command #{\begin {environment}}

The problem is how to insert the \end {environment} once
the closing brace is found.  As Fermat might have said
"I have a really ingenious solution, but this message is
too small to contain it".  In reality, I have to prepare
for guests and don't have time to add the final pieces;
more later, perhaps !

Can you define a control sequence in a package,  say, \me at test, such that
you can use it in your document body without using \csname me at test\endcsname
or without using \makeatletter, \makeatother in the body of your document?

To answer my own question, I searched around some more and read the comments in multirow.sty and found that the answer is to do multirow from the bottom up -- so have no value in the upper row and do multirow{-2}, like this:

\begin{tabular}{ | p{4cm} | *{3}{ >{\centering}p{2cm} |} }
\hline
\rowcolor{lightgray}
& & \multicolumn{2}{>{\columncolor{lightgray}}c|}{Gender}\tabularnewline
\rowcolor{lightgray}
\multirow{-2}*{Results} &
\multirow{-2}*{All records} & 
Male & Female \tabularnewline
\hline
test & 75\% & 80\% & 70\% \tabularnewline
\hline
\end{tabular}

This produces the attached output, which is close to what I'm looking for.  Now the only issue is this: how do I get rid of the very small (1pt it appears) lines that show up where the \hline would normally be?

Well, hyperref is, in my opinion, one of the most important packages
here.  Nevertheless Heiko does everything possible to ensure
compatibility with a lot of other packages.

Essentially not. Without \makeatletter, TeX only sees a command 
\me with a `@' ahead and some letters following. You could define 
\me to collect the `@' and the following "letters" and then call 
\csname ...\endcsname internally, i.e., you create a macro that 
mimicks/varies TeX's tokenizing, e.g., using \ifcat or so 
(ahm, niceverb in my nicetext bundle does similar tricks, 
 i.e., may provide "templates" for this purpose).

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

It's HARD in LaTeX; wrapfig may help.

But it's probably way easier with ConTeXt.

>It's HARD in LaTeX; wrapfig may help.

I have done such a thing for translation of Copernicus' 
"De Revolutionibus" for his geometrical drawings.

It was attempted roughly to keep the original dimensions 
(of his manuscript). The manuscript doesn't always "wrap" 
(or even never), often a drawing was placed in the margin, 
and often it was about as high as the entire text of the page.

It was decided to mimick/vary this by wrapping.

The difficulties now were 
(i) placement of the figures had to be revised manually sometimes, 
in order to have at least (if possible) a part of a geometrical proof 
on the same spread as the figure illustrating it; 
(ii) almost always it was impossible to place a figure 
in the first line of a paragraph, as no paragraph nearby 
was high enough.

Paragraphs were typically very long. 
Therefore I usually placed figures at the top of a page 
by moving them inside a paragraph to an appropriate line. 
Sometimes I needed to modify the adjustment of section 
titles and other paragraphs so a figure had enough 
vertical space. 

According to my memory, wrapfig etc. allow moving a figure 
in a paragraph by determining a position in the text code 
where a line break looks good. I considered this too messy 
for revising positions. As it was a critical edition, I used 
lineno.sty functionality to make a macro roughly saying 
"place the figure after the nth line of the present paragraph". 
I thought of measuring the appropriate number of lines 
automatically, but didn't have the time for this.
And I couldn't afford to make a release of the respective 
version of lineno.sty and that extra package. 

Now I realize here that this could be made perhaps simpler 
with Plain TeX, still not attempting automatical position.

I am sketching a very manual approach so you see what 
would happen, I leave it to others to "wrap" this into a macro
that automates the operations so it has about two 
parameters, one for "place after nth line", one for including 
the figure (and a caption). 

First, you set \parshape according to TeXbook p. 101 
to make room for the figure. You determine k such that 
k\baselineskip is sufficiently larger than the height of the 
figure (plus the caption and its distance to the figure 
-- with Copernicus' drawings the caption often could 
be placed inside a rectangle spanned by the drawing). 

Set m := n+k+1 and

    \parshape = m i_1 l_1 ... i_m l_m 

such that 

    i_j = 0pt    and    l_j = \linewidth

iff either j less than or equal to n, or j = m; otherwise 

    i_j = w       and    l_j = \linewidth - w

where w is sufficiently larger than the width of the figure. 

Well this was for putting the figure to the left of the paragraph, 
otherwise replace i_j = w by i_j = 0pt. 

Second, start the paragraph with something like 

    \leavevmode\hbox to 0pt{%
        \vtop to 0pt{%
            \vskip n\baselineskip 
            [\hfil?]\hbox{[FIGURE+CAPTION]}[\hfil?%?]
            \vss
        }\hss
    }

I used lineno.sty to replace that vertical placement by a 
macro obeying something like 
"place the figure here, if this is the nth line of the paragraph".
My present proposal may be simpler, the lineno approach, 
on the other hand, can cope with single "vertically 
oversized" lines. 

I might send my package that performed some of these operations. 

Don't worry, be happy!

    Uwe.

A Very Important Point. 

hyperref certainly is a Very Important Package. 
Since about one and a half year, I have considered nonsense 
not using hyperref as soon as a document needs a 
table of contents, moreover links to the web or other 
documents are so nice.

A Very Important Package Y such as hyperref or amsmath 
simply may be too difficult to understand for the authors of package X 
such as lineno.sty. So unless I get some heavy funding, 
one may hope that the maintainers of Y understand X 
and can provide a compatibility hack. ((i) This may be difficult 
with X = lineno.sty. (ii) Alex Rozhenko's afterpackage 
is nice for such hacks.)

Thanks for reading, 

    Uwe.

Have you studied the documentation section reporting on \newpage?
I don't understand it quickly, have considered, not used the package.

Thanks to all for clarifying this!

I confess I have not read the documentation all the way through.  Life's a
trade-off between understanding and doing.  I guess I erred too much on the
latter side this time.  Sorry.

Thank you!

Just to follow up on my own question, more generally, are there ways to hook
into the PDF generation of either PDFTeX or XeTeX?

I'm interested in, among other things, being able to define form XObjects
that will be reused across multiple pages of the output.  Is there a way to
do that?

Generally, is there a way to insert metadata into the PDF that could be used
from some post-process?

Thanks!

Thanks!  Anyone know if XeTeX has a facility like this?  I think I need the
font, language and UTF-8 support that XeTeX has.

Thanks.  Actually, it appears from the manual that \pdfinfo can only be used
for the info section of the document.

I believe so - pdftex, xetex and luatex are very compatible. Try for
yourself. :-)

You didn't specify what kind of "metadata". XMP is easy with \pdfobj.

That sounds exactly the problem  \null\newpage or (equivalently) \hbox{}\newpage should work, too.

Yes -- as Uwe notes, there's a section in the documentation discussing this.

I've added a \tableofcontents to the front of the documentation, which may help with this.

Well, XeTeX 3.1415926-2.2-0.9997.4 doesn't appear to recognize \pdfxform,
unless there's some package that defines this that I'm unaware of.  I just
tried this sample code I had found at
http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.text.tex/2010-04/msg00087.html

% minimal example:
% ----------------------------------------------------------

\documentclass[a4paper]{minimal}

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\begin{document}\makeatletter

First example:


\setbox\z@\hbox{Hello world !}

\begingroup

\pdfxform\z@\pdfrefxform\pdflastxform% globally voids \box\z@

\endgroup


\ifvoid\z@

The box is now void !

\else

\copy\z@

\fi


Second example:


\setbox\z@\hbox{Hello world !}

\begingroup

\setbox\z@\hbox{\copy\z@}

\pdfxform\z@\pdfrefxform\pdflastxform% locally voids \box\z@

\endgroup


\ifvoid\z@

The box is now void !

\else

\copy\z@

\fi


\end{document}\endinput


The XeTeX doc I have xetexmain.pdf doesn't mention this either.

Some time ago I wrote and released a new package "cals", which natively
supports basic, but not so easy with the standard packages, table
formatting. Your test table can be coded as:

\begin{calstable}
\alignC
\makeatletter
\def\cals at framecs@width{.4pt }
\def\cals at framers@width{.4pt }
\def\cals at bgcolor{lightgray}
\brow
 \nullcell{lrt}
 \nullcell{lrt}
 \nullcell{ltb}
 \nullcell{rtb}\spancontent{Gender}
\erow
\brow
 \nullcell{lrb}\alignL\spancontent{\vfil Results}
 \nullcell{lrb}\alignC\spancontent{\vfil All records}
 \cell{Male}
 \cell{Female}
\erow
\def\cals at bgcolor{}
\brow
 \alignL\cell{test}\alignC
 \cell{75\%}
 \cell{80\%}
 \cell{70\%}
\erow
\end{calstable}

This may work with inclusion of external graphics from files, with TeX
boxes it doesn't:

\setbox0=\hbox{Hello World!}\copy0\copy0\copy0

does not create a Form XObject to be inserted on every \copy0, at least
at my end.

The XeTeX syntax for creating Form XObjects is different from pdfTeX
(see the dvipdfm manual):

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\newsavebox\mybox
\savebox\mybox{\fbox{Hello world!}}

\begin{document}
\makeatletter

%distills \mybox into Form XObject for later reuse
\makebox[0pt][l]{%
\special{pdf:bxobj @myform
  width \strip at pt\wd\mybox pt
  height \strip at pt\ht\mybox pt
  depth \strip at pt\dp\mybox pt}%
\usebox\mybox%
\special{pdf:exobj}%
}

%reuse of Form XObject
\special{pdf: uxobj @myform}
\vspace{5ex}
\special{pdf: uxobj @myform}
\vspace{5ex}
\special{pdf: uxobj @myform}

\makeatother
\end{document}

No, you need to declare the XObject as such:

\setbox0=\hbox{Hello world.}
\pdfxform0
\pdfrefxform\pdflastxform

Note that box 0 is empty after the second line. So pdfTeX does that
automatically for you... once you know the right command :)

Paul

I know the right command.

The topic poster repeatedly asked for the Xe(La)TeX way of creating
Form XObjects. Your code is pdfTeX specific and will definitely not work
with XeTeX.

\special{pdf:bxobj ...}
\special{pdf:exobj ...}
\special{pdf:uxobj ...}

are the XeTeX (and dvipdfmx and dvipdfm) equivalents, as I wrote in my
previous message.

Thanks *VERY* much for clearing this up.  This was about my last real
concern about moving forward with XeTeX, so I'm quite comfortable with that
as a platform.

To summarize my impressions:

- I really need the ability to add and specify fonts very easily, and from
what I've learned, XeTeX seems to be preferable to pdfTeX for that.

- I need to add support for right-to-left, vertical, bidi and other writing
system variations.

- I'd like to have support for micro-typography at some point, and I gather
this has also been added to XeTeX in some fashion.

- LuaTeX seems very promising in features, but is still a work in progress.

Thank you!

My apologies to Alexander for implying that perhaps he'd missed the right
primitives in pdfTeX :)

Just for the record: it's a very usable work in progress. I use it everyday, and
I've never encountered any major problem.

Thanks, Paul.  Would you says it's stable enough to redistribute to a bunch
of non-TeX-savvy users, for whom thoughput is the primary concern?  If you
had to support them?

I'm not doubting.  I'm just trying to evaluate the options.

Thank you.

I guess so. If you have to support anything related to TeX, you need to know TeX
itself (no simple task, but doable despite what can be heard here and there);
LuaTeX won't make much of a difference, if you don't use LuaTeX features
(meaning you don't need extra knowledge).

I didn't mean that LuaTeX would be better suited than XeTeX for your needs,
though; I have no answer to that. I just wanted to claim, in front of the entire
TeX community: yes, you can use LuaTeX right now! But I know I sometimes verge
on fanatism when it comes to that :)

Best,
Paul

That's what I meant by ``an image'', but you're right, it's good to have the specific clarification.

Though the character protrusion code of pdfTeX is already in XeTeX's
svn repository, but I doubt that it's actually used by XeTeX.  And
font expansion is much more difficult to implement.  I don't expect
anything to happen soon, especially because the author has not much
time ATM.

Hi Nitsan,

 

I read a post of yours online where you were having trouble with LaTeX.
Did you ever get your issue with the Elsevier class files not outputting
anything because of the upsy.fd file? 

 

I am having the exact same issue as you described, and if you found a
work-around, I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know what it
was.

 

Thanks,

David

Just to be really clear, by "character protrusion," are we talking about
margin kerning, or what InDesign calls "optical margin alignment"?

Also, by "font expansion," do we mean what InDesign calls "glyph scaling"?

Both "identities" are true, according to Wikipedia:

I didn't know about InDesign

I hope this will propagate to the microtype and pdfcprot packages, 
Cc'ing their authors.

Hi Karl,
you are obviously right, I just tried:

$ xetex \\relax
This is XeTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.2-0.9997.4 (TeX Live 2010)
 restricted \write18 enabled.
entering extended mode

*\show\rpcode
> \rpcode=\rpcode.

  Reinhard

It already did quite a while ago: the microtype beta version available 
from http://xetex.tk supports protrusion with xetex and luatex.

Also, I've come across rumours that font expansion is going to be 
implemented in xetex in the not-so-distant future.

Yes, except pdfTeX is a little bit subtler.

First, font expansion can be used after the lines have been justified 
(\pdfadjustspacing=1), in which case TeX builds the paragraph without 
expansion and applies it in a cosmetic fashion afterward, so lines look 
better, or it can be used in the justification process 
(\pdfadjustspacing=2).

Second, each character has an \efcode that sets how much it can be 
expanded, in thousandth of the expansion defined for the font it belongs 
to. I'm not sure it makes a difference to the naked eye, though.

Best,
Paul

This is an FAQ:

Look at the documentclass combine on CTAN.

Hi, we want to install Tex Live on a server and be able to send .tex 
files to it and have them compiled to pdf and available on the server.  
Is this possible? If so , what kind of server does it have to be and is 
there anyone on this list who can do the installation for us (paid of 
course).
How would the connection if this is possible be done from the client side?
thank you

Yes, you can. However I guess you need more than just TeXlive.

What I have done a while ago was to set up a PHP-based webpage which took
TeX code via html form and converted it to PDF.

However I would do this not in the internet but only in an intranet since it
takes a good portion of knowledge to make such a server *really* secure. If
you want to know more, drop me a line.

Yes, you can. We have done this at
http://www.parsilatex.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=84&Itemid=83

It uses xepersian to typeset documents in Persian using LaTeX over XeTeX.
Xepersian is a macro package that localises LaTeX and TeX.

Step three, the calling of the tex processor, must be
done through a system call (since AFAIK there
are no other language bindings and tex is still
essentially stand-alone)

In a language like Perl you can use the system()
or backtick method, or in python use os.system()

These construct and pass a command-line request
exactly like you might at the console, but with
the uploaded .tex files substituted in place.

The danger here, is that someone who knew the 
processing method could type a malicious command
unless some careful work is done to protect the
server.

In addition to rigorously filtering the input
you could use a password to restrict the system 
to trusted users, and 'hide' the processing URL
by not making a link public.

Interesting, Vasa.  Do you also have an "Upload file"
version ?  It seems to me that "Upload file" is
likely to be the preferred approach for many potential
users.

That looks like a great start on the problem.

My guess is that it's really designed for 
rather short TeX snippets such as a single
equation or image that can be included inline
with HTML. How it would fare rendering large
documents?

Another issue is that while it's relatively
easy to process a single, self-contained
document serverside, many real-world documents
could require dependent images or table data,
and that would lead to a more complex system
for file management. 
My solution would be to keep a pool of uploaded
files in the users/session directory that are
either overwritten by new uploads or deleted 
after one hour on a cron job by timestamp.

Subject: [texhax] Who is using biblatex?
Message-ID: <FD3B6F22-FD65-4BBA-8EEE-19592CEA2F78@alphabyte.co.nz>

Hi all,

(Apologies for the cross post, something seems to be wrong with MacOSX-TeX at email.esm.psu.edu 
)

Been looking this morning at switching over to biblatex in order to  
remedy an apparent problem I have with some reference types and  
apacite. I have made an engine for TeXShop to run bibtex8.

Essentially I have been looking at what might be required for a switch  
to APA 6th from 5th. The biblatex bib file is a very different looking  
beast to a bibtex bib file and mine is about 176kb (a lot of  
references to convert).

 From what I have seen biblatex seems to have got some good press and  
application appears to be quite logical. There is also the nice  
looking biblatex-apa.

Is there anyone on the list that is currently using this (biblatex or  
biblatex-apa)? Apart from the major changes to structure (and I am  
afraid I am very comfortable with bibtex field structures), are there  
any issues you found?

I don't use a bib database like BibDesk. I just use TeXshop as a text  
editor to maintain the bib file and link citations.

Cheers
Alan

Hello,

has somebody tried the package "vertbars". This runs (internally) with the lineno-package and 
in its information provides a "switch" option, which should assure that the produced "bar" is on the outside of the page (even if twoside) automatically. But the switch option does not work,. With usepackage{vertbars} I get all bars on the left side, 
with usepackage[switch]{vertbars} no bars at all.

Any help welcome. 
With best regards
hh

I have been using both biblatex and biblatex-apa for since biblatex 0.6. I
haven't had to change anything in my bib files, except for one thing: if
you're used to typing "Sept" for the month field in your bibtex days, you
must now change it to the number "9". Month fields in biblatex accept only a
number in the 1 - 12 range.

Hope that helps,

Best regards,

Thanks Lian,

Looking at the sample bib files, they appeared to be quite different  
to what I have, especially where there are multiple authors. The  
different title types are interesting.

I think most of the changes I would be making are the in-text  
citations which use apacite style commands. I suppose most can be  
easily swapped out.

How do you handle cross-references for, example, multiple in-book, in- 
proceedings, etc. references? I couldn't find anything explicit in the  
documentation.

Thanks
Alan

I think the sample bib files included "interesting" scenarios on purpose to
showcase biblatex's capabilities. My experience is that existing bibtex .bib
files can be used directly in biblatex (bar the numeric month fields)

I'm not quite sure what you're looking for, do you mean
\parencite{Smith:2001,Doe:2003}? That would give you (Smith, 2001; Doe,
2003).

	crossref = {Heidegger1993book},
	Title = {The question concerning technology},
	OriginalYear = {1954},
	Pages = {311--341} }

	Title = {Being and Time},
	OriginalYear = {1972},
	Pages = {41--87} }

@book{Heidegger1993book,

Subject: [texhax] xetex: using fonts with missing glyphs
Message-ID: <20101126125711.GC8862@eureca.de>

Hi folks,

I just did my first steps with xelatex and immediately ran into a problem.
I would like to use a font which has only a very sparse set of glyphs. Even
comma and fullstop are missing.

Is there an easy way to tell xelatex which font to use as fallback for
missing glyphs? (This is for glyphs that are missing completely, like the
comma.)

Is there an easy way to tell xelatex on a case-by-case basis which
glyph (or combination of glyphs) to use for a special missing glyph? (This
is for glyphs that can be replaced by existing glyphs.)

Thanks for any help,

	Susan

Hi all, I am new to this list and almost to Latex, but although I am
getting my way into it, I can not fix this hyphenation problem for the
spanish language for the document I have attached.

Te problem is that if I set a different set of hyphenation min and max
values, the paragraphs are not justified properly.

I have tried a lot of values, but the only ones that work properly are

\lefthyphenmin=2
\righthyphenmin=2

that is to say, the ones set by default for the english language.

I have also tried changing the font to the latex default one, but it
still doesn't work.

What can I do?

Hello,

I've written my dissertation in LaTeX and a school specific class file. I've
arrange the thesis in a tree-like structure with many separate .tex files
being inputted into one master file... typical setup. I am wondering if now
that I am done with this document, is it possible to get some word and
reference frequency statistics. For example, does anyone know of a tool that
could output not only the references I've used but also how many times I
cited each reference? Similarly, does any know of a tool (maybe the same
one?) where I can get a word frequency list for a document organized like
mine?

Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance.

Sam

each reference will be in the aux files, so just write a tool in any 
scripting language to retrieve the data and do analysis, should be easy 
enough

If your tree structure is a directory tree (under unix), you can
traverse the tree using my little tree script:

http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/ftp/tree

To use it you have to make sure that your analysis function(s) are in
your path.

google:
unix tree directory traversal

On Mac OS X there a package that `man traverse` describes, apparently
programming tools for tcl.  Also, the unix 'find' program might work.

At the top directory containing all the relevant files, give the command

   grep -o string  *|wc -w

replacing string with whatever word you want to count.

Or, if you really love TeX, read the .aux with redefined macros
(most just gobbling), such that the first citation of ... 
(i) creates a macro by some \csname ... ...\endcsname expanding to 1 
and 
(ii) appends some \par ...: and the macro to a list macro \listofcitations, 
next occurrences do

   ?\count@=\csname ... ...\endcsname \advance\count@\@ne 
    \expandafter\edef\csname ... ...\endcsname{\the\count@}

Use LaTeX's \@ifundefined{... ...} to test whether it's the first citation or 
another one. 

Finally write \listofcitations into a text file, then perhaps, ahm, 
by some "sort" tool, order the lines of that text file alphabetically ...

I have done a similar thing in summer, but I don't have the 
macros any more.

Happy TeXing, 

    Uwe.

It might help in understanding what "not justified properly" means 
to see a one-page sample.

I guess (just guess) that many words stick out into the right-hand 
margin. To confirm the suspection, you might use \sloppy; I guess 
then you have "proper justification", while it still looks terrible. 

In this case I guess that your latex.fmt does not contain Spanish 
hyphenation patterns, or you just missed switching into Spanish 
mode.

In the first subcase, you need to initex a new format. I cannot help much 
with this, being out of practice. One way I like is just installing 
TeX Live, then you should have almost all existing hyphenation patterns

... well, you seem to run TeX Live, but this is not the set of messages 
I know. There should be a list of all hyphenation patterns included. 
(Well, I still run TeX Live 2007.) -- You might send how this .log 
listing continues, there should be some report about the .fmt 
that was used.

In the second subcase, you need some \setlanguage ... !?
Sorry, I am out of practice with this too ...

Well, let's see if my guess is right and then somebody else might help, 
or you look up language matters yourself in any LaTeX documentation.

I even never have tried xelatex at all and may be the wrong one to answer. 

Just curious: How can this happen? What are you doing? 
Does this mean you see a glyph in the editor but it is omitted 
in the .pdf? 

If you have a font to which you want to "fall back," why don't 
you just use that other font?

For combining fonts, there have been virtual fonts, but I still must 
learn this myself, and I wonder whether it really still works with 
XeTeX.

If an extra glyph is rare, it should be possible to call it by a macro 
that simply internally and locally switches to the font containing 
the glyph.

Another solution could be with active characters in the good 
old way, but with unicode the active character is rather something 
like an active byte working like a macro with parameters 
(I guess ...)

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

I have often wondered about the same question, even read Christian 
Schenk's interview

    http://tug.org/interviews/schenk.html

in vain. What about asking on the MiKTeX mailing list?

finally I did RTFM; I was wrong.

TFM I R is Kew's paper in TUGboat 26-2. I even downloaded 
Michel Goossens' XeTeX Companion (just google).

With XeTeX, simply all characters are 16 bit. What I wrote 
came from my little experience with UTF-8.

So with XeTeX, you indeed could try things like

    \catcode`\,\active \def,{...}

Of course, this is difficult with comma-separated ... such as \fontspec 
(may need to be redefined to \catcode`\,=12 locally).

Such things become especially difficult when with hyperref 
labels contain text. In my niceverb.sty from the nicetext bundle 
I solved this by doing the \catcode assignment in the .aux as well.

Don't worry, be happy!

     Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Print Page Range
Message-ID: <DA39FDAD-B50F-45D6-8E5A-FCBF6B6A5442@fas.harvard.edu>

Hi,

	I'm looking for a solution to the following situation.

I've got a number of PDF files that I need to put together into a single document.

Desiderata:
	- Have a table of contents at the beginning of the resulting file that lists the PDF collected in the file.
	- Make the entries in that table of contents clickable so that readers are taken directly to the corresponding, included document.
	- For each included document, include a link in the table of contents that allows a reader to print just that document (perhaps by pre-populating the print dialog box).

I'm using the pdfpages package to accomplish the concatenation, and the hyperref package to accomplish the clickable links in the table of contents. But for the life of me, I don't know how to implement the page range restriction. I've tried using the PrintPageRange option in the hyperref package, but that only  sets the page range statically once and for all for the whole document. If I could somehow set this dynamically, that would be awesome. But I'm open to any other solution that can accomplish the desiderata.

Thanks a lot,
Bernhard.

No not as far as I know. When a glyph is missing you get whatever 
the font provides for a ".notdef" glyph. This can be a space, 
nothing, or a special glyph. It is up to you to ensure that you use 
only glyphs present in the font. (In theory it is possible to test 
if a glyph exists in a font, but this is useful only if you need 
such a test only in a small number of cases.) 

Things are probably different in luatex. There it is perhaps 
possible to build a virtual font which combines glyphs from two font 
on-the-fly.

There are plenty of fonts in the public domain which are incomplete.
Most of them were designed for company logos and the like.  There are
many fonts which provide uppercase letters only.  Most of these fonts
are lacking numbers and punctuation marks.

These fonts are quite useless in general, except if you use them for
what they are designed for.  Some of them can be used for headlines,
for instance.

Maybe because it looks different. ;)

I suppose that XeTeX supports virtual fonts because it's an extension
of Knuth's TeX.  Creating a virtual font requires at least that you
are halfways familiar with fontinst.  I'm wondering whether it's
really worth the effort in this case.

Sure.  It's a bit inconvenient but much more robust than active
characters.

You already said in another mail, that an active comma can cause
trouble when used in comma-separated lists.  I can imagine that an
active decimal point can cause trouble too.  Active characters are
always a potential cause of trouble and should be handled with care,
or better be avoided if possible.  I remember the trouble I had with
german.sty and px/tx fonts.  german.sty makes `\" active and the font
packages used hexadecimal numbers in TeX's "xy notation (babel is much
smarter in this respect).

I can imagine another solution, which is absolutely bomb-proof in
respect of TeX's macro processing: If only the comma and the period
are missing, why not add them to the font?  The solution I have in
mind is FontForge.

Creation of new glyphs requires a lot of experience and is better done
by experienced font designers.  A period, however, is either a circle
or a square, and it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to create one.
You don't have to be a font designer in order to draw a circle or a
square.  The comma might be more difficult.  It's probably difficult
to draw a Computer Modern like comma (a circle with a tail) but maybe
it's sufficient to approximate it by a polygon.

I can't claim that I've any experience with FontForge, I just used it
recently in order to modify some glyphs.  But when I saved the
modified font (a .pfb file), I was quite surprised that FontForge
automatically created all the files necessary in order to use the font
with TeX immediately.

I think that creating a virtual font is too much work and not worth
the effort.  It's probably a reasonable solution for people who are
familiar with fontinst already.  Active characters are problematic and
macros are inconvenient.  Maybe FontForge is the most straightforward
approach.  It's bullet-proof, at least.

Regards,
  Reinhard
