I would advice you to join the MacOSX-TeX mailing list:

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

and tell there how did you install TeX (MacTeX, TeXLive...?) and if you upgraded your OS recently (Leopard --> Snow Leopard).


Best,

Dear TUG,
I was answering a question I saw on TeXhax by a student who wanted to know how to use MLA style. So I sent him a sample file that compiles on my computer, with all the trimmings (my bibliography database, and so on). He couldn't compile it. It turns out that he was using a different file named mla.sty, one that messes up the ones most people use.

His file came from http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mla-paper/
This is a wierd package designed to produce something like MLA style for student papers, but not to require BibTeX. (I think the authors have mistaken ideas about what MLA style is, too, but that's another matter.)

But the one that really does give you MLA style, and works with BibTeX is found at:
biblio/bibtex/contrib/mla/mla.sty

I'm a little worried that people who use programs like MikTeX, which go to CTAN to find style files not already on their system, will be picking up the wrong mla.sty file.

I thought I'd bring this to your attention.

with best wishes
John Burt

Hello,
I read http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=noans+newans?.

However, I have used multibib to separately use two bibliographies(simple code is given below).
Well, it works?without having any link of the cited?number/alpha to the bib entity on the pdf text.
I wish to have a link between the produced?number/alpha and the corresponding bib entity on the pdf text so that if I click on the cited number/alpha on the pdf text then it directly indicates to the corresponding bib entity.

Thanking,
Sharif

Subject: [texhax] AtBeginDocument in beamer
Message-ID: <4BB64535.90401@gmx.de>

Hi all!

I?m having some trouble using the beamer class and trying to set frames
\AtBeginDocument. A minimal example

\documentclass[]{beamer}

\AtBeginDocument{\frame{test1}}
\begin{document}
\frame{test2}
\end{document}

already shows first problems: The navigation symbols are totally wrong
(at the top of test1, at the bottom of test2).
Ok, in my document I don?t make use of these symbols, but I have some
other effects:

? the footline goes anywhere, but not at the bottom. can be corrected by
using \vspace*
? the headline leaves about 4mm of blank space above it which cannot be
corrected by \vspaces
? \inserttotalframenumber prints just 1 instead of the actual number

The beamer documentation says

? The height of the headline and footline templates is calculated
automatically. This is done by typesetting the templates and then
?having a look? at their heights. This recalculation is done right at
the beginning of the document, after all packages have been loaded and
even after these have executed their \AtBeginDocument initialization.

So I guess I cannot use \AtBeginDocument to print \frames. Does anybody
have an advise how to handle this? I need AtBeginDocument as the first
two frames are generated half-automatically. Is there any internal
feature I can use (which is stable enough to really use it?) or hack it
myself anyhow? I could try to use \AtBeginSection instead but then I?d
have to insert a \section by hand which is useless.

I?d be thankfull for any suggestions,
cheers
Arno

I'm making a wild guess: Doesn't beamer provide a way to mark a frame as 
fragile and, if so, might that be needed here?

Well I don't know why you can insert
\AtBegindocument{..}\begin{document} in your half-automatically
generated document but not \begin{document}.... But anyway, you can
probably use the hook beamer use for "last minutes additions":

\documentclass[]{beamer}
\makeatletter
\g at addto@macro\beamer at lastminutepatches{\frame{test1}}
\makeatother
\begin{document}
\frame{test2}
\end{document}

The way might be to find out where and in which your packets the \thefigure command is redefined and change it there. No simple way.

But when I read the description in the packet endfloat, it mentions that there is a file 
*.fff created with the entries for the endfloat. Is there any way to put changes in this file by hand?

It also mentions that there was a version with a bug (version 2.2 ?). Are you sure that your version is not the bugged one?

And of course the 'nolists' option "does not" create some list!

Also there is a much overseen fact that the right numbers  
in floats like figures are normally created by the captions,
not by \begin{figure} or \begin{table}. 
Your label should be placed after the \caption. If there is no \caption, other ways must be used to keep the counting (e.g. like \refstepcounter{figure} before a \label).
This might be the case for your work, if I interpret your description below right. 
There is no way for a figure number like 2.0 (but which might well mean a figure in chapter/section 2 with with the label at the wrong place).   

There is a lot more written in the manual (endfloat.dtx), but for
this more detailed work knowledge (who wants what and how it is done???) is needed.

Further there seems to be a problem with rotated figures (or tables).

At the end it might be easier to write this part by hand? I do not know.

rotating figures.

This morning I noticed that bookmarks stopped to be clickable. Little
experiments show that  bookmark (2010/04/03 v1.10) is faulty:

\documentclass[12t]{article}
\usepackage{bookmark}

\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}

\section{One}

\newpage

\section{Two}
\end{document}

Commenting it out resolves the problem albeit for me generates an error


l.147 \bookmarksetup

in

\backmatter
\bookmarksetup{startatroot}
\printindex%{book_new.idx}

The previous two lines should suffice, I have looked at the LaTeX 
definitions again.
If they didn't with Jesus Guillermo Andrade, it is still a mystery to me, 
needing more analysis.

The following two lines are useful as a general redefinition of \@listi and 
\@listI in the document preamble only, I think, not as part of an 
environment definition. This addressed Jesus Guillermo Andrade's desire not 
to have any extra vertical spaces.

Message-ID: <n2xa5c3d8351004040441icf42240aw434150e6fe1c3535@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I'm trying to streamline my workflow a little.  Since I work in the
humanities, many of my footnotes, which are frequent, are fairly
extensive.  This tends to disrupt the flow of the document on the
screen and makes editing the text itself harder.  One solution I'm
considering is putting all of the footnotes in a separate file (or
perhaps at the end of the main file).  What envisage is having
something like:

This is some text.\fn{5}

in one file, and then having

\deffn{5}{This is the footnote text}

in another file.

Is there already a package to do something similar? What would be the
most robust way to go about something like this?

Any advice appreciated!

Best wishes,

Nicholas

I don't know of any package, but I would recommend
that you avoid hard-coding numbers if possible, so
as to permit easy revision of the text.  Perhaps
something more like

	This is some text.\fn {} This is some more text.\fn {}

in the main file and

	\newfootnote {text for first footnote}
	\newfootnote {text for second footnote}

in your footnotes file.  It would not be difficult to
write code to support this.

I see your point - I should have been clear that those numbers were
intended merely as labels, not as hard-coded footnote numbers.  A
label is necessary so that I can move text around without worrying
that footnotes will come out of sequence.

But I'm still nervous about the right way to go about this....

Dear Phil,

That is a very kind offer indeed.  I'm using LaTeX, but my
understanding is that TeX macros would work.  And in any case, if you
could show me how to do it in TeX it might in any case help me grapple
with a  LaTeX-friendly version.

Best wishes,

N.

Nick:

Since you are using LaTeX, it's really quite simple.  I use

\footnote{\input{footnoteNAME.tex}\label{'footnoteNAME'}}

and then the file footnoteNAME.tex contains the footnote contents.

This allows me to list the footnotes at the end of the paper:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf On page~\pageref{'footnoteNAME'}:}   \\ \input{footnoteNAME.tex}
...
\end{enumerate}

Not sure I follow this, Tom : does "footnoteNAME.tex"
contain one or all footnotes ?  In Nicholas's original
enquiry, it seemed to me that he wanted to hold all
footnotes in a single file.

OK, here's a first attempt -- no guarantees, but
it seems to work for my trivial test case !

[Master source]

\let \Footnote = \footnote
\newcount \footnotecount
\def \footnote #1%
     {%

         \global \advance \footnotecount by 1
         \Footnote {$^\the \footnotecount$}{\csname footnote:#1\endcsname}%
     }
\input footnotes

This is some text \footnote {1}; this is some more text
\footnote {3}; this is the final stretch of text \footnote {2}.
\end

[Footnotes.tex]

\newcount \footnotecounter
\def \newfootnote #1%
     {%
         \global \advance \footnotecounter by 1
         \expandafter \def \csname footnote:\the \footnotecounter \endcsname {#1}
     }

\newfootnote {This is the footnote text for footnote 1}
\newfootnote {This is the footnote text for footnote 2}
\newfootnote {This is the footnote text for footnote 3}

Right.  In the paper I'm writing each footnote is in a separate file. 
However if one joins them into one file, then there must be a way to
separate them in the paper.  One could:

\input{myfootnotes}

near the start of the paper and myfootnotes.tex would contain

\newcommand{\footnoteA}[1]{\footnote{A anything} }
\newcommand{\footnoteB}[1]{\footnote{B building} }
\newcommand{\footnoteC}[1]{\footnote{C castle} }
\newcommand{\footnoteD}[1]{\footnote{D domain} }

so later in the paper one would\footnoteA\ and so on.

I tried this and it worked.

Wouldn't it be better to just use an editor w/ code-folding support?

Or LyX?

Most folding is designed for hiding sections of computer code.  But
you are right that this would be ideal in some ways.  There is a patch
for vim that will let it hide code within a line, as well as (as is
usual) whole lines, but it is quite a pain to get working properly.  I
thought that a LaTeX solution might provide a more portable solution.

I haven't looked at LyX option because of other packages I often have to use.

Brackets are all that I need to draw.  Can I download the program and,

To use code folding in vim you don't have to apply any patches. You
could just use foldmarkers to get what you want.

[Example.tex]
text text text \footnote
% [[[
{The text of the footnote.}
% ]]]
text continues here.
eof.

Just put this at the end of your file to activate the appropriate
folding method:
% vim: set foldmethod=marker foldmarker=[[[,]]]: 

See
:help foldmethod
:help foldmarker

You can open the folds with zo, and close them with zc in normal mode.
See :help fold for more details.

Hope it is not impolite to suggest a non-Tex solution on the list :)

Cheers,
	Kai.

Subject: [texhax] how to copy a file within eTeX?
Message-ID: <4BBA6B08.5020205@gmail.com>

My problem:

I need to process a single ToC file multiple times within the course of
compiling a single TeX file. However, since I'm also regenerating the ToC,
I can't simply put the usual \readtoc at the points where I want the ToC
processing to occur.

My guess at a reasonable solution:

Actually, I had two approaches:

1. Read the contents of the ToC file into a single variable, then execute
the variable as if it were a macro at each to the points where I want a ToC.

2. Copy the \jobname.toc  file to \jobname.mytoc, and then execute a
slightly modified version of \readtocfile (modified to read from
\jobname.mytoc) at the places where I want the ToC.

I can't get either of these to work, not because they are intrinsically
wrong (although they may be) but simply because I can't figure out how to
implement either of them. I've spent the last hour poring over the TeXbook
and "TeX for the Impatient" and trying things, but not really getting very
far :-(

In particular I thought that #2 would be essentially trivial (by --
horribly -- reading and writing a line at a time), but I don't see how to
tell when I've reached the end of the source file. The discussions of \read
and descriptions of file I/O don't seem to explain that anywhere.

Any help much appreciated (as always).

  Doc

PS I *almost* considered simply copying the file in the shell before I run
TeX but that seemed defeatist.

Well actually the contents of .toc aren't  written directly when
e.g. a \section command is encountered. This wouldn't work if the
\tableofcontents command isn't the first thing in a document like
here:
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
\section{A}
\tableofcontents
\section{B}
\end{document}

What really happens is that a \addtocontents command first writes a
\@writefile command in the aux-file, and at \end{document} the
aux-file is input and then all entries are written in one go to the
toc.

The reason that you can't normally use two \tableofcontents command
is that \jobename.toc is already opened for writing by the first
\tableofcontents command. The memoir class moves the opening of
\jobname.toc to the end of document and so allows two (or more)
\tableofcontents commands. You could copy this method:

\documentclass{article}
\makeatletter
\renewcommand{\@starttoc}[1]{%
  \begingroup\makeatletter
    \@input{\jobname.#1}%
    \if at filesw
      \AtEndDocument{%
        \expandafter\newwrite\csname tf@#1\endcsname
        \immediate\openout \csname tf@#1\endcsname \jobname.#1\relax
      }%
    \fi
  \@nobreakfalse
  \endgroup}
\makeatother
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}
\tableofcontents
\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}
\tableofcontents

\section{A}
\subsection{b}
\subsubsection{c}
\section{B}
\end{document}

Hi Doc,
while you are reading a file you have to set \endlinechar=-1, then you
can can find the end of the file with \ifeof.  \read appends an empty
line to the file and unless \endlinechar=-1, \ifeof doesn't recognize
the end of the file.

Example (not tested):

\newread\InputFile
\openin\InputFile=myfile.tex
\endlinechar=-1

\def\recurse{
  \ifeof\InputFile\else
  \read\InputFile to \buffer
  %% do something with \buffer
  \expandafter\recurse\fi}

\recurse

\endlinechar=13
\closein\InputFile

You can also set \endlinechar=-1 directly in front of \read and
restore it immediately after you've read a particular line.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Another way of folding them into one file would be to use the filecontents
package with the filecontents environment to put all those different files
into one big file without changing anything else.

Just a thought,

this question is difficult to answer without knowing you and without
knowing linguistics well enough for a guess what you could mean with
'brackets'.

If you want to download and install LaTeX, start with
http://tug.org/begin.html -- you should find the install version easy
enough (look out for texlive).

For someone used to some kind of programming, LaTeX is easy to use once you
figure out some basic concepts. Especially it helps greatly if you find a
template which fits to your needs as a starting point.

LaTeX itself is not at all of the "what you see is what you get" approach.
Quite contrary, you tell LaTeX what you want to have and it then uses a
master typesetter's knowledge on how that is exactly to be typeset. There
are some programs that provide the user with a more WYSIWYG work
environment, but I do not have any experience with that. Maybe someone else
can advise you on those.

If I guess right about those 'brackets' -- if you search for the
comprehensive LaTeX symbol list (symbols-a4.pdf), among the first tables
are some phonetic symbol lists and the corresponding commands for use with
LaTeX.

Hope that helps at least a bit,

	Susan

There are several LaTeX-distributions that are easy to download and 
install:

It is easy to scale them, if that is what you are asking?

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
$
   [ \big[ \Big[ \bigg[ \Bigg[ \Bigg] \bigg] \Big] \big] ]
$
\end{document}

What kind of document preparation system can not handle [ and ]?

Guessing from Wikipedia on "brackets", simply "angle brackets" for 
orthography are needed. With (La)TeX, they are $\langle$ $\rangle$. You 
should find them with office programs as well, as some special math 
symbols. I am not referring to $<$ $>$ that sometimes are used as 
substitutes (maybe because of ignorance). With an office program, perhaps 
you can invoke angle brackets with the "formula editor" from the delimiters 
menu (inserting formulas consisting of angle brackets only). More generally 
on LaTeX for linguistics:

Serendipity is a wonderful thing.

Thank you. It's even easier to download a macro than to implement
Reinhard's suggestion of yesterday (which I was going to implement later
today; now it looks like I won't have to; wonderful!)

Thank you kindly.

Dear Sir,
I am PhD student in Physics in Algeria and I'd like to type the manuscript of my thesis, my reports and articles in Latex format. It's really top.
Unfortunately, here at home, this software is unobtainable, and I can not download and install it because the internet connection at home is very low.
Please Sir, can you send me the DVD TeX Collection 2009 (http://www.tug.org/texcollection/texcollection2009-large.png) which includes the french version of Tex Live 2009 for Windows vista and Linux.
I wish to inform you, Sir, that my reasons do not allow me to buy it.
Thank you in advance,
Best regards,

So we see what you need on

     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-driven_phrase_structure_grammar

(in my view) different kinds of diagrams are in the German version

     http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-driven_Phrase_Structure_Grammar

(You must not assume that linguists read this mailing list.)

I don't know if this can be achieved with Word. Even with TeX it is not 
very easy for me right now. There may be special packages for this at

     http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#misctables

especially bigdelim or delarray. A special HPSG package may be valuable, 
but I can't find any and ... LingTrees seems to have some HPSG 
functionality (p. 14):

     http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/LingTrees/lingtrees.doc.pdf

as well as xyling (p. 19):

     ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/xyling/xyli-doc.pdf

That special "bracket" notation seems to be implemented by avm.sty 
(attribute-value matrices) seemingly belonging to the LingTrees bundle. I 
can't find its original documentation avm-doc, but in searching I found 
this overview by Christina Thiele in a TUGboat from 1995

     http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb16-1/tb46ling.pdf

maybe someone else finds something more recent like this.

"Today, Oran is a major port and a commercial centre, and has three

And none of these universities (where I assume you study) has a fast
enough connection for the internet install of TL?

First, please see

which got a reply from Robin Laakso.

Also, with ``...here AT HOME, this software is unobtainable...'' I don't think the OP means in his house, but in his home town, so Martin's advice seems valid to me.

OK, I've read that correspondence, but it ended with Robin
suggesting downloading, which according to M. TOUIL is not
an option because of the slowness of his connection.

 > Also, with ``...here AT HOME, this software is unobtainable...''

But M. TOUIL has already said, quite clearly, that "the internet connection
at home is very [s]low"; surely M. TOUIL is far better placed than Martin
to judge whether or not his connection is sufficiently fast to allow
him to download the software.

But aside from all this, the TeX community exists primarily to help
each other, rather than to make (arguably well meant) suggestions
that in the end lead nowhere.  In 1986, I received my first copy
of TeX as a gift from a friend (Peter Jackson), who copied his copy
onto 9-track tape and gave me the copy.  If M. TOUIL would like to
send me his address, I will be more than happy to copy my TeX
Collection 2009 DVD and send a copy to him.

Sure, but the network installer allows you to download only the
packages you actually need.  If you are not a macro programmer, you
don't need the sources.  And unless you speak Chinese, Japanese, or
Korean, you don't need the CJK package, and so on.  TeX Live supports
zillions of languages.  You can disable language supoprt for all
languages you don't understand.

I'm sure that you can install a customized TeX Live within less than
two hours even with your slow internet line.

Becoming a member of a TeX user group is always a good idea.  But
please keep in mind that this is often unaffordable.  I was twice in
Vietnam and I know that for Vietnamese a TUG membership is extremely
expensive.

The solution to HPSG's AVMs is indeed, avm.sty, although it has kind of 
disappeared as such on CTAN.
The AVMs in the German Wikipedia aren't different, simply less well made 
(at least I'm more used to the English version).
And I'm sorry I mistakenly made an answer to Marcia directly some days 
ago, instead of to the list, which is why there's a kind of double 
conversation. I think AVMs in Word will be extraordinarily painful, but 
learning TeX is painful too :)

By accident, I have found

(via tug.org/interest.html) -- tutorials for LaTeX for linguists.

     http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/external/clmt/latex4ling/avms/

especially addresses attribute-value matrices.

I apologize if I am sending this incorrectly, but I am replying to the
message at
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2010-March/014517.html

It seems that the original advice provided doesn't quite stay within APA the
guidelines.  I think if you instead add two lines of code on lines on line
996 which looks like

      format.bvolume output
      format.chapter.pages "chapter and pages" output.check

to

new.block

format.in.ed.booktitle output.nonnull

format.bvolume output

format.chapter.pages "chapter and pages" output.check


This seems to fix the problem that I was having with the editor and book
title not appearing correctly.

Dear, I wish to aid with the latex




          My wheel TexxnicCenter files I write perfectly generating
pdf, but I can not get ANY tex file (I did not write) and rotate
pdf, I open a file but I'm told at compile time appears a
brand message: Hear an error opening this document, this file can not be
found. The strange thing is that files written by me do not have this
problem,
I can compile. If you can help me with this question, I submit my
definitions of
output profiles (see the print TeXnicCenter). Using MikTeX 2.8.
          Another problem I face is that the packages installed beamer, and
xcolor
pgf, but I am not able to generate any document (documents that I
write and what I get). If you can help me I appreciate. (See print)


I thank the attention, Felipe.

Message-ID: <x2vb5215f01004092211z2bc274f6v732679566db0e4a1@mail.gmail.com>

I ask my question as an example

I can say \hbox to 10pt{This is a test.}

Now I want to define the macro \hboxR, so that when I say

\hboxR to 10pt{This is a test.}

it actually means

\hbox to 10pt{\beginR This is a test\endR}

Can \hboxR be defined like what I described?

Thanks

Thanks but this is not quite what I was looking for. The length (i.e. pt)
should be variable and in addition "to" also should be variable, as an
example \hboxR spread 5pt{This is a test}

So it can take 3 arguments, which the first two can be optional.

For example, I want to define one single \hboxR amcro, such that with that
definition I can have

\hboxR{This is a test.}

\hboxR to 10cm{This is a test}

\hboxR to 3pt{This is a test.}

\hboxR spread 5pt{This is a test.}

\hboxR spread 6cm{This is a test.}

I saw this kind of definition in a package and tried to understand what
it does (to change \textcolor a bit) ? but I just didn?t get the meaning
of it. Could you explain shortly what the effect of #1# is? ?

Probably not with full generality.  The following is a partial solution with several issues:

\TeXXeTstate=1
\def\hboxR#1#{\hboxRR{#1}}
\def\hboxRR#1#2{\hbox#1{\beginR#2\endR}}
\setbox0=\hboxR to 40pt{abc\hfil def}

With this definition, \hboxR can presumably act as a <box>, and the syntax is similar to \hbox.  However, no braces must occur in the "to" part, and the braces enclosing the box contents must be explicit.

A final # in the parameter text of a definition stands for a left brace.
So \def\foo#1#{...} means that the first argument is delimited by a left 
brace, hence it's "abc" in the following call:
\foo abc{...}
Note that this delimiter is not absorbed as delimiters normally are, 
i.e. TeX still reads a left brace once it has found the argument.
As remarked by Philipp, the weakness of the solution here is that boxes 
can be opened by an implicit \bgroup instead of {, which is not possible 
anymore with \hboxR.

Ah ? I see. Now I understand many things way better ?
Thanks a lot for this!

Is not there a way that this \hboxR can accept \bgroup and \egroup? i.e.
\hboxR\bgroup This is a test\egroup

A little hack on Wolfgang's solution to allow space after the box 
specification:

\def\dohboxR
  {\ifx\next\bgroup
     \expandafter\dodohboxR
   \else
     \ifcat\noexpand\next\spacechar
       \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\removespace
     \else
       \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\nodohboxR
     \fi
   \fi}
{\def\:{\global\let\spacechar= }\: }
% There's already such an implicit space in all formats, I believe, but 
let's play safe.
\def\removespace{%
  \afterassignment\getchar\let\killspace=
% The previous line doesn't end with % on purpose!
  }
\def\getchar{\futurelet\next\dohboxR}

Wolfgang's code for the box material is troublesome if \endR has to 
retrieve values locally set in that material; however I can't see 
another solution. We can't use a \toks to store the material, since it 
should be closed by an explicit "}", whereas  the box can be closed by 
\egroup. Looping over the material and adding it character by character 
in a macro or token list until we find an \egroup or "}" won't do if for 
instance we stumble upon "\def\foo{...}", because we won't be able to 
add the braces... unless we use e-TeX, whose "default-engine-ness" 
should probably be taken for granted now, but that's another matter.

I can't understand why you make everything happen inside a group, 
Wolfgang. Is that because you use \toks0 as a scratch? Then wouldn't it 
simpler to use our own token list and remove the group?

Best,
Paul

To add to the other solutions... this one only defines one
macro and works with both { } and \bgroup \egroup...

\def\hboxR{\begingroup
 \everyhbox{%
   \aftergroup\endgroup
   \everyhbox{}%
   \beginR
   \bgroup
   \aftergroup\endR
   \aftergroup\egroup
 }\hbox}

I wanted just something simple without too many extra defintions.

Thanks Donald and others. This has been very helpful for me. I actually like
Donald's solution better. I have got one more questions and that is it. I
also need to implement another primitive like command \halignR such that
when I say

\halignR to 2pt{#1}

It actually will mean

\hbox\bgroup\beginR\vbox\
bgroup\halign to 2pt{#1}\egroup\endR\egroup

so again \halignR accepts both {} and \bgroup \egroup. I have tried to
implement this with using your solutions but I only could do it when it
actually accepts {} and not \bgroup \egroup.

Thanks

\box0

Would not work here, because TeX expects a box. How can one fix this?

That is impossible: To use it as a <box>, the macro has to be expandable, thus all suggestions posted here (except mine, which requires explicit braces) don't work because they use assignments.

The following is a hack that might or might not work in your situation:

\TeXXeTstate=1
\def\hboxR{\hhboxR{}}
\def\hhboxR#1#2{%
  \hhhboxR{#1}#2\nil
}
\def\firstofthree#1#2#3{#1}
\def\secondofthree#1#2#3{#2}
\def\thirdofthree#1#2#3{#3}
\def\hhhboxR#1#2#3\nil{
  \ifx&#3&%
    \ifx#2\bgroup
      \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\firstofthree
    \else
      \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\secondofthree
    \fi
  \else
    \expandafter\thirdofthree
  \fi
  {\hhhhboxR{#1}}%
  {\hhboxR{#1#2}}%
  {\hhhhhboxR{#1}{#2#3}}%
}
\def\hhhhboxR#1#2\egroup{%
  \hhhhhboxR{#1}{#2}%
}
\def\hhhhhboxR#1#2{%
  \hbox#1{\beginR#2\endR}%
}
\setbox0=\hboxR to 35pt \bgroup abc\hfil def\egroup
\box0
\bye

Issues: Significant spaces are gobbled, braces must be either both explicit or both implicit, only \bgroup...\egroup is allowed (no other implicit brace tokens), the contents are read as a macro argument, preventing interesting applications like opening and closing the box in different macros.
Maybe you want to abandon the idea of simulating the box primitives and use a different syntax (like LaTeX's \sbox and lrbox) instead.

Yes, but I've recently turned into an advocate of the idea that you 
should avoid format-dependent macros (except perhaps plain's) as much as 
possible.

No I can't :) The brace problem is indeed easily solved with e-TeX (add 
a brace with catcode 12 then use \scantokens to read everything anew), 
but, beside other problems, the scanning approach is flawed from the 
start, since one should be able to say:

\def\foo{\bgroup foo\egroup}
\hbox\foo

and scanning that will get everything wrong. So only Donald's approach 
works, and it suffers from the same group hack as yours, so I guess we 
can't do better (but after all I'm just a wizard's apprentice, and I 
hope I'll be proven wrong by a master). Not to mention the impossibility 
of using \hboxR in a assignment, as remarked by Philipp.

That's what I'd thought, just wanted to be sure.

Or we need a new primitive: \everyendofbox. Anybody from the LuaTeX team 
around here? (It's very likely you can do it in Lua even without a 
primitive.)

Subject: [texhax] Incorrect Chapter Labels
Message-ID: <20100412001958.226.qmail@ssr.com>

I have a large book (175+ pages) and need to provide the complete book
as well as each chapter in PDF files.

I have been following the directions in the TeX faq for using include
and includeonly to generate these files. I have main files for each
chapter

{preamble}

\includeonly{chapter1}

\begin{document}
\include{chapter1}
\include{chapter2}

etc

\end{document

and a main file which produces the entire book, which doesn't have
\theincludeonly directive. This is the only difference between the
driver files.

The chapter files are in a subdirectory called TeX.

While this appears to work, I noticed that the chapter references are
incorrect in the individual files (although they are correct in the
full book).

Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong, or suggest a fix?

Thank you,
Scott

This is the source of the problem ---references are kept in the *.aux files. You have to use *only one* master file:

\includeonly{%
chapter1,%
chapter2,%
chapter3,%
<etc.>
}%

Now run at least twice this master file; then, to get only chapter 1, for example,

\includeonly{%
chapter1,%
%chapter2,%
%chapter3,%
%<etc.>
}%

and so on.


Best,

Axel

You could use tools like pdftk. With the help of it you could select
desired pages from whole book (I assume that you have your book in PDF
format) and put them into separated file. See manual for details.

You will have: corrent chapter and pages numbering.

P.S. This process could be programmed (without need to find out on which
page this particular chapter begins and on with it ends) I think.

Indeed a big shortcoming.

One solution is to use another layer of \hbox{ } instead of 
\begingroup \endgroup

 \def\hboxR{\hbox\bgroup
  \everyhbox{%
   \aftergroup\egroup
   \everyhbox{}%
    \beginR
   \bgroup
   \aftergroup\endR
   \aftergroup\egroup
  }\hbox}

There is still the problem that \hboxR is an expandable macro
instead of a primitive.  Since \beginR indicates that you
have etex enabled, use 

\protected\def\hboxR...

What is your expected output? Looks quite normal and expected to me.
The baseline of the minipage is at the last line as you can see if
you add an x outside the minipage:

\documentclass{article}

I think the problem is rather the read direction. If I understand the OP's
code correctly, he means to have *all* the minipage outputs in left to
right direction. Somehow the [b] variant ignores left-to-right being chosen
(after the surrounding should choose right-to-left) whereas the other two
don't.

Unfortunately I'm far from understanding the code well enough for an
answer...

The expected output should be that all lists be LTR but the list in the last
minipage with postion "b" is not. I could fix this if instead list, there
was ordinary text, but with lists, I am puzzled what to do.

This is something I have never seen with LaTex before.  If you look at

Line-1 has no descenders; \baselineskip is inadequate
and TeX is having to fall back on \lineskip.

You should increase \baselineskip to match \Huge.

Caveat emptor : the terminology used herein is Plain TeX;
LaTeX probably has other terms for these concepts.

Hi Tom,

The odd look has something to do with the fact that there are no descenders in the first line.

Change

Dear

to 

Deary

and it will render looking correct.

I do not know why, but it may help to track the issue down...

    This is something I have never seen with LaTex before.  If you look at the
    .pdf file, you see that the line height for the second line (and possibly
    the first as well) is smaller than the others.  This the source:

    \documentclass[11pt,a5paper]{article}

    \usepackage{geometry}
    \geometry{a4paper,tmargin=3cm,bmargin=3cm,lmargin=2.5cm,rmargin=2cm}
    \renewcommand\familydefault{ppl}
    \begin{document}
    \Huge

    Dear brothers: I think that God has made us apostles the most abject of
    mankind.  We experience hunger and thirst, we are naked, we are roughly
    handled, and we have no fixed abode ... They curse us and we bless.  They
    persecute us and we suffer it ... They treat us as the scum of the earth,
    the dregs of humanity ... to this very day.
    \normalsize

    \end{document}

i've already seen phil taylor's message
about descenders, but the cause is more
direct than that.  (la)tex uses whatever
baseline is in effect at a paragraph
break for the previous paragraph.  and
\normalsize is part of that paragraph.

add a blank line before \normalsize.

this effect can also be seen when text
is interrupted by a math display which
is set as \small, for example

   xxx\\
   xxx
   {\small
   \[ x + y = z \]
   }
   xxx

the part of the text above the display
will have narrower baselines than what
comes after the display (unless that too
is interrupted by a size change).  it's
amazing how many authors of math papers
(or submissions to tugboat) don't notice
that.

Thanks for the responses, and I'll have to think about them.  I fail

with what I regard as the basic philosopy of LaTex.  On the other hand, 
having to add a blank line before the \normalsize (which worked very 
nicely, thank you) smacks a little of a magic wand, At least at the

Given my limited experience with LaTex (three or four years), I hardly 
dare to imply that this must be a bug.  However, given the documentation 
I have read, I am inclined to regard anything after the \Huge command as 
being formatted accordingly, regardless of descenders. Once you turn on 
that effect it remains in power, until some other command changes that 
attribute for the formatting of the text.  The fact that I would have to 
to do something  (completely illogical in my eyes) at the very END of 
that particular section to get everything right in the BEGINNING of that 
section, is in my eyes completely illogical.  And very confusing for 
users.  I have to add that my experience with programming goes back at 
least forty years.  I have generated many bugs of many different kinds.

Sorry, I regard this as strange behavior of the LaTex system.  I am 
inclined to think this is a bug.

Subject: [texhax] TeX to text?
Message-ID: <4BC4E6EE.8000403@gmx.de>

Hi all!

Writing an article for a magazine, I need to have a text-only file. The
guys want no markup at all, so I cannt send LaTeX code, for proofreading
whatsoever. But I still want to read my document as a nicely formatted
pdf. As I am quite lazy, I don?t want to write two versions, so I tought
of some TeX hackery giving me either text only or the pdf. I am doing
this with the following code in the header:

\immediate\openout13=\jobname.textonly

\let\ifREINTEXT
     \iffalse    %% change this (true/false) to toggle text/TeX

\ifREINTEXT{
  \def\TeX{TeX}
  \def\LaTeX{LaTeX}
}
\fi
\begin{document}
\ifREINTEXT\def\par{^^J}\immediate\write13{\fi


And at the end of the document

\ifREINTEXT}}\fi

That works fine and gives me everything I need. But as this doesn?t look
like the best solution I wondered wether there is a package doing this
in a nice way. If not so, would it be a good investment of time to write
one myself, i.e. does anybody know wether this would be usefull?

cheers
Arno

no, not a bug, but a knuth design

the explanation is buried in chapter 14

a paragraph inside of tex is actually a

what you're missing is that "font size" combines two concepts: the size
of the glyphs that are going to be printed, and the default spacing
between the lines of a paragraph.

tex treats these two very differently: the size is bound with the glyph
as it arrives, but the line spacing stands there as a static variable
until the paragraph is complete, and is split into lines.  (up to that
point, after all, there _are_ no lines, just a sequence of glyphs.)

now, your thing had

  \HUGE
[sets both variables]
  text of para (or whatever you call the bits of the mass)
[each character of text creates a glyph, whose size is HUGE]
  \normalsize
[sets both variables]
  \par
[actually implicit in the blank line: split the preceding paragraph into
lines, using the current value of line spacing, which is now that of
\normalsize]

if you put the \par (blank line) before \normalsize, the paragraph is
split into lines using the line spacing derived from \HUGE.

so barbara is telling you not to fiddle with blank lines, but to finish
the paragraph in the right place.  it just happens that you can
reasonably do that by fiddling with blank lines, but you shouldn't be
thinking of it that way.  (or rather, i hope you won't after reading
this...)

and, as several people remarked, you wouldn't have seen the misbehaviour
at all if the first line had had "deary" instead of "dear", because tex
doesn't allow adjacent lines to overlap, and the "y" would push the
following line down.  a person with sharp eyes might see differences
between the spacing of several lines, if they were all spaced by
descenders [i wouldn't, but i'm an old man] rather than the "correct"
value of line spacing.

> Sorry, I regard this as strange behavior of the LaTex system.  I am
> inclined to think this is a bug.

i hope the explanation helps.  it is indeed strange behaviour; but given
tex's modus operandi it's pretty much unavoidable.  and diagnosing the
problem, in code, is probably quite tricky -- too big a problem for
early latex systems to have contemplated it.

Also, that FAQ answer talks about "a couple" or "two" sentences, when I
think it means just one: staring at "Here's text..." and ending with "the
group."

>> no, not a bug, but a knuth design

And hence, as ever, somewhat unintuitive 
(unless you want to look as deeply as Knuth 
and Robin into the use of text as a sequence 
of commands and the power of the empty line!).

But then putting \Huge anywhere into a text 
stream is also, these days, bizarre and unusual 
punishment (of text and intuition).
 
But it all made sense 30 years ago so don't
worry about it ...except that it is likely 
to last 50 or more years ... says the oracle!

Have fun,  chris

If I may add my own point of view, what we're talking about here is 
neither a bug nor unintuitive. It just reminds us that TeX is not simply 
a programming language (if it is one at all) but a typographic device, 
which implies some assumptions. Baseline distances are meaningless 
unless they're related to paragraph building: a single line has no 
baseline distance. So it is normal that \normalsize influence the whole 
paragraph, it wouldn't make sense otherwise.

Now, Tom, that something at the END influences the BEGINNING of anything 
is the basic philosophy of TeX, and once again it has to do with 
typography. A typeset text is not a sequence of events, where what has 
happened before can't be modified afterward; a typeset text is more like 
a picture in which the balance of things depends on slight details. 
Thus, although we type paragraphs token after token, TeX tries to get 
the big picture, and that's why we're using it! This might be "very 
confusing for users", but then TeX users should be aware that they're 
doing typography here, and that programming in TeX is meant to serve 
that goal.

OK.  Clearly I have to retract what I said about a possible bug, given 
the responses from obviously knowledgeable  persons.  Nevertheless, I 
still regard the behavior as strange, and I have to mull over the

To gain a better feeling for what is happening (and why it is
happening), you might like to process the two following
examples, which use the sequence \scriptsize, \footnotesize,
\small, \normalsize, \large, \Large, \LARGE, \huge,
in forward and reverse order within two paragraphs.  You will,
I hope, see that the size command is honoured at the point of
occurrence for the font, but only the last size command is
honoured when computing \baselineskip for the entire paragraph.

My thanks to Barbara for pointing out that I had failed to
notice the trailing \normalsize in your original example.

Dear all,

I've stumbled on the following problem. Heiko Oberdiek uses

\expandafter\ifx\csname ProvidesPackage\endcsname\relax

in his ifluatex package, whereas Till Tantau in PGF/TikZ goes

\ifx\ProvidesPackage\@undefined

so that, if you load the former before the latter, the latter goes 
wrong, since \ProvidesPackage is not undefined anymore.
Shouldn't we try to all use the same construction to test for the 
existence of commands?
If we took e-TeX for granted, then \ifcsname would solve the problem. 
Otherwise, we could try to have a rule according to which we should 
always use one way of testing and not the other. Is that unrealistic?

Best,
Paul

Subject: [texhax] Problems between section and hyperref package
Message-ID: <op.va5jj7txtpjj8f@lpr>

Hello all,

has anybody solved how to use "section" and "hyperref" packages together?

It seems they are not fully compatible; maybe a hack must be used.

I use "section" package as I need to change how sections look.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to restore hyperref "jumping" in the document as I cannot use "hyperref" package.

I tried to include "section" and "hyperref" after, then "hyperref" first followed by "section"; none of these cases worked well.

Any ideas how to make it work?

Thank you in advance.

Regards,

Lukas

However, this is done in such a way that \ProvidesPackage does not get 
defined. For example, if you try

\input ifluatex.sty
\show\ProvidesPackage
\bye

you will see that \ProvidesPackage remains safely undefined. Can you 
provide a full example showing the problem?

Hi Arno,
here are my quick thoughts
1. there are plenty tex2text converters of different ages, technology, 
authors and status...
2. latex2html... there are even more html2txt converter....
3. many pdf-reader can export to txt...
4. A very different but my most favourite way: Use emacs+org-mode.
    org-mode allows you to outline, organize and write your text 
without any LaTeX. This text can be finally exported to LaTeX, HTML oder 
simple Text. org-mode uses a very simple wiki like markup, is very nice 
with huge feature set to organize your work (the original task of 
org-mode) and it is all you need if you have not to rely heavily on 
LaTeX functions. Thus, if you use emacs already give org-mode a try...

Just my two cents

A remark from a Tex 101 user:

If we use

\Huge {Dear brothers: I think that God has made us apostles the most  
abject of mankind.  We experience hunger and thirst, we are naked, we  
are roughly handled, and we have no fixed abode ... They curse us and  
we bless.  They persecute us and we suffer it ... They treat us as the  
scum of the earth, the dregs of humanity ... to this very day.}
\normalsize


the problem exists and disappears after insertion of a blank line  
before '\normalsize' .


But, if we use

{\Huge {Dear brothers: I think that God has made us apostles the most  
abject of mankind.  We experience hunger and thirst, we are naked, we  
are roughly handled, and we have no fixed abode ... They curse us and  
we bless.  They persecute us and we suffer it ... They treat us as the  
scum of the earth, the dregs of humanity ... to this very day.}}
\normalsize

the problem exists and is *not* repaired after the insertion of a  
blank line in the same spot. (Same with the inner pair of braces  
removed.)

I wonder if that is helpful -- I wouldn't know.


Iraj.

section.sty is last date-stamped 1994, so it dates from the pre-hyperref
era.

such old packages (i was recently asked about one of mine) often fail to
work with hyperref -- looks like section.sty is one of them too.

however, you're not stuck with section.sty;

  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=secthead

lists other options; i would recommend using titlesec.sty, nowadays.  (i
would be pleased to hear of better alternatives -- it's a part of the
faq that is overdue for revision.)

You just have to add the blank line at the right place - that is: BEFORE
you close the outer braces :-) 
My explanation:
{\Huge ... }
limits the size-changing by "\Huge" to the text in the braces.
After the closing braces, you implicitly change back to "\normalsize"
(it is NOT necessary to add \normalsize explicitely in this situation).
Thus, also if you write:

{\Huge {... day.}}

\normalsize

, TeX changes the font size back to "normalsize" after the "}". This is
however - as already discussed - the end of the first paragraph, which
influences \baselineskip as used in the first line...

TeX will render your text "correctly" (that is: as expected), when
writing:

{\Huge {... day.}

}

or
{\Huge {... day.}\par}

-- in these two examples I end the paragraph explicitly while the font
size is still \Huge.

Subject: [texhax] How to getnonfreefonts?
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1004140947070.4102@coral.301south.net>

Hey everyone,

Sorry to ask a question that seems to come up frequently, but the font 
system does seem to be robust against easy explanation.

I was overjoyed to see the invention of 'getnonfreefonts' as a way to 
automate the installation of some common [though undistributable] fonts. 
I seem to remember being awestruck by its simplicity of use when I used it 
in the past to install arial-urw.

However, this morning, on my up-to-date texlive system, I tried to install 
garamond with: getnonfreefonts garamond;  it went through all the 
motions, downloaded and extracted the files, ran updmap and so on, and 
completed without errors.  But when building a LaTeX document, with 
\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{ugm}, dvips outputs a lot of lines like:

mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for ugmr8r.
dvips: Font ugmr8r not found,  using cmr10 instead.

then dvips terminates with:
dvips: ! invalid char 150 from font ugmr8r

My missfont.log:
mktexpk --mfmode ljfour --bdpi 600 --mag 2+44/600 --dpi 1244 ugmr8r
mktexpk --mfmode ljfour --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600 ugmr8r
mktexpk --mfmode ljfour --bdpi 600 --mag 1+264/600 --dpi 864 ugmr8r
mktexpk --mfmode ljfour --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600 ugmri8r
mktexpk --mfmode ljfour --bdpi 600 --mag 1+120/600 --dpi 720 ugmri8r

I observed that in $HOME/texmf I have a copy of ugmr8r.tfm.  I also have 
ugm* files of type tfm, afm, pfb, map, and vf.

I tried to run getnonfreefonts-sys, using the -f option, but that didn't 
have any effect (it downloaded and installed the font again, but the 
problem persists).  Moreover, the fonts were not installed system-wide- 
they remain only in my $HOME/texmf tree.  This is all utterly mysterious 
to me.

what am I missing?

Thanks,
Brandon

Hi,

thank to all for your answers.
To make myself more clearer:
? I am using Xe/LuaTeX, so dvi is no option for me.
? I am looking for a TeX only solution. No special script or editor, it
should really be stand-alone.

Therefore:

Well, sure there are ? would have been strange if not so. But I wonder

Not exactly what I need, but I think this gets closest.

I?m not using emacs, so not an option, too.
Thanks for your suggestions, though, they helped me a lot!

Joseph has already explained why the two tests are not identical (at least in their side-effects).

In TeX there are typically many ways to produce a certain effect, either typographical or programmatic.  Sometimes the result is completely identical but soemetimes there are subtle differences that may or may not be important in context.

Thus, even if there were an Academie de TeX to lend authority to the type of decisions for uniformity of syntax or style you see as desirable, I doubt if anyone would take much notice of it.  (Just as English users never will.)

Subject: [texhax] Unexisting commands.

Dear all,

I've stumbled on the following problem. Heiko Oberdiek uses

\expandafter\ifx\csname ProvidesPackage\endcsname\relax

in his ifluatex package, whereas Till Tantau in PGF/TikZ goes

\ifx\ProvidesPackage\@undefined

so that, if you load the former before the latter, the latter goes 
wrong, since \ProvidesPackage is not undefined anymore.
Shouldn't we try to all use the same construction to test for the 
existence of commands?
If we took e-TeX for granted, then \ifcsname would solve the problem. 
Otherwise, we could try to have a rule according to which we should 
always use one way of testing and not the other. Is that unrealistic?

Best,
Paul

You should normally treat \relax as undefined, but nevertheless take care not to define control sequences with \csname. Everyone should use packages like etoolbox for these tests because they are not trivial.

Even without e-TeX, you can check for the existence of control sequences without visible side effects:

\begingroup\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\endgroup
\expandafter\ifx\csname ...\endcsname\relax ...

Should not \nameref* work as \nameref albeit without hyperlink?

I found that examples are fixed by adding \usepackage{nameref} but

1) Example 1 worked before without nameref
2) Still, without nameref package Examples should either work this way
or return errors (IMHO).

Something did go wrong at the updmap-step. The map hasn't been
enabled properly. The most frequent cause of this problem is using
sometimes updmap  and sometimes updmap-sys which leds to two sets of
map-files and dvips is using one while you are updating the other. 

Try at first your font with pdflatex: It tells you at the end of the
log-file  the path of the map file it is using. You can then compare
this path with the path given by updmap(-sys) used together with the
option --verbose. 

When it works with pdflatex but not with dvips the map-file itself
is probably faulty (dvips is more picky).

Heiko, when I found \nameref problem with memoir I decided to test it
a bit more and found not only \nameref* problem but also discrepancy
between \ref and \nameref.

In this example \ref returns theorem number but \nameref ignores
theorem and returns section name. Logically one should expect "Great
Theorem"?

Victor

\documentclass[12p]{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{nameref}
\usepackage{amsthm}
\newtheorem{theorem}{theorem}
\begin{document}
\section{One}
\label{sect-1}

\begin{theorem}[Great Theorem]\label{th-1}
$1+1=2$
\end{theorem}



\ref{th-1}

\nameref{th-1}
\end{document}

Joseph, you're right, I've spoken too hastily, the problem comes from 
luaotfload.sty (which loads ifluatex), not from ifluatex. However, the 
questions remains.
As mentionned by Chris and Robin, anybody is free to do whatever s/he 
wants, but there seems to me there isn't any kind of invitation anywhere 
to follow some rules. Actually my question was just the tip of a 
personal iceberg about the desirability of a format-independent API (and 
thus my question perhaps didn't make much sense in itself); this answers 
Philipp's point that "everyone should use packages like etoolbox," a 
good suggestion... except we have no format-independent etoolbox 
(fortunately we still have \newif and friends, which probably satisfy 
everyone, barring \outer-worshippers).

we change the \label contents after nameref, because we emulate titleref 
and thus otherwise could not get our hands on the title. So the 
\let\nameref\titleref fixed that problem

it seems the loading sequence have changed, because the memoir data is 
no longer added to the aux files with the new hyperref/nameref

we do provide a *-ed version of \titleref and perhaps nameref should 
just use that.

or perhaps it is about time we seperate the title part out of the 
labels, thus doubling the lines in the aux files (one line for the 
'normal' label, and for for 'other stuff')

this now fails

just adding a

\AtBeginDocument{\typeout{test}}

at the very end of memhfixc shows that this AtBeginDocument gets 
executed before nameref is even loaded

This also means that the

\AtBeginDocument{%
   \@ifpackageloaded{nameref}{\let\nameref\titleref}{}%
}

is never executed

Sorry for the late response.  I tested it last night myself and it
works here as expected.  Since you said thet getnonfreefonts installed
ugm.map already, this error indicates that the content of ugm.map
isn't copied to psfonts.map.  Without these entries dvips assumes that
it's a bitmap font and the mktexpk script invokes Metafont.

Installing the .map files is done in two steps.  When a particular font
is installed, the name of the .map file is added to updmap.cfg.
Finally updmap is run in order to create psfonts.map and pdftex.map by
concatenating all the .map files mentioned in updmap.cfg.

First, locate the updmap.cfg file which TeX is actually using:

kpsewhich updmap.cfg

Then check whether this file contains this entry:

Map ugm.map

If not, the first step failed.  Otherwise locate psfonts.map

kpsewhich psfonts.map

and check whether it contains:

ugmr8r GaramondNo8-Reg " TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont " <8r.enc <ugmr8a.pfb
ugmm8r GaramondNo8-Med " TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont " <8r.enc <ugmm8a.pfb

ugmmi8r GaramondNo8-MedIta " TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont " <8r.enc <ugmmi8a.pfb

If both files are ok, I can't explain the error messages you get.

You get more verbose output if you say:

getnonfreefonts --verbose --force garamond

Maybe it helps you to detect the problem.  I can't reproduce the
behavior you reported myself.

Well, you can run getnonfreefonts[-sys] with either the --help or the
--lsfonts option.  In both cases it shows you where it would install
the fonts.  getnonfreefonts installs fonts in TEXMFHOME and
getnonfreefonts-sys installs them in TEXMFLOCAL.  Definitely.

The problem is that udmap (without -sys) copies its config file to
TEXMFCONFIG and since it comes first in the search path, the file in
TEXMFSYSCONFIG is ignored.

Thus, once you run getnonfreefonts, fonts installed by
getnonfreefonts-sys are invisible to you, but other users can still
use them (unless they ran getnonfreefonts themselves before).

TeX Live developers are aware of this problem but providing a better
solution means writing updmap from scratch.  This is on the agenda but
it's still unclear when it will happen.

AFAIK, this can't happen.  getnonfreefonts calls updmap and
getnonfreefonts-sys calls updmap-sys.  A user can't do anythything
wrong.  But since Brandon ran getnonfreefonts before
getnonfreefonts-sys, I think we can ignore the -sys stuff for the time
being.  It doesn't (or shouldn't) interfere with the per-user files.

replace it with

\DeclareRobustCommand\nameref{\@ifstar{\@mem at titlerefnolink}{\@mem at titleref}}

that is how titleref is defined internally

\@mem at titlerefnolink gets redefined if hyperref is loaded

Ok, I seem to have found a solution. A functionality similar to 
afterpackage is build into memoir, so this might do the trick

If it is ok by you, I'll add this to memoir in the coming update.

First of all, after I tested with hyperref 6.80v (from tug, currently
also on CTAN and probably tomorrow on TL) both problems I reported had
gone. However still there is a behaviour, I consider as illogical
(while it is not a bug)

1) foo.tex

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{hyperref}
%\usepackage{nameref}
\label{A}
\newtheorem{theorem}{theorem}
\begin{document}
\section{One}
\label{sect-1}
\section{Two}
\label{sect-2}
\begin{theorem}[Great Theorem]\label{th-1}
$1+1=2$
\end{theorem}
\ref{th-1}
\nameref{th-1}
\end{document}
\ref correctly returns theorem number
\nameref returns Section Name

2) bar.tex

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{xr-hyper}
\usepackage{hyperref}
%\usepackage{nameref}
\externaldocument[foo-]{foo}[foo.pdf]
\begin{document}
\ref{foo-th-1}
\nameref*{foo-th-1}
\ref{foo-A}
\nameref{foo-A}
\end{document}

\ref, \nameref, ... to foo-th-1 return the same as th-1 in foo.tex

but

\ref{foo-A}, \nameref{foo-A}

return an error (not just ? like \ref{foo-B}). I would expect from
\nameref{foo-A} to return a title of "foo.tex"

Thanks for reporting.
Now it's fixed in nameref 2.37.

Yes, therefore I have added it in hyperref 6.80v.

The following code from memhfixc explains Victor's remark,
that adding \usepackage{nameref} works:

|  \AtBeginDocument{%
|    \@ifpackageloaded{nameref}{\let\nameref\titleref}{}%
|  }

With \usepackage{nameref} this code redefines \nameref.
Otherwise, hyperref loads nameref later using \AtBeginDocument.

In any case, this code is unhappy, because hyperref has
to define a star variant of \nameref, see Victor's other problem.

Yours sincerely

Message-ID: <u2y286906751004160245q29940fayde1660ee7a3a20f8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi buddies,

I need a little help here.

Trying to build a PDF presentation (latex-beamer class) with pdflatex.
An image has transparent background; however, inside the PDF it has a
black background. This is when I create the PDF on FreeBSD 8. In the
other hand, when I create it on Linux Fedora 12 it looks good.

Since it is a PNG image, I thought it was a libpng problem, but I have
the latest release (1.4) and the teTeX-base port was recently build.

There's some thing else I don't understand. Look at this:

$ file `which pdflatex`
/usr/local/bin/pdflatex: symbolic link to `pdfetex'

- On Fedora 12

$ ldd $(which pdfetex)
        linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0x00626000)
        libpng12.so.0 => /usr/lib/libpng12.so.0 (0x00404000)
        libz.so.1 => /lib/libz.so.1 (0x00d39000)
        libkpathsea.so.4 => /usr/lib/libkpathsea.so.4 (0x00d1d000)
        libpoppler.so.5 => /usr/lib/libpoppler.so.5 (0x0485e000)
        libstdc++.so.6 => /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00513000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0x00cea000)
        libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x004a2000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00b73000)
        liblcms.so.1 => /usr/lib/liblcms.so.1 (0x07c85000)
        libjpeg.so.62 => /usr/lib/libjpeg.so.62 (0x05a45000)
        libfreetype.so.6 => /usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6 (0x0036a000)
        libfontconfig.so.1 => /usr/lib/libfontconfig.so.1 (0x0042e000)
        libopenjpeg.so.2 => /usr/lib/libopenjpeg.so.2 (0x07ef6000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x00b51000)
        libexpat.so.1 => /lib/libexpat.so.1 (0x00340000)


On FreeBSD 8

$ ldd `which pdfetex`
/usr/local/bin/pdfetex:
	libpng.so.6 => /usr/local/lib/libpng.so.6 (0x28168000)
	libz.so.5 => /lib/libz.so.5 (0x2818d000)
	libstdc++.so.6 => /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 (0x2819f000)
	libm.so.5 => /lib/libm.so.5 (0x28293000)
	libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x282ad000)
	libc.so.7 => /lib/libc.so.7 (0x282b8000)

You see? In one OS it uses libpng and not libjpeg, and viceversa. But
it still process my PNG image in both of them (just with the issue
above).

teTeX-base port, on FreeBSD, has no config options; so I can't modify
configure options without know what I'm doing.

Any suggestion?

Thanks in advance.

Ok. I used bmeps to convert PNG into PDF, so it works now. I guess the
linux binary has some adtional step.

Thank you anyway.

It's fixed in nameref 2.38, but I haven't uploaded yet.

You have to put \label *after* package nameref is loaded,
hyperref loads it using \AtBeginDocument.

I took hyperref 2010/04/16 v6.80w (including nameref 2.38) from TUG
and tried again. Still this particular example does not work.
(BTW, thanks for taking care of theorems)

>From foo.aux
\newlabel{MyLabel}{{}{1}{\relax }{}{}}
and
bar.tex stumbles upon \ref{foo-MyLabel}
It does not return ? but an error

{\@thirdoffive }\fi \endgroup  \end {document}
! File ended while scanning use of \Hy at setref@link.
<inserted text>
                \par
<*> bar.tex

? q
OK, entering \batchmode...
! Emergency stop.
<*> bar.tex

*** (job aborted, no legal \end found)

If I manually edit
\newlabel{MyLabel}{{}{1}{\relax }{}{}}
replacing it by
\newlabel{MyLabel}{{My Great Article}{1}{\relax }{}{}}

then foo.tex returns My Great Article


So, I think that if the label is not inside of any environment, it is
*still* inside of the largest environment document itself and the
title of document should go there.

I think that this makes a sense with xr-hyper




\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{nameref}
\label{MyLabel}
\begin{document}
blah
\end{document}



%%%bar.tex%%%
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{xr-hyper}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{nameref}
\externaldocument[foo-]{foo}[foo.pdf]
\begin{document}
blah
\nameref{foo-MyLabel}
\end{document}

Hello,

I am trying to use package longtable to get a really long table in my
thesis. However, at the final stage of converting ps to pdf, i get the
following error:

--------------------------------------------------
Error: /undefined in nd

--------------------------------------------------


I tried checking with longtable examples given on net, and the error
persists, so it is not a problem with the syntax i used. If i put the
table in a test.tex file, and try to get pdf, i can get test.pdf. So
it is probably clashing with something else i defined in my main.tex?
Here is the header of my main.tex file:

This error message comes from Ghostscript and obviously one of your
.eps files can't be processed properly.  Does it work outside the
longtable environment?

I assume that the error is caused by an included graphics file.  Could
you try to convert all .eps files to PDF and check whether they are
are converted properly?  On Unix it can be done easily on the command
line: 

   for f in *.eps; do epstopdf $f; done

Which Tex distribution are you using?  Which operating system?

The error was caused by a corrupted eps file, as you suggested. I was
trying very hard to get a long table in the thesis, and forgot that i
had uncommented a line to include a certain figure. The error was
caused by the corrupted graphics file, and not the long table, as i
incorrectly assumed.

Sorry for the noise.

thanks,

But the title can be defined after \begin{document}, the only
condition is that \title must be used before \maketitle.

> I think that this makes a sense with xr-hyper

The problem in this example is rather that xr-hyper/hyperref
don't see an anchor name and assumes that the label was written
without nameref/hyperref.
  At least I have updated hyperref v6.80x/nameref v2.39,
that the initial value is "Doc-Start" (this will be set as anchor
by hyperref in \begin{document}).

But I still don't think that \label *before* \begin{document}
is not the best recommended way. For example, before the first
page it is put on the first page (the way \special works).
Thus the page number is "1" instead of a more reasonable "0".

For package zref, module xr I had written a more sophisticated parser.
Now (zref v2.12) I have updated the module and added the feature to convert
the imported references to standard LaTeX references. Therefore I think,
xr-hyper/xr can be replaced by:

  \usepackage{zref-xr}
  \zxrsetup{%
    % verbose,% imported labels are shown in the .log file
    % tozreflabel=false,% if zref is not needed otherwise
    toltxlabel,
  }
  \zexternaldocument*[foo-]{foo}[foo.pdf]

If `nameref' is used (hyperref), it must be loaded *before*
the first \zexternaldocument.

Message-ID: <g2g19af81401004180414gaf5937cfh54aa4e885bbe5288@mail.gmail.com>

There is an accessibility function "Read out loud" in
acroread/acrobat. Unfortunately it does not work well with beamer
unless each frame consists of just one slide (page). F.e.

\begin{frame}
blah
\pause
ouch
\end{frame}


is read as "blah blah ouch"

Sure, using Acrobat one can post-edit pdf file (tagging) but it is
extremely long, tedious and error prone for say 100 pages (and beamer
presentation could have much more slides/pages). Is it possible to
have automatic tagging in beamer (presuming that inside of the same
frame text is only added, neither removed, nor replaced)

Have you tried passing the "handout" option to beamer:

\documentclass[handout]{beamer}

and recompiling? That should ignore the pauses and other overlay
specifications and put only one pdf page for each frame. Whatever you
do, you'll have to decide what to do with overlay specifications that
are for things that get REPLACED or removed on some slides of a frame,
e.g.,

...
\item<1-2> blah
\item<3-4> ouch
...

or using \only<> or whatever. Beamer will allow you to include in such
directives how to handle these for handouts, e.g.,

...
\item<1-2| handout:1-> blah
\item<3-4| handout:0> ouch

will put blah but not ouch in the output frame.

Sure I know this option but the problem is that I want to drop on the
screen the beamer with a lot of pauses and to have a proper
synchronized reading. Basically I am interested in such reading for

\begin{itemize}\begin{itemize}[<+- | alert at +>]

\item (no more than 1 line)
\item (no more than 1 line)
\item (no more than 1 line)
....
\end{itemize}

and at the moment when the line is read, it also should be highlited

Your query follows on from the one you asked me offline: can a PDF be
controlled remotely? Yes it is possible to use pdflatex to construct
a document where text is read out and lines are highlighted in sync,
and it can be automated after a fashion. The approach relies on
using JavaScript and its tts methods, rather than the more common
tagged screen reading. One weakness of the approach 
is tha there is no tts method for waiting on the speech buffer to 
drain. Another, which is probably a show stopper in your case, is that
the software approach is not beamer friendly. For it works best
when the main presentation is /Widget based rather than page-stream based.

It's on my TODO list to prepare an example for Ross Moore that
shows how the approach might be used to walk a reader through
a long, complex equation using multiple scans. In the mean time
you might care to take a look at:

    http://www.amrita-ebook.org/frpaa/draft/jfk-9-12-1962.pdf

which shows a different, but related problem: how does one
synchronize a speech, in video form, with its transcript.
The example was my way of celebrating the 30th anniversary
of the moon landing. It's plucked out of a portfolio
which discusses the Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA),
and so some of its features won't work, but the synchronization
does. And as luck would have it, the FRPAA was reintroduced
to the US House of Representatives last Friday, and so is topical.

My portfolio on the act, see:

http://www.amrita-ebook.org/frpaa/draft/jjq-frpaa.pdf

is a bit of a dog's dinner, and not really intended for public
consumption. But all I'm really pointing out is that if the
act were embraced by the agencies it targets there
will be a need to accelerate the development of document technologies
that support the concept of active books which allow readers
to try out the reported work firsthand .

James, thanks

Remote control was a serious question and after you pointed me out to
"Collaborate" I investigated it and found that Acrobat Collaborate
really gives such an option. I tested it (albeit without Skype as a
voice carrier as Skype was not installed on the resident PC in our
seminar room)

http://wiki.math.toronto.edu/TorontoMathWiki/index.php/Video_Seminar

which gives a real opportunity to give a talk from another location
(normal video stream does not have high enough resolution to see
beamer presentation or blackboard writing without efforts).

What I am interested now is different: once a year my wife runs award
ceremony for school kids in some math competition in the room filled
with 250 of them and when she calls someone simultaneously we display
the name highlighted. She wants to push reading names to computer (so
if name is not called properly she could blame "the stupid computer"
:-)

I understand your application here is different. But the solution path of 
an "active document" is identical in spirit to the home-brew solution I 
would have constructed for your first application. Anyhow, my ulterior 
motive in replying to your message was to point out the reintroduction of 
the FRPAA, which has far reaching consequences for the communication of 
science and mathematics. Hence its relevance to many, but certainly not 
all, TeX aficionados. Ot to put it another way. If the FRPAA were 
embraced, how will TeX remain relevant in the medium to far term.

Victor,

I whipped up the example:

   http://www.amrita-ebook.org/tex-group/tts-sync.pdf

which recites a bunch of names grabbed from:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:English_scientists

The PDF includes the AMRITA source I wrote plus the resultant TeX it 
generates. So you should be able to back out a standalone TeX 
example should it resemble what you want. To do this you'll need to 
examine the attachments of the attachment AMRGI1.pdf .

A problem I have been unable to solve is how to get a PDF to reload to
the same page when the file changes.  Alternatively, I would need some
method to control the page of the reader (and to be able to read the
current page) by an external script.  I've tried a lot of different
readers and methods and none allow this - or I'm missing something.

Maybe you have an idea?

Linux AR9.x now provides a reload functionality, key short-cut Ctrl-R,
which basically does what you want. But I don't think it has made it
into either the Windows or OSX versions. 

> 
> Maybe you have an idea?

The lack of a reload has never bothered me, because of the way I work. For 
instance, if you check out the bookmarks panel in the above, tts-sync.pdf, 
and click on ``mk_sync'' under ``Document Source'' you'll activate
a swf-powered browser that shows how the document is generated.
Or at least it will for Windows AR and Linux AR, OSX AR is broken!

Anyhow, I basically write a program that writes a LaTeX file, and the 
program takes care of invoking pdflatex to process the resultant LaTeX and 
it will also invoke AR as needed. And in the case of a document
such as:

   http://www.amrita-ebook.org/draft/jjq-on-4th-Paradigm.pdf

which involves much tinkering with a single page, the programming model
includes a ``coldstart'' construct that will automatically invoke
the JavaScript needed to get the page state I'm currently working on,
which is more involved than just jumping to a page; it involves
traversing a tree of /Widgets and excuting event handlers.

Of course none of this will help you, owing to the peculiarities
of what I do; Quirk by name and quirk by nature. But from your
email address it seems you might be reasonably close by. So if you
ever find yourself near Old Town Alexandria, VA. Drop me an e-mail
and I'll show you what your options might be.

Linux AR9.x now includes reload support directly. The approach that 
Alexander Grahn developed, and which I commented on in this group, or 
maybe the pdftex group, is unreliable owing to AR's internal construction. 
For instance at my end it caused AR to crash and my recoding of what 
Alexander had written, which employed a JavaScript closure, would not work 
at all at his end, but worked fine at mine. But if his package works for 
you then great! Also, the trick of adding a custom-button to AR's is 
always useful to know.

I just dug out the e-mail response I got when I filed a bug report
concerning the reloading crash. It reads:

Subject: RE: Bug # 2270294: Problem loading a refreshed PDF

The problem you are running into is that (at least on the Mac and Win, 
don't know about Linux), Acrobat doesn't immediately close the file when 
you close the window - there is a delay of up to 30 seconds.  The reason 
for this is due to a complexity of the browser-integration process.

In case it useful to someone out there: Skim is a versatile pdf-reader for 
OS X that reloads to the same page if desired, and allows for easy 
retrieval of the source code corresponding to a given place in the pdf and 
vice versa.  I use it with Aquamacs, an Emacs-based editor for OS X.

It seems to be a way that, when focused on the reader one can tell it
to reload.  That's no good as I want to generate a new PDF from LaTeX
and automatically have it update.  So maybe there is a way to modify
that script so it checks for upload ever second and uploads if the
date of the pdf file has changed?  Alternatively I would need a way to
kick the reader to wake up and reload.

The reason I'm interested is because I don't use texshop but rather
simply edit my .tex files in vim and then write them out.  A program I
developed (and which was rewritten in perl by Jeff Haemer) called
atchange then runs LaTeX/bibTeX automatically for me.  I don't want to
have to take my fingers off the keyboard as the display is refreshed! 
That takes time - thousands of times a day ...

That's left as an exercise for the reader!

If you view the relevant JavaScript, using the built-in
browser, accessible from the bookmarks panel, you'll notice
I use a single JavaScript closure that allows an implementation
with private data, private functions and public functions.
Thus there's a nice sef-containd structure in which to add
whatever functionality might be required.

Not quite - as I mentioned in the previous posting, I want it hands

Tom,

To some degree I already am controlling AR. Specifically, 
when I open an AMRITA-generated PDF I use amrpdf which pre-processes 
the PDF and then launches AR on the processed PDF with a communication
pipe. This allows me to do things like unpack and run examples
on-the-fly. See for instance:

    http://www.amrita-cfd.org/doc/amr2003

and be sure to read the built-in security FAQ. It's just that
I've not had need for what you want and so the precise functionality
is missing.

Are you wanting to have a watched folder and have AR automatically
reload when a file has changed? If so, that could easily be accomplished
by polling a localhost url that invoked a script that checked on the 
watched folder.
  
Anyhow you didn't mention what platform your using. If it's Linux,
and your local, it wouldn't be that big a deal for me to implement
what you want, provided you gave me a more explicit design brief offline.

Tom, since you mention (but don't use) texshop, I'm guessing you're using 
OS X:  As I metioned earlier, Skim is very good for what you seem to want, 
and apparently can be integrated with vim:

race condition, we use \AtBeginDocument + \@ifpackageloaded{nameref} to 
do our stuff.

It is well known that this may cause a race condition.

I will change memhfixc to use \AtPackageEnd instead. The minimal example 
I posted earlier, seems to do the trick, and your test shows ok on all 
the links

OK. You didn't reply yet as to what platform you're using.
But with Linux, all you need do is:

(i) Install xdotool which you can grab from:

   http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool

The description from its manual page reads:

xdotool lets you programatically (or manually) simulate keyboard input and 
mouse activity, move and resize windows, etc. It does this
       using X11's XTEST extension and other Xlib functions.


(ii) Add the following perl to your atchange script:

my $wid= (`xdotool search --title "Adobe Reader"`)[0]; chomp $wid;
system("xdotool key --window $wid ctrl+r");

The first line will get the window used by AR. Note xdotool may return 
more than one window so we grab the first one and get rid of the line 
separator. The second line then sends the reload short-cut to the target 
window.

I've tested it at my end (OpenSUSE 10.3+KDE+AR9.3.2) and
it works quite nicely, but I've yet to fully explore
xdotool so I can't comment on any foibles it might have.

It seems that the  --window option is not the thing to use,
for reading from the manual page:


Sending keystrokes to a specific window uses a different API than simply 
typing to the active window. If you specify 'xdotool type --win???
       dow 12345 hello' xdotool will generate key events and send them 
directly to window 12345.  However, X11 servers will set a special flag
       on all events generated in this way (see XEvent.xany.send_event in 
X11's manual). Many programs observe this flag and reject these
       events.

Therefore this variant is to be preferred:

chomp(my $wid= (qx{xdotool search --title "Adobe Reader"})[0]);
system("xdotool windowactivate $wid");
system("xdotool key --window $wid ctrl+r");


And as a concrete exmaple of the difference between the two:
the former can't copy with AR's single-key accelerator, h and
z, for hand and zoom modes, whereas the latter can.

Hi,
maybe a bit late ...
however,

1) the reload function after file change is a feature of different 
pdf-viewers under Linux.

2) For other readers, the depicted page can be reloaded with a parameter 
flag from the command line.

No need for external programs you just have to call the pdf-viewer with 
a certain parameter flag from your latex editor, or it even detects the 
change automagically and refresh.

Unfortunately, I forgot which reader is capable of which feature.
But check the typical readers for your distro. okualar, xpdf, evince.

I once wrote a little python script which observed the desired pdf file 
and send the refresh command if the file changed. With this the 
functionality of the 2nd kind of viewers became the same as for the 
first kind. Unfortunately I can not find it anymore....

Greetings

Torsten

That's all true, except sometimes one is forced to use AR as it is the 
only viewer that supports a desired for PDF feature. Thus the approach 
outlined here may be of use to some people, some of the time.
But it is certainly not suggestes as a universal route.

this is intended, \theoremstyle have a different meaning in ntheorem. In 
amsthm it is only used to control the fonts. In ntheorem it is the 
output style, not the actual formatting.

Learn to use \theorembodyfont

read the manual, there is no such thing as \theoremstyle{definition} in 
ntheorem, \theoremstyle takes arguments like plain, break, change, 
margin, and \theoremstyle{plain} in ntheorem is NOT that same as in amsthm.

What is it you want to do with ntheorem? Do what 
\theoremstyle{definition} does in amsthm?

\theoremstyle{plain} % this is the default
\theorembodyfont{\normalfont}
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}

OK, I found solution (not sure if it is the best one as it is
modification of something found over internet); other solution is just
to hack ntheorem (in two lines)

\renewtheoremstyle{definition}%
{\item[\hskip\labelsep \bfseries{##1 ##2}]}%
{\item[\hskip\labelsep \bfseries{##1 ##2}: {##3} ]}
\theoremstyle{definition}
\theorembodyfont{\upshape}

but why do you need \thereomstyle{definition}?

the output is the same as

\theoremstyle{plain}
\theorembodyfont{\upshape}

Yes - without [amsthm] switch but the latter throws a monkey wrench
into this. Probably it would be better just to remove it and redefine

proof is the same as

\theoremsymbol{\enspace\ensuremath{\square}}
\theoremstyle{nonumberplain}
\theoremheaderfont{\normalfont\itshape}
\theorembodyfont{\normalfont}
\newtheorem{proof}{Proof}

good idea to supplement it with

\theoremstyle{empty}
\newtheorem{proofof}{}

then

\begin{proofof}[Proof of theorem~\ref{thm:3}]

is the same as

\begin{proof}[Proof of theorem~\ref{thm:3}] in amsthm

I was just wondering whether anyone might know of a way for multiple

to download the source to view the typeset output, so it would be nice if 
the typesetting could be done and its output viewed at the same central

While this doesn't satisfy all your needs, this may be an approach using
googledocs that might interest you.

Message-ID: <r2g999898701004201238n93a4fce7g5a6186efbde85e12@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am a little confused about the binding space settings, for a thesis
to be printed two-sided. I tried the package geometry. Here are the
relevant lines:

\documentclass[12pt,twoside]{report}
\usepackage[twoside,bindingoffset=1in]{geometry}

But this does not seem to be working. I want different binding margins
for odd and even numbered pages. But that does not seem to be the
case. Is the command above wrong?

Can someone share their thesis margin settings for two sided printing
(\oddsidemargin, \evensidemargin etc)? Our institute does not have a
specification, so it is up to me. Nobody at my department uses latex,
so no templates either.

thanks,
arvind

Since tex files are plain text, any remotely accessible version
control system (CVS, subversion, git...) would work.

I don't have the commands in my mind at the moment. But I know it is a 
common error to believe that the margins which will create the middle of 
the book have to be wider then the outer margins. Please check for this. 
A correct set-up should give you exact three margins.
|------| Text |---*---| Text |------|
* indicate the book-middle. As you can see the left and right size 
margins have the same width like both inner margins together. This 
results in a uniform look margin,text,margin,text,margin....

Furthermore, depending on how many pages you have and which kind of 
binding you choice there might be no need for an additional 
bindingoffset. I can not remember exactly so please use this numbers 
with care but for a hot-glue binding and less then 100-150 pages it 
should work without corrections.
Other binings allow more or less to bind the book which might require 
more or less correction. Check which kind of binding you will choice. 
However 1 inch seems fare to much...

In general, an additional but unnecessary correction looks finally much 
more wrong then no correction.

As a conclusion of my blabla... use it really with care

Just for clarification you are looking for a way to work and display 
your manuscripts online (in a web-browser applet) maybe even with 
multiple authors? If so, only a server-based solution might be 
available. In that case I would check the capabilities of open source 
document managment systems.

If you "only" like to have a way multiple authors can access a document 
work on it an resubmit changes to it use, as mentioned already, 
subversion or git or mercury or cvs, etc.

Since those tools came for collaborative coding of exteremly large 
projects (like the linux kernel), they are very powerful in merging text 
(code) together, track changes, grant access, accept and reject changes, 
etc.

However, this makes only sense IMHO for larger documents like a book or 
longer article. Otherwise you would constantly have the problem that two 
different authors make different changes on the same text. In that case 
all the above tools need human assistance to sort out which of the 
changes should be applied and which should be rejected. However, the 
tools help you greatly in doing so quickly and efficient.

Hope that helps

Torsten

Thanks for the info. I was trying different values to check how it
ought to look like. I am not going to use 1 inch. For that matter, my
thesis is ~260 pages, so i might need extra space on the inside
(middle).

However, my impression was that with the twoside option, the geometry
package would give different left and right margins for odd and even
numbered pages. You are saying it should give the same margin for both
pages. But it seems to be doing neither. What i am getting is a larger
margin on the right, and slightly smaller margin on the left, for all
the pages. Why is that?

thanks,
arvind

This is exactly what I am saying. Please put two sheets between each 
other in the way they would appear in the book.
Like page 2-3. As you can seen now. the outer left and right margin have 
the same space like the inner left and right margin together. This is 
intentional. Check a good typeset commercial book and you will find it 
is true. It only look strange as long as you pile up all sheets together 
(like your pdf-viewer will display them one under the other). As soon as 
you arrange them to a "2 page view" they look fine.

Regards,

Torsten

Hi, experts

I did some upgrade on my system, may be my cygwin, may be texlive
iteself. ?It happened several weeks ago and I am not so sure about
what part of upgrading leads to the problem.

The beamer presentations (even those provided as samples with beamer
package) can not be compiled any more. ?I use pdflatex, if the
presentation contains more than one frame, it will produce an error:

! Incompatible list can't be unboxed.

But all my beamer documents worked before! ? Where should I come to
find information?

Thanks.

I do this, too. The disadvantage to this solution is that you need to
have an svn server running and connected to the net. Google supplies
this with googledocs. But if one has the server and connection, I
think subversion (or some other version control server) superior to
googledocs for one reason: control. With googledocs you loose privacy;
and what if Google decides to phase googledocs out or to start
charging for it? For casual use, okay. But for mission critical work,
I cannot justify depending upon some company who doesn't have my
interests at heart.

I do not follow your argument. For a moment, ignore what happens in
the middle, in the "2 page view". The way you showed the schematic in
your first mail, the left margin of page 2 and right margin of page 3
are of unequal length. Shouldn't they be of the same width by your own
argument, and the schematic you plotted? (For that matter, the middle
length is also not satisfactory - and yes, i did check by taking
printouts of two pages, and placing them in a "2 page view".)

Arvind,

There is no real convention with regards to inner and outer width  
dimensions. In some cases they are of equal width and in others they  
vary quite remarkably (both positive and negative variances). In some  
places in the world it seems there is an accepted wisdom that there  
should be a positive difference (US?) and in others it seems that  
there should be none or negative (Northern Europe?).

Ultimately it depends on what kind of binding method you are going to  
use. For example if the book is thin and saddle stitched then you can  
get away with having no difference between inner and outer margins,  
whereas if it is thick and perfect bound (say a thick paper back) then  
a wider inner margin is desired because the volume will not lay flat  
and will be difficult for the reader push it open sufficiently to  
read. If the binding is sewn and hard cover bound then a wider inner  
margin is desirable but it may not be as wide as that needed for a  
paper back novel. Then, if you are going to spiral bind your thesis  
for marking then make certain the inner margin is going to be wide  
enough to accommodate the holes that will be punched through the paper.

After several decades I have not encountered a publisher who has  
required that the outer margins should be wider than the inner, but  
that may be a geo-sociological issue. I am not based in western/ 
northern Europe and conventions there may be different. I agree that  
this is counter intuitive.

I am surprised that the thesis is to be printed on two sides however.  
 From what I have seen, most are printed on one side only which makes  
the discussion moot since the page margins will all be the same. Then  
the most important consideration becomes how much margin space to  
allow for markers' comments.

In your case, I don't know what stage you are at. That is why I made  
the additional observations.

Alan

Subject: [texhax] Last CFP: DML 2010--Towards a Digital Mathematics Library,
	Paris, Jul 7-8th
Message-ID: <20100421202600.2B920705F2@anxur.fi.muni.cz>

Call for papers: Towards a Digital Mathematics Library (DML 2010)
July 7-8th, 2010, Paris, FR c/o CICM 2010

Web: http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/dml-2010.html

Deadlines: April 25th: abstract submissions 
           April 28th: paper submissions 
           May 15th: paper acceptance/rejection decision
           May 22nd: versions for the proceedings due
           Jul 7th: workshop date, proceedings on site

Submissions:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=dml2010
Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, 
potential impact for building DML, and clarity. Final paper versions should
conform to the Springer LNCS (llncs class) style, preferably using LaTeX2e.

Submission categories:
Full paper: 4-12 LNCS pages
Short paper/poster/work in progress report: 1-4 LNCS pages 

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects 
(EuDML, NUMDAM, DML-CZ,...), asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow)?

Proceedings:
will be published by Masaryk University Press and will be available on site 
in printed form and in digital form from DML-CZ repository. All previous 
DML proceedings have been indexed by Thomson Reuters in Conference Proceedings 
Citation Index CPCI and by Google Scholar and are available in digital form 
at http://dml.cz/handle/10338.dmlcz/702563 . Best papers will be chosen for 
a postconference book published by renowned publisher or for a journal special issue.

Keynote (TBC): Masakazu Suzuki (Project Infty, Kyushu University, JP)

Topics: 
(include, but are not limited to)
  o search, indexing and retrieval of mathematical documents
  o ranking of mathematical papers, similarity of mathematical documents
  o math OCR with MathML/TeX output
  o document conversions from/to MathML, OpenMath, LaTeX,
    PostScript and [tagged] PDF
  o conversions between various mathematical formalisms
  o mathematical document compression
  o processing of scanned images
  o algorithms for crosslinking of bibliographical items, 
    intext citations search
  o mathematical document classification, MSC 2010
  o mathematical text mining
  o mathematical documents metadata exchange via OAI-PMH and/or OAI-ORE
  o long term archiving, data migration
  o reports and experience from math digitization projects
  o math publishing with long term archival goal
  o software engineering aspects of creating, handling MathML, 
    OMDoc, OpenMath documents, and displaying them in web browsers

Many thanks for the elaboration. I finally used old-fashioned
\oddsidemargin, \evensidemargin and \textwidth to adjust the margins.
I will discuss with the binding guy, and change the margins if
necessary.

As for your other observations, there seems to be no rule at my
institute, either about the margins, or about one-sided or two-sided
printing. Very few people use latex, and i have seen a really ugly
thesis in my own lab, with hardly any margin, and two-sided. In my
case, the number of pages is 271, and one-sided would make it a really
huge book in print. So i am going for two-sided printing. I will be
leaving sufficient margin for notes/comments etc by the reviewers.

regards,
arvind

having no rules might often be a good idea. Have a look at many of the 
rules used in US universities, they often go for the least common 
denominator (if that is even a term in English), totally ruining the 
look of the thesis.

I like the idea of having guidelines for those who does not know what to 
do, but if they like to experiment with margins, fonts etc. (and have 
the talent for it), they should be able to. I've seen a few VERY good 
looking thesis which would never have happened if these strict rules 
were enforced.

Subject: [texhax] Handling arrays or lists in LaTeX command arguments
Message-ID: <4BCF8F11.6050804@301south.net>

Hi TeXers,

I'm hunting for a TeX or LaTeX macro which processes an argument as a 
[c-style] array with a (possibly arbitrary, possibly fixed) number of 
entries.

For instance, I imagine three hypothetical LaTeX commands:

\defarray{\arrayname}{num}{[element1,element2,element3...]}

creates an array called \arrayname with num elements.  Here I assume the 
elements are comma-separated and enclosed in brackets, but that is just 
for example.

\arraydo{\arrayname}{operation}

performs 'operation' once for each element in the array in succession.

\thearrayelement

(within \arraydo) expands to the current element in the array.

Is such a thing remotely possible?  Anything that points in this 
direction would be appreciated.  The ability to index into the array 
would be extra-special.



%%-----------------------
%% code sample

\newcommand{\boxnumbers}[1]{ %
   \arraydo{#1}{% hypothetical array expander
	\fbox{\thearrayelement}\;%
	} %
}

% The Sequence
\defarray{\foo}{6}{[4,8,15,16,23,42]} % hypothetical array constructor

\boxnumbers{\foo}

%% end code sample
%%-----------------------

would create a series of boxes, each containing a number from The Sequence.

thanks for any pointers,
Brandon

Subject: [texhax] beamer: show next section
Message-ID: <4BCFDD55.6040705@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I am quite forgetful and therefore often don?t remember what section
comes next in a beamer presentation. So when one section is ended, I
want to stop for questions from the audience. But I don?t want to show
all sections in the header as I find that too bloated for me, and also
don?t want to use a toc at every section. What I am asking for is a
reference to the current section (what is already there) and (say, in
light grey) a reference to the next one ? preferably only at the last
slide of the current section.

Is this possible? If so, what should I look for?

cheers
Arno

hi,

i need some help to understand the following code: 

\makeatletter
\newcommand{\wrapfootnote}[1]{\stepcounter\@mpfn%

\@footnotetext}
\makeatother

this generate paired footnotes. And if i use only one footnoteapparatus, then its fine. But in combination with the bigfoot package the paired footnotes are grouped but this is not what i want. can you help me. I added a minimalexample so you can see what i mean. 
What i want in the apparatus is:

a-a text
b    text
c-c text 

and not

a-a text
c-c text

b text.

Subject: [texhax] Beamer - footline
Message-ID: <op.vbki38citpjj8f@lpr>

Hello,

I'm creating a beamer presentation.

I'm using the default beamer template and the "beamerthemesplit" package.

I like the presentation to have the footer bar - but I'd like to add a company logo (e.g. "Logo.png") to left part of its left half.

Although I look to the "beameruserguide", I cannot get to know how to add it.

I tried to modify the \author definition to demonstrate the wanted result (see the commented line) - but it's not the right result.

I'd need to divide the footer space are into three parts and use them in the following manner: left = logo, middle = author, right = title.

How to do it?

Thank you in advance.

Lukas

Define your own footline, e.g.:

\usepackage{tabularx}
\setbeamertemplate{footline}{
  \colorbox{blue}{\color{white}
     \begin{tabularx}{0.98\textwidth}{|X|X|X|}
          insertlogo & 
          \hfill\insertshortauthor\hfill\phantom{.} & 
          \hfill\insertshorttitle\\
      \end{tabularx}
}
}

You can build anything you like within the template definition, so you
don't need to use tabularx, but could do something simple like
(untested)

\centerline{\insertlogo\hfill\insertshortauthor\hfill\insertshorttitle}

This can all be quite fiddly, (hence the 0.98\textwidth), but you get
the idea?

PS There's also a latex-beamer-users at lists.sourceforge.net forum which
you might find helpful.

hyperref.

You can just use \label and \ref to insert hyperlinks. You can label a 
frame and insert a link to that frame from your "Questions"-slide.

\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{hyperref}

\begin{document}

\begin{frame}[label=target]
  \frametitle{Target slide}
  Foo.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Source slide}
  \hyperlink{target}{\beamerbutton{Jump to target slide}}

That's perfect!!!  With a bit of a struggle I learned how to access
the hidden(!) parameter that makes Skim watch and read a file when it
updates.  This finally solved the problem of how to automate this.  I
have recorded what I know about it into a script that allows one to
set it up:

Are you using the CVS version of pgf/TikZ? If so then try to get the 
latest one. I had the same error a couple of days ago and updating pgf 
to the newest version solved the problem.

I've whipped up another example that shows how a TeX document
can now leverage of a SWF to endow a PDF with TTS, see:

   http://www.amrita-ebook.org/tex-group/swf-tts.pdf

Here I've just grabbed two pre-existing demos from a company called 
SitePal, and they probably won't have universal appeal to the readers of 
this group. But it would appear to be possible for SitePal suscribers to 
author their own SWF's, with calls to the underlying TTS engine, in which 
case one could construct a more serious example. Unfortunatly, given the 
amount of money involved, I very much doubt that ``she who must be 
obeyed'' would sanction the project. :-(

Hi Arvind,

sorry for my late reply, I was absent for the last two days.

I do not know what happend to the schematic during the mail process. 
However, it was intended to depict the same length for the left margin 
of page 2 and the right margin of page 3.
Please find below a more detailed explanation:

Lets give numbers to the margins to avoid confusion:

     1           2   3           4
|------| Text |---*---| Text |------|
* indicate the later book-middle.
An example would be
if margin 1 and margin 4 are 1.5 inch
then margin 2 and margin 3 are 0.75 inch which gives together 1.5 inch.

As mentioned later by Alan, the rule I like to describe might be 
different from major to major or from country to country. So fare it was 
the only rule I know. Thanks to Alan to widen my view.
The rule I follow is rather nearly as old as book printing itself [1], I 
was always pleased with the result.

My respond to your request was just to make sure that you are not 
misunderstood that margins 2 and 3 smaller even after adding binding 
corrections. This was what happen to me when I came the first time along 
this. Thus, to say, even with binding correction margin 2 and 3 might 
still be smaller then margin 1 and 4.

Hope now my intention is more clear.

Best regards,

Torsten

I've taken advantage of SitePal's 15 day free trial to produce:

    http://www.amrita-cfd.org/tex-group/Euler-identity.pdf

which is a better example for those interested in tts for mathematics.
Note that the avatar weighs in at just 9029 bytes. Also note it should
be possible to synchronize the text with highlighting of the equation,
which would be quite useful when dealing with expressions that
cover an entire page.

That's to be expected as it uses /RichMedia annotations, which did not
appear until V8. But I recommend you view the example using Adobe Reader

Hello,

just a quick question - does the LaTeX3e manual exist?

I'm still using

LATEX: Structured documents for TEX
unofficial LATEX reference manual
version 2.0, June 2008

which relates to LaTeX2e.

I looked for \centerline statement in it, but there was none. Maybe this is due to LaTeX3e manual being used.

But I'm not able to find any newer version of the manual...

Regards,

Lukas

You are still using LaTeX2e.  \centerline is a macro defined in plain
TeX which can be used in LaTeX.  Its definition is:

  \def\centerline#1{\hbox to \hsize{\hss#1\hss}}

where \hsize is the width of the colunm and \hss is horizontal
shrinkable glue.  If it's used at the begin of an indented paragraph,
it should be preceded by \noindent. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

This is purely a guess, but my suspicion is that your
are looking in the wrong direction.  \centerline is
defined in Plain TeX, and although it is used in one
example in The LaTeX Companion (p.~307, 2nd~ed.)
I suspect it is not a "real" LaTeX command at all,
and even less likely to be a LaTeX-3 command.  But
I could be completely wrong : I know almost nothing
about LaTeX :-)

Message-ID: <fc.00802ed70fb8e7f300802ed70fb8e7f3.fb8ebe1@furman.edu>

Suppose that my LaTeX document starts like this:


\documentclass[twoside]{book} 
\usepackage[margin=1in,twoside]{geometry}
\usepackage{fancyhdr} 
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}
\fancyhead[LE,RO]{\thepage}
\fancyhead[RE]{\leftmark}
\fancyhead[LO]{\rightmark}


My publisher wants to know the answer to these questions:

 "I would like to know the margin measurements as well as the font,
including? the size used for Chapter title, solutions, section labels, and
header/footers."

He is not LaTeX literate, and I am a user, but not a deep understander of
LaTeX code. 

My questions: Is there an easy way for me to find out the answers to these
questions? Should I look in the Lamport's book, fanchdr documentation, 
geometry package documentation, the LaTeX Companion?

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [texhax] Nested macro definition problem
Message-ID: <20100423141914.GA19216@malaquias.DHCP-GERAL>

Pygments (http://pygments.org/) is an application written in Python for
syntax highlighting of source code, with support for many languages. It
produces ouput in many formats, including LaTeX. Pygments uses styles to
define how the final formatted source code looks like. There are many
available styles.

With the LaTeX formatter, which produces a LaTeX document or a snippet
of a LaTeX document, the style definition is a set of macros used to
typset the source code.

The attached file pyg.sty contains the set of macro definitions
corresponding to the default style, generated by the application.

In order to allow the use of more than one highlighting style in the
same LaTeX document, I would like to define a macro for each available
style. The expansion of each macro would be set of macro definitions
specific for that style.

As I do not have much experience in complex macro definitions, I am not
being successfull in making this definitions.

The attached file pyg1.sty has my attempt of defining \styledefault for
the default style.

The attached file test1.tex is a document for testing. When test1.tex is
compiled using pyg1.sty instead of pyg.sty, compilation stops with the
error message:

    Illegal parameter number in definition of \PY at tok@gd.
   <to be read again>
                      1
   l.3 \styledefault

Would anybody help me to solve this problem?

The attached simplified file test2.tex demonstrates de problem I am
having when defining nested macros.

Basically I need to define the macros:

  \def\ma{%
    \def\mb{%
      \def\mc###1{%
        \textbf{###1}}}}

in a LaTeX document, but pdflatex finds the following error:

  ! Illegal parameter number in definition of \ma.
  <to be read again> 
                     1
  l.5     \def\mc###1
                     {%

Why pdflatex does not accepts this macro definition? How can I fix this
problem?

Regards,

Romildo

The number of # is not linear regarding the nesting depth, but
exponential.

The margins and such are easy:

typeset the following (your preamble fragment plus 4 lines)

\documentclass[twoside]{book} 
\usepackage[margin=1in,twoside]{geometry}
\usepackage{fancyhdr} 
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{}
\fancyhead[LE,RO]{\thepage}
\fancyhead[RE]{\leftmark}
\fancyhead[LO]{\rightmark}

\usepackage{layout}
\begin{document}
\layout
\end{document}

which will result in a document that has pictures that show the various
lengths and their values.

I don't know of something similar to show the font sizes, but if you
look at the log file when you typeset the above you will see what class
file(s) were used, e.g.,

(/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/book.cls
Document Class: book 2005/09/16 v1.4f Standard LaTeX document class
(/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/bk10.clo))

The book.cls file defines all the formatting in terms of latex font
sizes, e.g.:

\newcommand\section{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}%
                                   {-3.5ex \@plus -1ex \@minus -.2ex}%
                                   {2.3ex \@plus.2ex}%
                                   {\normalfont\Large\bfseries}}

tells you that the section head will be in the normal font, using
boldface, and size Large. Then bk10.clo tells you what Large means for
the 10pt book class (10pt is the default):

\newcommand\Large{\@setfontsize\Large\@xivpt{18}}

So Large is 14pt (set on 18pt baselines). This is a bit more digging
than you might like, but it should give you everything you need.

If you're in any doubt, just add a few test lines to the empty document,
e.g.

\section{Section Head}

\bf{\Large{Large font}}

and compare the two lines for size.

Not sure there is such a manual.

Anyway, as others have said, \centerline is TeX but can be used in LaTeX.

The LaTeX commands are \centering, which needs scoping or the "center"
environment.

If these are the *only* requirements, and you don't need to
look up individual elements by index, then the existing LaTeX
list handling seems sufficient:

\def\arrayname{element1,element2,element3...}

\@for\thearrayelement:=\arrayname\do{operation}

Subject: [texhax] Integrating LaTeX and external program with auxiliar file
Message-ID: <20100424094632.GA1958@malaquias.DHCP-GERAL>

In order to implement a package for highlighting source code in LaTeX
with the help of the external program pygmentize
(http://www.pygments.org), I am considering the following procedure:

1) first compilation of the document: the contents of every ocorrences
   of the 'pygments' environment are colected and written to the
   auxiliar file \jobname.pygments.

2) an auxiliar program pygmentex processes the auxiliar file
   \jobname.pygments, replacing every snippet of source code by a
   highlighted version, using the pygments system, producing a new
   auxiliar file \jobname.pygmented.

3) second compilation of the document: the contents of the 'pygments'
   environment, now already hightlighted, are recovered from the
   \jobname.pygmented file, and used in the final typesetting of the
   document.

I am looking for references on how to implement this procedure in
LaTeX. Any help?

Romildo

Yes, I know about the minted package. And I have indeed used it. But
minted does not suit all my needs.

For each snippet of source code to be highlighted by pygments, minted
makes an individual call to the pigmentize application.

I am adding a new feature to minted to allow highlighting source code
inline (that is, the snippet is in a running line, not in a paragraph by
itself). With this feature I tend to hightlight many small pieces of
source code. Currently this has the effect of calling pygmentize many
times, making the compilation of the document too long. So I want to
study alternative implementations. The above procedure would call
pygmentex only once. So it would be more efficient.

I do not want to write a new package for that. I would just change
minted. If everything goes well, then I would propose the change to the
author of the minted package.

You did indicate the same length for both left and right margins, in
the schematic in your earlier mail. And i understood it that way. But
you assumed, *incorrectly*, that the geometry package was giving the
same left and right margins for me, and i was complaining about that.
The geometry package was NOT doing that. When provided with the
twoside option, it was giving a longer right margin, and shorter left
margin, for all pages. I was complaining about that.

After going through the entire geometry manual carefully, it is clear
to me why that happened. When provided with the twoside option, the
geometry package provides a 2:3 ratio of left to right margins.
Technically,

marginratio={2:3, 2:3}

where the first number denotes the horizontal margin ratio, and the
second, the vertical margin ratio.

Hence i was getting the right margin longer. I do not know the logic
behind this ratio. Hope this helps someone who turns to this thread
with the same doubt. I should have carefully read the manual earlier,
but i was hard pressed for time.

As for my thesis, i chucked the geometry package, and set about
adjusting the margins using \oddsidemargin, \evensidemargin and
\textwidth.

As i explained above, i understood what you were saying, and i do
agree with you. Only you misunderstood what i was complaining about,
and i was trying to clarify that. I was complaining about margins 1
and 4 being unequal on all pages. Maybe i did not express it very

Thanks for the reference and all the help.

Message-ID: <op.vbmfdwm2tpjj8f@lpr>

Hello,

I'm preparing a beamer presentation.

I have a long frame, but I allowed "allowframebreaks" in it.

The frame should consist of four parts.

Leading automatic frame breaks are OK.

But the last isn't - beamer puts the last block to the lower part of the frame, so it gets almost invisible.

You can see that behavior in the attached .png (= screen shot).

I would need something like \pagebreak or \newpage for frame - somethink like \framebreak or \newframe.

Is there a way how to force frame break?

- I don't want to split it into several ones manually as the automatic division work fine elsewhere; and I don't want to retype sub-frame labels to end by " I", " II" an so on.

Has anyone encountered such a problem?

Thank you in advance.

Regards,

Lukas


NB:

Some "quote" environments are used in the blocks and also \big- and \medskip.

Subject: [texhax] keyval options in the closing part of an environment
Message-ID: <20100426010112.GA13513@malaquias.DHCP-GERAL>

I want to define a new environment using an environment from the
fancyvrb.

In order to simplify the problem, let's consider the following LaTeX
document, which demonstrates the original problem:

  \documentclass[a4paper]{article}
  \usepackage{graphicx}

  \newenvironment{env}[1][]
   {\gdef\temp{#1}
    \begin{quote}}
   {\includegraphics[\temp]{/usr/share/pixmaps/xchat.png}
    \end{quote}}


  \begin{document}

  \begin{env}[width=3cm]
    This is a test.
  \end{env}

  \end{document}

The problem is the use of the options in the closing part of the
environment. Here I want to use the \includegraphics command with the
options passed to the env environment.

pdflatex fails with the error:

  ! Package keyval Error: width=3cm undefined.

  See the keyval package documentation for explanation.
  Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
   ...                                              
                                                    
  l.15 \end{env}

How can I solve this problem? Any hints?

Romildo

\newenvironment*{env}[1][]{%

  \begin{quote}%
}{%
  \expandafter\includegraphics\expandafter
  [\expandafter{\envparam}]{/usr/share/pixmaps/xchat.png}%

}

Package keyval looks for '=' and ','. Therefore these
syntax characters must not be hidden inside a macro.
(The additional curly braces have the purpose to prevent
syntax problems, if #1 contains ']'.)

Another possibility:

\newenvironment*{env}[1][]{%
  \def\envgraphics{%
    \includegraphics[{#1}]{/usr/share/pixmaps/xchat.png}%
  }%
  \begin{quote}%
}{%
  \envgraphics
  \end{quote}%
}

Dear Jose,

since my spanish is very poor I can't even get the meaning of the error 
message.
However, there is a dedicated MikTeX mailing list.

http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=miktex-users


It is more likely you will find help there. TexHax is rather OS and 
TeX-distro independent, thus, many of use use different systems.

Hope that helps a bit

i've never understood why people want this (given that it's never going
to be useful, given it's on the first page of the toc).

anyway, iirc the tocbibind package satisfies this curious requirement.

Another more ambitious one (as compared to Donald Arseneau's response)

    http://ctan.org/pkg/forarray

(more recent than arrayjob)

Dear All,

Is there any particular reason why, since a distro upgrade, when I
type a double hyphen -- in Emacs LaTeX mode, I now get a double quote
followed by an equals sign "= , please?  Typing a third consecutive
hyphen gets me back to having a double hyphen.  In other Emacs modes
(text, Gnuplot), typing a double hyphen produces a double hyphen as
expected.

Thanks,

Dan

Hi Dan,
I can't reproduce this behavior.  But I fear that you are asking on
the wrong mailing list.  It's not a TeX-related problem.  Don't expect
to get much help here.  It's better to ask on Emacs/AucTeX related
mailing lists or newsgroups.  People on this list are more familiar
with TeX macro programming rather than with Emacs Lisp.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] fancyvrb UseVerbatim numbered lines bug
Message-ID: <20100426193846.GA27521@malaquias.DHCP-GERAL>

Hi.

I want to typeset some text verbatim with numbered lines using the
fancyvrb package. In the situation the issue has arisen I need to use
SaveVerbatim and UseVerbatim. Here is a test program:

   \documentclass[a4paper]{article}
   \usepackage{fancyvrb}

   \begin{document}

   \begin{SaveVerbatim}{TestVerb}
     \textcolor{blue}{this} is verbatim
     input using the \emph{Verbatim} environment
     from the fancyvrb package
     ok
   \end{SaveVerbatim}

   \UseVerbatim[frame=single,numbers=left]{TestVerb}

   \end{document}

In the typeset document all lines in the verbatim are labeled with the
number 4, instead of 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Is this a known issue with the fancyvrb package? Any hints on how to get
verbatim numbered lines with UseVerbatim?

Regards,

Romildo

Actually, it's a well-known behavior that's easy to reproduce. Just save and load/revert the following file:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}
\begin{document}

\end{document}

This is a convenience feature for Babel users. It is only activated when the file contains \usepackage{babel} while being loaded. I think it already existed in 11.85.

Subject: [texhax] How to put space characters at the beginning of a line?
Message-ID: <20100427110702.GA25594@malaquias.DHCP-GERAL>

Hello.

I need to put space characters at the beginning of a line in a LaTeX
document. The problem is that neither '~' nor '\ ' works to achieve this
behaviour.

See the simplified document that illustrates the problem:

   \documentclass[a4paper]{article}

   \begin{document}

   \ttfamily\frenchspacing\noindent
   First~line\newline
   ~~Second~line

   \end{document}

Note that, when this document is compiled, the letter 'S' in the last
line aligns to the letter 'F' in the previous line. How can I get this
'S' aligned to the 'r' front the previous line?

This problem should be solved without using the verbatim (or similar)
environment.

Regards,

Romildo

Put something before the spaces which won't be discarded such as a strut:

  \documentclass[a4paper]{article}

  \begin{document}

  \ttfamily\frenchspacing\noindent
  First~line\newline
  \strut~~Second~line

  \end{document}

The other possibility is \hphantom{Fi} which will preciselyly line up 
the leading side bearing of the S with the leading side bearing of the r.
I can't remember whether you need a \leavevmode here or not.  It usually 
does no harm.

Message-ID: <20100427141434.GA28346@malaquias.DHCP-GERAL>

I want to set the background color of a set of consecutive lines. I am
using the \colorbox command from the color LaTeX package. 

  \documentclass[a5paper]{article}
  \usepackage{color}

  \newcommand{\cbox}[2]{%
    \colorbox{#1}{\makebox[\linewidth][l]{#2}}}

  \begin{document}

  \noindent
  \cbox{yellow}{First~line}\newline
  \cbox{yellow}{Second line}\newline
  \cbox{yellow}{}\newline
  \cbox{yellow}{Fourth line}

  \end{document}

The result of running pdflatex with this document is attached.

The problem I want to solve is the small blank space between each
line. How can it be eliminated?

Typesetting the lines in a minipage (or similar) environment is not an
option, as the sequence of lines should not be restricted to a single
page.

Regards.

The easiest (and less cleanest;-)) is probably to do it "by hand", by
replacing "\newline" by "\\[-1pt]" (this reduces the linespacing by
1pt - than it works correctly, except for the empty line, where the
colorbox is not high enough. To correct that, you could write
   \newcommand{\cbox}[2]{%
     \colorbox{#1}{\makebox[\linewidth][l]{\vphantom{F}#2}}}
in order to guarantee that the box has the necessary height:

  \documentclass[a5paper]{article}
  \usepackage{color}
  \newcommand{\cbox}[2]{%
    \colorbox{#1}{\makebox[\linewidth][l]{\vphantom{F}#2}}}
  \begin{document}
  \noindent
  \cbox{yellow}{First~line}\\[-1pt]
  \cbox{yellow}{Second line}\\[-1pt]
  \cbox{yellow}{}\\[-1pt]
  \cbox{yellow}{Fourth line}
  \end{document}

works for me. Of course, you could include the "\\[-1pt]" as last
element into your \cbox-command.

However, you will have a problem when there are paragraphs in the text:
there, LaTeX adds an additional vertical space (\parskip) - you will
have to treat that separately when it appears in your text?

There is no need to attach files. We all can compile documents too

so you want verbatim without the verbatim environment, but don't explain
what you don't like about the environment.

how about copying the code of the verbatim environment?

verbatim text in tex is notoriously tricky, which is why the verbatim
environment is so complicated.  there are various scraps of verbatim
code on the macros/plain and macros/generic trees on ctan; iirc there's
one in the texbook, too.  all those that work will have essentially the
same code as the verbatim environment.  (the \obeyspaces, \obeylines stuff.)

Hi folks,
Could you please tell me what the dagger macro is doing in the document below?

By the way, in case you were wondering about the weird LaTeX, it was 
produced using an OCR engine ( inftyreader ) designed for converting 
maths to LaTeX.

NUMBERS: BIG, BIGGER, AND BIGG ER AGAI N [!]
{\bf QUIZ 1}: {\bf Every number ever seen by any person is small}.
Is this statement true[?]

1. Which number is bigger: $333,33\times 444,444$ or $222,222\times 
666,667$ [?] What is the

2. Which number is bigger, (50-17) (50[+]17) or $50^{2}$[?]
3. If we write all of the digits of the two numbers $2^{2008}$ and 
$5^{2008}$ in a row, how
many digits will there be[?]

Have you ever seen a symbol like 5 [!] [?] We use it to denote the 
product of all consecutive
integers from 1 through 5: $5!=1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5$. So 
5[!] is not very big, right[?]
What about 10[!][?] Well, it's not too big, either: $10!=3,628,800$. But $20!=$
2,432,902,008,176,640,000. Looks kind of big, does it[?] Do you want

{\bf Whieh are bigger, faetorials or powers}[?]
As with factorials above, powers don't look too big in the beginning: 
$2^{2}=4,2^{10}=1024$.
But $2^{50}$ is already so big that if you use a number line with the 
scale of 1 millimeter, the
distance from 0 to $2^{50}$ will be about 1,125,899,906 
$\mathrm{km}$, which is about 7.5 times farther
than the distance from the Earth to the Sun[!]
{\bf Whieh is bigger}:
10. (a) 100[!] or $100^{100}$
(b) 100[!] or $2^{100}$
(c) 100 [!] or 3100
(d) 100[!] or $10^{100}$
(e) Can you find an integer $\mathrm{n}$ such that 
$n^{100}<100!<(n+1)^{100}$ [?]
11. 99[!] or $50^{99}$ [?] (Hint: look back at the warm-up problem 
involving 50)
12. 100[!] or $50^{100}$
13. $2^{100\dagger}$ or $(2^{100})!$
14. Consider the number 32[!] Which prime numbers divide it[?] It is 
obviously even,
but what is the largest power of 2 that divides 32[!] [?] What is the 
largest power of 3
that divides it[?] the largest power of 5[?] of 7[?] If you continue 
answering similar
questions about consecutive primes, you will finally write 32[!] as a 
product of
prime numbers (similarly to writing, say, $180=2^{2}\cdot 3^{2}\cdot 5$).
15. Which is bigger: $2^{5^{1}}$ or $(2^{5})!$ [?] (Hint: use the 
previous problem.)
16. Generalize Problem 12 and compare $n!$ with $(n\mathit{1}2)^{n}$

it produces a dagger symbol.  (surprise!)

incidentally, posting a large, dense, document to ask a question about a
single occurrence of a macro in the document, is hardly an optimal way
of using people's time.

I am working on some changes to the minted LaTeX package.  This package
is used to highlight source code snippets in a LaTeX document. It uses
the Pygments external project to do actual highlighting.

Environments similar to verbatim from the fancyvrb package are used to
insert the highlighted source code snippets into the final document.
But the explicit use of those environments are making some features
very hard to deal with. So I want to explore other options. That is
the reason I currently want to avoid them.

Basically the contents of minted environment are scanned using some
macros from the fancyvrb package and saved to an auxiliary file. Then an
external program process the auxiliary file doing the highlighting of
those code snippets, generating a second auxiliary file. In the next run
of LaTeX those highlighted code snippets are inserted back into the
document. I am have difficulties doing some formatting at these stage.

In the second auxiliary file, which is a LaTeX package itself, each
highlighted code snippet is implemented as a saved verbatim, which is a
feature from the fancyvrb package. Then, at the second pass through
LaTeX, these saved verbatim are put at the right spot using the
environment UseVerbatim from fancyvrb.

With this procedure, there are some problems. For instance, line
numbered (also a feature from the fancyvrb) does not work. All lines are
numbered equal, using the number of the last line for all lines of the
code snippet.

I hope this make it more clear what I am dealing with.

Unkind.  Just as I remember.  I thought Robin quit this list, when he decided that the frustration of
questions grew too tiresome, and the rest of the list didn't rally to his defense.  Ah yes, here's the
thread:

http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2005-November/thread.html#4901

Be sure to scroll to the bit where he calls Uwe L?ck a toad.

I wonder how much more unkindess we're in for, or how much more frustration you'll accept deriding
those who ask questions, simply because they desire to know the answer.

Welcome back.

last time, jonathan fine got up a campaign against me.  jonathan, are

Without wishing to name names, there are a small
number of well-informed contributors to this list
who (for whatever reason) respond from time to
time in a manner that I think many of us regard
as unnecessarily aggressive.  I do not think
anyone would benefit if those contributors were
to cease their contributions, but like many others,
I also think that their contributions would be

Yeah, Robin is not a mother Teresa for sure but sharpening \dagger for
5 years is not also a behaviour of the Great Humanitarian.

Returning to the original question: "What \dagger does in this
document"? Robin's answer was very mathematical in the sense of the
following joke:

"Two guys were flying on the balloon above clouds and could not find
out their location. Suddenly there was an opening and they asked to a
man staying on the hilltop - 'Where are we?' Thinking few seconds the
man answered - 'On the balloon!' - 'This guy is a mathematician' -
said one of the travellers - 'as he answered after consideration, his
answer was absolutely precise and completely useless in the same
time'".

Let us recall where this insane LaTeX document came from. It was
generated by some OCR engine (I will try to compile it just for a )
and it was in expression asking to compare $2^{100\dagger}$ and
$(2^{100})!$. In this case the whole content matters - and my answer
is that most likely it was an OCR error and it should  be $2^{100!}$.
Sure it could be a reference note sign but it does not seem to be
likely.

Well, that's downright false: I for one "rallied" and so did others.

Whatever one might feel about Robin's approach, it appears to me rather odd
that you should be urged to drag up such a long-forgotten episode - the
words you quote were used over four and a half years ago and should have
remained buried there - why stir it all up again?

As to the case at hand, the poster (who is no newbie to the list) asked a
question he could have answered himself by merely looking at the output.
Given that, I'd rate Robin's remarks as nothing more that a gentle prod, but
then my skin is perhaps just a little thicker than others'.  However, I have
tacked on at then end of this posting the reply by Robin that sparked off
the first episode - for the life of me I just cannot see the unkindness.
Indeed, I found Uwe's reply far more out of proportion, just as now I find
Brock's (who apparently doesn't even bother to sign his postings.

Cheers all (especially to Robin),  Phil

it's fairly obvious you've got something completely broken up there,

produce a minimal example, and there's a good chance someone will
help.

Just to clarify: The poster can not, in fact, answer his question by
looking at the output -- he's blind.

There is an extended variant of the joke:

sadly, i failed to read back on the op's posting history.  i'm an old
man, an my memory for names is pretty far gone.

in future, perhaps, i ought to scan all of the texhax archives before
posting: that would keep me quiet, which is no doubt what some people
would wish.  (probably uwe lueck, for example.)

i am duly chastened.  fancy forgetting the name of someone who posted
two years ago at a time when i couldn't post because i felt i was not
wanted here.

to avoid further embarrassment, i'll see if i can dissuade karl berry
from advertising my faq in the footer lines of texhax posts.

sorry about this.  i'm sorry that my postings, even when attempting to
be supportive, create so much dissension.

i shall sign off the list forthwith.  (i had been reading it via a
mail-to-news feed, but that's died despite my best efforts as
departmental postmaster.)

I'm sorry if my original message offended anyone. I have been on this 
list for over a year or so and I thought everyone knew about me being 
blind; I have mentioned my sight impairment on many occasions and in 
fact we've had a few threads on making LaTeX documentation more 
usable to the blind.
At any rate, if questions such as the one I posted in my previous 
message contravene list protocol then I will try finding a different 
forum for my future queries.

Many thanks, Paul

Oh no, I've done it again (i.e. it's not the first time I've made this
blunder).

My apologies.  Maybe it'll stick in my head from now on.

Anyway, does this really mean that there's no standard (La)TeX reference
guide that's of any use to a blind person?  How would they learn to use
\cdot, \otimes or \small, for example?

Cheers,  Phil

Robin (and I) were missing this information, which made you sound like
a troll. So you got the response a troll would get.

So please stay, but in the future include such important information

The only protocol is: try to do minimal examples as much as possible, 
and if you can't just say so. I for one didn't read your original 
message because the document was so large indeed. Such a "protocol" 
you'll have to respect on any TeX-related list, I suppose. That's what 
Robin tried to tell you, with perhaps a little irony or grumpiness or 
annoyance or whatever, anyway nothing so outright comdemnable as to be 
denounced by some masked avenger.

I tried to answer the original question: most likely it was an OCR error

I should notice that the OCR engine often reads "e" instead of "c".
Probably language tools are not working properly to correct the error.
Too many times it outputs [!] instead of ! and [?] instead of ?

Also while latex source processes properly the output is very ugly.
However may be output should be of completely different nature -
voice?

It would be VERY helpful if the original document (before OCR) was
also posted and the question was formulated more explicitly.

Yes, apologies.  It's all explained in section 5.4.1.2 of the TeXInfo
pages for AucTeX.  It's not entirely easy to reproduce, firstly
because it depends on the options given to \usepackage{babel}, and
secondly because there's a filename-dependence - e.g. try calling
Philipp's minimal example "index.tex": AucTeX then doesn't do the
hyphen conversion; whereas it does if you call the file "ondex.tex".
That explains why I haven't seen it before: I call most of my
hand-edited LaTeX documents "index.tex".

Just a vote from another one, hoping to convince you: 
There is no list protocoll like this. Many readers of the list hope that answers are friendly and welcome postings like yours, Paul. (So some would like to sign Philip Taylor's recent posting on "list etiquette".)

"TeX for the blind" is an especially interesting matter. You should remember some friendly answers you received earlier (I am just thinking of Paul Taylor and Barbara Beeton).

Cheers,

Friends, please, cool down a bit.

OK, Robin did not understand what really was the question. His answer was
off mark -- mind you, not necessarily unkind, just off the mark.

But, friends, this happens every day! It might be annoying, but why all the
hubub about it?

This is email. Even face to face there's so many ways to be misread, and
email lacks a lot of the communication channels face to face communication
holds. Please keep that in mind before second-guessing! (And the last one
goes to *all* sides in this controversy!)

And please keep in mind that, even though an answer might carry some
annoyance with it, it's still an answer. The poster spent the time reading
the question and answering it. It might not be a helpful answer, but it
still *is* an answer, usually given in good faith. It's unfair to discard
it just because it's not helpful -- maybe the answer is not, but the poster
still tried to be!

I did not address you as a friend by chance. Please keep in mind all
regular readers of this list are at least friends once removed, connected
by a wonderful program suite called TeX.

Just my thoughts (or, more precisely, an attempt at expressing them),

we have a book that includes a small

rather than sorting them into "alphabetical"

i have checked the archives of texhax and

Surely.

If an index entry has the form A at B, then the entry is sorted
according to A, but B is actually printed.

Try this quick hack:

\let\oldindex=\index
\renewcommand{\index}[1]{\oldindex{\thepage@#1}}

I didn't think it wise to pursue the query after the initial 
response, but that's all water under the bridge now.

The problem had been caused by a water mark or some such thing in the 
original tif document, resulting in the "!" symbol  for the factorial 
) to appear as a dagger.
Incidentally, i would like to publically thank David Romano for 
solving the mystery.

I'm sorry, martin, but I would have to disagree with you: troll-like 
behaviour is markedly different to my query. Whether the question 
fell outside the scope of this mailing list is a different issue 
which I believe has been addressed already.

I agree totally.  The main problem in the reply was the word
(surprise!).  Otherwise it just reworded part of the list guidelines.
I did not read the original post because of its length and complexity.
 I might have read a better phrased question.  It is perhaps to
Robin's credit that he tried to answer the question.  It is obvious
that he  had not full knowledge of the circumstances of the question.

Best regards

John

Subject: [texhax] \includepdf and A1 page
Message-ID: <op.vbwysuvxtpjj8f@lpr>

Hello,

I have the following problem:

I have a pdf of A1 size, i.e. 4x2 A4 (width x height).

I'd like to put it to A3 paper.

I'm trying to use \pdfpages package for it; unfortunately, I'm not able to get the desired effect.

When I used \includepdf[fitpaper,scale=.5]{OP1-P.pdf} (only one page), the original pdf is scaled in such way that A1 becomes A3 (4x2 A4 -> 2x1 A4) - that's OK.

But the page size keeps the original size of the pdf, that is A1! - That's unwanted.

Any idea how to solve the problem?

- Maybe I could use \includegraphis instead of \includepdf; but I cannot (= don't know how to) switch successfully to A3 (landscape), reset page margins to zero, put the pdf on the page and restore the original lengths (paper size and margins) after that.

Thank you in advance.

Regards,

Lukas


(NB: Sorry if anyone read and solved similar problem on CSTUG; I tried to find the solution (if it exists) but I wasn't successful.)

Well then why do you use the option fitpaper?
>From the documentation:
fitpaper: Adjusts the paper size to the one of the inserted
document.

I also doubt that you need the scale option. pdfpages scales pages
to the page size of the document automatically.

A trivial answer, or a work-around for some, pointed out to me at the monthly Munich TeX meeting: use hyperref's pdfstartpage option:

    http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-100003.6

... just increment the starting page number once in a while ...

Thanks.  I put links from my atchange and latex page to that.

That's interesting.  The problem is of course how to direct the PDF to
the page that corresponds to the spot I'm looking at in vim.  I can
get vim to write out the current line number, but LaTeX would have to
be involved to find the spot.

The solution with skim works very smoothly.  One does have to move
skim to the right spot, but it stays there and updates when the PDF
changes.

I didn't know about that - very cool.

I have an unusual system though and it's not clear from the page if
this is possible.  I use ssh to link to a main computer and then
transmit the PDF to another computer where I display it.  So the
question is whether I could transmit the information across too.  This
would mean that the instructions to the PDF viewer (skim) would have
to be in a file (preferably as plain text).  (I don't like to use X
windows displays as they are too slow.)

FYI ... I discussed this with Robin and persuaded him that it was ok for

especially new users.  I want to "advertise" it.

(Robin asked me to post this resolution.  He chose not to stay on the

I've searched all over to try to find out how to create a list of effective pages with a corresponding revision number but can't locate it.  How do I create a list of effective pages in LaTeX?

Thanks,

could you provide more information about what exactly it is you mean?

I know in the memoir class the number of pages used (independently of 
any change to the page counter) is saved in the lastsheet counter.

But I don't know what you mean by

"effective pages with a corresponding revision number"

Subject: [texhax] can't produce a footnote within a footnote using the
	manyfoot package	in Latex
Message-ID: <t2w5f7f2bba1004301126ica1051c6k2861b168b307253e@mail.gmail.com>

Here is my attempt to produce a footnote within a footnote using the
manyfoot package in Latex:

\documentclass[12pt]{book}

\usepackage{manyfoot}
\DeclareNewFootnote{A}[Alph]

\begin{document}


before the war\footnote{outer footnote\footnoteA{nested footnote}}
 after
\end{document}




However I only I get one footnote, numbered with a superscript 1 and
at the end of it a superscript A promising but not delivering the
nested footnote:

1 outer footnote A

What I expect for footnotes is two footnotes, i.e.:

1 outer footnote A

A nested footnote

I have read the manyfoot.pdf documentation but can't figure out how to
do this. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to have any simple examples.

Thanks
George

[subject repeated:] can't produce a footnote within a footnote using the manyfoot package in Latex

No surprise!

(manyfoot uses the standard TeX approach of producing footnotes which does not support nesting footnotes. my answer is a sociological experiment as well ...)

However, 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/bigfoot

includes (as I understand the description) an attempt at nesting footnotes. (Yet I do not know how to use it.)

Thanks Uwe. Between Google search and "The Latex Companion Book" Ch. 3
I figured it out. It turns out I  don't need the manyfoot package.
Google Search pointed me at:?www.latex-project.org/guides/tlc2-ch3.pdf

In?Sec. 3.2.1 the authors write

LaTEX does not allow you to use a \footnote inside another \footnote
command, as is common in some disciplines. You can, however, use the
\footnotemark command inside the first footnote and then put the text of the
footnote?s footnote as the argument of a \footnotetext command.

then they given an example of text with a footnote where the footnote
has a footnote

Some\footnote{A sample\footnotemark{}
footnote.}\footnotetext{A subfootnote.}
text and some more text.

Sorry to bother everybody. Hopefully this will be of use to others.
Thanks
George
