    I tried complete installing of MikTeX 2.8.3541 and it always says
    gatech-thesis.cab could not be verified. 

Thanks for the report.  This bug should be reported to the miktex
maintainers.  I'll forward this one, but for the future, please see
miktex.org for info.

Best,

Try \underbar{} instead of \underline{}; also try in math mode ($...$).  One of the four uses may be what you want.

Ok, ?I have learned enough Beamer to be dangerous and in response to
student complaints about all the slides the \pause feature generates
in a resulting .pdf file, I finally was able to use the article
command:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{beamerarticle}

which generally works. ?In those cases where I have large side by side
tables or images in succession the latter materials tend to trail off
the side of the page - I assume because I have not modifed them to
adjust for the change from landscape to portrait.

However, I still find it irritating when trying to page through a deck
and find the complete slide of a 50+ slide lecture that easily has 200
actual pdf slides.

Is there a command that one can use to selectively ignore all the
\pause commands when producing the .pdf so you can just get complete
slides for non presentation uses?

Thanks very much,
Tom

How about

\renewcommand\pause{}

Or something similar?

Hi Steve, and sorry for my slow response on this... This was very
valuable information, thanks a lot! Let's hope that embedding videos

I think you should not use \maketitle for this purpose, you should just use \includeonly. 

In order to get separate proof files for each chapter, you could have tiny files named something like `myrepchX.tex' 
calling a shared `myrep.tex'. The latter is a LaTeX main document file with 

    \includeonly{\includechap}

in its preamble, and the content of `myrepchX.tex' just is

    \newcommand{\includechap}{chapX}
    \input{\myrep}

`X' is meant to be a placeholder for a chapter id. 

So each "title page" is simply the starting page of a chapter exactly as in the final report version. 

Maybe I missed something?

HTH though -- Uwe.

But how does that fill the content of \title{...} with what already  
exists in \chapter{...} in the inputted file?

For example the header file looks like:

\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{report}


\author{Alan Litchfield}
\title{<I want the chapter text to appear here in the output>}
\date{\today}


\begin{document}

\maketitle

\input{includes/production}

\renewcommand\bibname{References}
\bibliographystyle{apacite}
\bibliography{SemanticsOfWork}

\end{document}


And where production.tex looks like

\chapter{Work as the means to production}
\section{Introduction}
\nobreak
blahblahblah

?? I am saying that you shouldn't think of \title and \maketitle here. 

> For example the header file looks like:
>
> \documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{report}
>
> \author{Alan Litchfield}
> \title{}

Your report should have a title ... a single title for the whole report, 
nothing to do with chapter title pages!

> \date{\today}
>
> \begin{document}
> \maketitle

I consider this wrong, better 

    \include{frontmat}

and `frontmat.tex' contains \maketitle. 

> \input{includes/production}

What is this good for? I expect something like \include{production}.

> \renewcommand\bibname{References}
> \bibliographystyle{apacite}
> \bibliography{SemanticsOfWork}

I think this should be in a file `backmat.tex' that you should \include(only). 

> \end{document}
>
> And where production.tex looks like
>
> \chapter{Work as the means to production}
> \section{Introduction}

?? -- Again I think you must use \include{production}

You have not taken note of the context in which I am working. These  
are draft chapters only. This is not the whole document.

I don't know what you are going on about with chapter title pages. I  
have never suggested that is what I want. In the chapter draft there  
is to be a title page that includes the current date and the name of  
the chapter. On he next page there is to be the draft of the chapter.

Do not tell me what you think I should have. I know what I want. What  
I want to know is how to get there. If that is not possible then fine,  
I can live with that.

    \author{Alan T. Litchfield}
    \begin{document}

included file:

    \chapter{...}\label{ch:X}

I really tested the \nameref thing, not having found an explicit statement on how to use \nameref. 

You may get errors in the first or second run, then just try again, third run should be fine.

I had not thought of that approach at all! :)

Often it is the simplest solution that escapes us.

What I have done though, from a suggestion from Peter Zimmerman, is  
this:

I have put this into the draft chapter header file preamble:

\providecommand{\myChapter}[1]{\title{Draft chapter \\ #1}
                                                  \date{\today}
                                                  \author{Alan  
Litchfield}
                                                  \maketitle
                                                  \chapter{#1}}

In the custom class file based on report.cls I have now added:

\providecommand{\myChapter}[1]{\chapter{#1}}

Then in all the chapters \chapter{...} has been replaced with  
\myChapter{...}

So that I can produce random drafts and when the whole job is run it  
will still work, producing chapter counters and a table of contents.  
Hopefully nothing will be messed up by this but it seems to work for  
now.

This all means I do not have to remember to change anything between  
drafts and overall processing.

> HTH really -- Uwe.

It does. Thank you.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=4XpNbbiJzUoLjPZbUpVQ5-c1smOQHZ5dWGU=1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

If you create these two files, t.tex and i.tex

----- t.tex -----
\documentclass{article}
\newcommand{\text}[1]{#1}
\begin{document}
X\input{i}X
\end{document}
-----------------

----- i.tex -----
\text{test}
-----------------

the result will look like this:

Xtest X

i.e. there is an extra space where it (IMHO) shouldn't be. I can't see
how I instructed LaTeX to insert it. Is this behaviour intentional and
how can I avoid it?

Thank you in advance,
Alex

Message-ID: <AANLkTimUCWfuU1PNjJu3JdqVBTf4A7fZ-SY4OquWxEes@mail.gmail.com>

Hello again,

I have a book with plain text and footnotes, with \parskip=0pt.

A simple question: is it possible to have something like "stretchable
\baselineskip" for normaltext? I.e. can I instruct LaTeX to always
vertically stretch all normal lines that appear on a given page, in
order to eliminate any white space (at the bottom of the page or
before footnotes block)?

Strange, but it seems to me that a simple answer to this doesn't
exist... Am I right?

Thank you,
Alex

Put a % after the \text{test} command.  This will suppress the space
inserted by the new-line character.

Thank you, Kevin (and all that replied off-list), this works! However,
I still don't understand because there is no newline in the file. Try

echo -n "test" > i.tex

i.e. no newline; the extra space is still there.

1. plain TeX: \advance\baselineskip 0pt plus 1pt; 
LaTeX: \addtolength{\baselineskip}{0pt plus 1pt} with \flushbottom. 

2. However, \baselineskip is reset with every \normalsize. 
bk12.clo, e.g., has 
\renewcommand\normalsize{%
 \@setfontsize\normalsize\@xiipt{14.5}%
  ...

copy the entire definition between \makeatletter ... \makeatother 
and replace {14.5} by {14.5 \@plus 1pt}

... do you see a difference?

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

If TeX reads a line it first strips <CR> and <LF> from the end
(also spaces are removed at the end of line). Then TeX inserts
the character denoted by \endlinechar at the end of the line.
Usually \endlinechar is 13, that means that <CR> or ^^M is inserted.
In LaTeX and plain TeX that character has catcode 5 (end of line)
that behaves like a space in most circumstances.

The addition of the end of line character does not depend on
the original line ending. With \endlinechar=-1 the addition
of the end line character is suppressed. The percent sign
above puts the end of line character in a comment.

BTW, this line reading behaviour is the main reason, why TeX
cannot be used for reading binary files.

Yours sincerely

Or \set at fontsize could be overloaded for this, e.g.:

\makeatletter
\let\org at set@fontsize\set at fontsize
\def\set at fontsize#1#2#3{%
  \@defaultunits\@tempskipa#3pt\relax\@nnil
  % \advance\@tempskipa by 0pt\@plus 1pt\relax
  \advance\@tempskipa by 0pt\@plus .2\@tempskipa\relax
  \expandafter\set at fontsize@i\the\@tempskipa\@nil{#1}{#2}%
}
\def\set at fontsize@i#1\@nil#2#3{%
  \org at set@fontsize{#2}{#3}{#1}%
}
\makeatother

  \text{test}\relax

If insufficient, then try

  ----- i.tex -----
  \text{test}\endinput

anyway, I doubt my `14.5 \@plus 1pt'; however, I cannot correct it right now.

Hi Uwe and Heiko,

Thank you very much, both methods work! These are exactly what I was
looking for. First, please find my test file. Two questions about
these methods are below.

--------- p.tex ----------
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{blindtext}
\begin{document}
\flushbottom
\blindtext\footnote{\blindtext}\par
\blindtext\par

  footnotes\footnote{\blindtext}.\par

\blindtext\par
\blindtext\par

\end{document}
-------------------------

I used larger numbers for this test, i.e. {14.5pt \@plus 10pt} and
\@plus 4\@tempskipa.

Pages 1 and 3 are typical examples where I need vertical stretching.

1. In Heiko's method, all lines are proportionally stretched,
including footnotes; is there a way to restrict this behaviour on
\normal- or any other size?

2. For both methods: is there a way to change plus and minus factor on
a specific page *only* (not between paragraphs)?

Thank you again,
Alex

See the code:

  % \advance\@tempskipa by 0pt\@plus 1pt\relax
  \advance\@tempskipa by 0pt\@plus .2\@tempskipa\relax   

The first line uses the non-proportional, the second
line the proportinal method. Set the percent char in the
line with the method you don't want to use.

> including footnotes; is there a way to restrict this behaviour on

  % \@tempskipa contains the original baseskip
  \ifdim\@tempskipa>10pt
    \advance\@tempskipa by 0pt\@plus .2\@tempskipa\relax
  \fi

> 2. For both methods: is there a way to change plus and minus factor on

Not in general, because the page break is done by the
output routine that is called asynchronous. At paragraph building time
the baselineskip is evaluated, but it is not known on which page
each line will end up.

But you can surround your page with \newpage and use a differnt
baselineskip setting inbetween.

Yours sincerely

Subject: [texhax] Import JPG pictures into LaTeX
Message-ID: <A1BDBB72AD4D4BFBB4D58C7F19F447E6@DN>

Dear Sir,

I was using LaTeX in the years of 1988-2003.
Now I want to use it again. Installed MiKTeX and I am progressing well.
One of my problems now is to include graphics with colors.
I have no problem to use EPS, or convert from other format into EPS.
However I would like to know if it is possible to use JPG files DIRECTLY
without converting them into EPS format.

I took to import a color JPG file, but it shows up as a gray picture.
Conclusion? It seems possible, but I may miss some usepackage!

I would like to have some help [to phone somebody?]

Yours truly,

Dezso Nagy

Hi, 

I'm really not having much compiling a document in winedt6 luck as I believe there is an issue with hyperref.sty package

I have always been able to compile documents using the following preamble:

\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,euscript,epsfig,graphics}
\usepackage[dcucite]{harvard}

\usepackage{pdftex}
\usepackage{graphicx}
%\theoremstyle{plain}
%\def\marginpar#1{}
\singlespacing
\makeatletter \@mparswitchfalse \makeatother
\textheight=574pt
\textwidth=452pt
\oddsidemargin=0pt
\evensidemargin=0pt
\parindent=0pt
\parskip=10pt
\topmargin=14.21pt
\headheight=6.15pt
\def\baselinestretch{1.05}
\setlength{\parindent}{0mm}


However, I'm getting errors based on the file hyperref.sty

Is there any way you can assist as I am stuck on a document that wont compile for Friday!

Thank you,
Lisa.

Message-ID: <51885.158.144.67.189.1286535400.squirrel@www1.math.binghamton.edu>

Hello All,

          I have a latex question. Suppose i am in section two of my latex
document and within section two i am in Proposition 2.10. Now i
want to write two equations within Proposition 2.10 and want to
number them as (2.10.1) and (2.10.2). The only way i know to do
that right now is use \tag command. But the problem with this is
that if in the future i realize that i have to add a corollary
just before Proposition 2.10, then Proposition 2.10 is
automatically changed to Proposition 2.11 but my equations are
still numbered (2.10.1) and (2.10.2), which ofcourse i want to
avoid. So is there a way that the 3rd counter is changed
automatically in latex?

Thank you in Advance
Viji Thomas

TeX/LaTeX can and have only ever been able to handle EPS format.

With pdfLaTeX it is possible to use directly other formats.

N.B. the peferred way is using \includegraphics[<options>{<filename>}

Message-ID: <4CAF55BF.4070902@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I have a document that
? compiles fine
? looks fine
? opens fine in a pdf-viewer.

At least running Linux. On a windows machine, the pdf seems to be
horribly broken. In one viewer, the letters E and u are just missing
everywhere. Another viewer (one was evince, one AcrobatReader) didn?t
show the correct formatting in some parts. Both viewers did not show
about 4 or 5 pages but just tiny squares instead of them.

I don?t have a windows copy here so I cannot test anything. Would it be
possible for anyone to have a look at the following document:

http://github.com/alt/tex-overview/raw/b446b0825d7a7f159b92d179ab8a8f9057564bc4/tex-overview.pdf

or under

http://github.com/alt/tex-overview/blob/master/tex-overview.pdf ? view raw

As this document should go on CTAN the next days it would be great if
windows users also could view it ?
Mac users are also welcome to test the document ;)

I would be happy about any report or suggestion how to improve the
situation ?

cheers
Arno

That's what happens under Windows with Acrobat, but not with Sumatra, 
where it seems to be displayed correctly. So it's more likely to be a 
problem with readers rather than OS.
I must say that Acrobat is supposed to be the most pdf-compliant reader. 
You probably know the reason why.

Nice document, by the way. I hope you know iTeX was a joke?

Best,
Paul

Correction: even under Sumatra, the section on distributions doesn't 
show up (and the pages making it up aren't even counted, so the document 
is only 21 pages long instead of 25).
I guess you should try to produce a version without changing page sizes.

Paul

Mac OS X Acrobat 8.1.0 at page 10 says "There was a problem reading
this document (14)" in a popup window.  That and following pages show
a white rectangle on a grey background up to page 18.  Page 19 on are
ok.

Skim is slow at page 4 but does display everything.

Even under Linux, the endash and the appostrophe appear wrong in the bookmarks. 

Only in the past year I have learnt how to get good bookmarks with \pdfstringdefDisableCommands. 
I would suggest using \textendash and some \apostrophe in the titles and then perhaps 
\pdfstringdefDisableCommands{\def\textendash{-}\def\apostrophe{\rq}}

Heiko may know something better.

Yes, that is no viewer problem but in the pdf itself. But to be honest,
I don?t care about the bookmarks here as they are not of great use.
Furthermore, if I enter a unicode character to a unicode-aware engine
(typeset using luaTeX) and it does not come out as such, I first
consider this to be a bug. But I don?t blame anyone for it as I didn?t
try to solve it anyways.

That?s not a nice way ?

Darn. We have a case of copyright infringement, then. Or copyleft 
infringement.

More seriously, that Instant TeX is missing in Arno's file.

Which file I can't uncompress with pdftk. Would you please produce it 
again, Arno, with \pdfcompresslevel=0 at the very beginning?

Paul

It seems to be a shell script. That does not qualify it for a TeX
engine, does it?

No. First, why should I? (Honestly, I don?t understand what you want to
do.) Second, the code is available, so do it yourself ? that?s why the
code is there for people who have extra wishes ;)

No. Image inclusion heavily depends on the output driver (dvips, dvipdfm(x),
PDF mode of pdfTeX, ...). For instance, dvips supports EPS, BMP, PCX, MSP
and can be configured to automatically convert other image file formats.

Usually JPEG files are converted using jpeg2ps to EPS files, jpeg2ps doesn't
change the image data, it only adds a PostScript wrapper to the image data.

Black and white screen, try a monitor with color support. ;-)
Seriously, whithout knowing, what you (OP) are doing, which driver
is used, ..., only guessing and speculation remains, but not real help.

JPEG, PNG, PDF, JBIG2

Usually EPS files are converted to PDF via "epstopdf" or "ps2pdf -dEPSCrop"
(both rely on or are part of Ghostscript).

* \usepackage[unicode]{bookmark}
  Then direct UTF-8 input is supported (via utf8.def or utf8x.def).
  Using lualatex I got the endash and the apostrophe in the bookmarks.

* \usepackage{bookmark}
  Then the bookmarks don't need two runs.
  I also prefer:
  \bookmarksetup{numbered}

Your PDF is errorneous, xpdf complains:
  Error (34318): Illegal character ')'
  Error (34318): Dictionary key must be a name object
  Error (40975): Illegal character ')'
  Error (40975): Dictionary key must be a name object
  Error (40975): Illegal character ')'
  Error (40975): Dictionary key must be a name object

When I compile the file using \pdfobjcompresslevel=0, then xpdf doesn't show
an error, however using \pdfobjcompresslevel=2 I got errors using xpdf:
  Error (35708): Dictionary key must be a name object
  Error (39036): Illegal character ')'
  Error (39039): Dictionary key must be a name object
Therefore I suspect a bug in luatex 0.63.0.
Workaround:
Disabling object compression of PDF-1.5:

\ifcsname pdfobjcompresslevel\endcsname
  \pdfobjcompresslevel=0
\fi

! Package xkeyval Error: `unicode' undefined in families `BKM'.

See the xkeyval package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

l.537 \ProcessKeyvalOptions*

> * \usepackage{bookmark}

With this, I get no erroneous bookmarks ? but I don?t get the apostrophy
at all. It is just omitted.
Am I missing any important point here?

This has a funny effect in Acrobat Reader: It does not solve the problem
but it adds a bar stating ?Please fill out the following form [?]?

However, xpdf does the same here: \pdfobjcompresslevel=0 doesn?t give
errors. So xpdf feels fine with that file, but Acrobat Reader actually
crashes badly at page 9.
I?ll try to reduce this to a minimal example by tomorrow, now just too
tired to do useful work.

Thanks to everybody helping me here!

Good night,
Arno

Maybe this file was created by Web2sh.

Is 

  http://github.com/alt/tex-overview/raw/master/tex-overview.pdf

the current version?  Pages 10--18 are not shown in AR-9 on Linux.

BTW, the TL package manager and network installer were introduced in
TL-2008.  The package manager is not MikTeX-like because it doesn't
install packages automatically on demand.

Just to get rid of some question marks in your document:

teTeX was a TeX distribution for Unix.  It was TDS compliant and
provided LaTeX2e from the beginning.  AFAIK, the very first release of
TeX Live provided teTeX only.  Then Fabrice Popineau ported teTeX to
Windows.  His distribution was called fpTeX.  All further releases of
TL were shipped with binaries for Windows.  Fabrice also provided
Windows binaries for Perl and ghostscript.  Some years ago Fabrice
left the TeX Live team and started a new project called XemTeX.  It
was a TeX distribution for Windows, based on fpTeX and with
XEmacs/AucTeX as an IDE for (La)TeX.  XemTeX was sponsored by the
French government.  Since Fabrice doesn't work on TeX Live anymore,
binaries for Windows are provided by Akira Kakuto, who is maintaining
his own TeX distribution for Windows, called W32TeX.  W32TeX provides
special support for Japanese.

  Reinhard

The error is caused by an unmatched parenthesis in:

 \tonode[\experimental](latex25)(0,\layer)<Will Robertson ... :) )>{\LaTeX2.5}
                                                               ^
I would consider it a bug in cooltooltips that does not take precautions
that arbitrary user contents might break PDF syntax.
You have already hyperref loaded, thus I would use \pdfstringdef
for conversion the description string to a PDF string:

\makeatletter
\renewcommand*{\ctip at make@Text}[3][0 1 0]{%
  \pdfstringdef\ctip at Subj{#2}%
  \pdfstringdef\ctip at Contents{#3}%
  \pdfannot width 0pt height 0pt depth 0pt {
    /Subtype /Text
    /C [#1]
    /Subj (\ctip at Subj)
    /Contents (\ctip at Contents)
    /NM (ctip Text \ctip at tip@number)
    /AP <<

      /D \ctip at empty@icon\space 0 R
      /R \ctip at empty@icon\space 0 R
    >>
    /Open false
  }%
}
\makeatother


While investigating I found other errors:

The third mandatory argument of \cooltooltip is a *URL*! You shouldn't
add the description there. Unhappily cooltooltip doesn't remove
the link annotation if the url is empty.

You are using the wrong character, here again in this mail, see my
previous answer.

I think the problem is rather the object compression of PDF-1.5
that can be turned off by
  \pdfobjcompresslevel=0

In case of XeTeX:
  xe(la)tex -output-driver='xdvipdfmx -V 4'

I don't know if you have already solved your problems, but, as Vafa says, you have to tell what error(s) you're getting.

Now ---if you allow me... The hyperref manual specifies that you should better load it after all your other packages:

> Make sure it comes *last* of your loaded packages, to give it a fighting chance of not being over-written, since its job is to redefine many LaTeX commands


which also means that if you have typeset your document *without* the hyperref package and then add it, it might encounter problems with your *.aux, *.toc, etc., files; see the bottom of this page (``Problems with already existing .toc, .lof and similar files''):

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Hyperlinks

If that's the case, delete them before typesetting with hyperref.

Also ---are you aware that you're loading several packages several times? To start with, I think amsart already loads amsmath, and you load it again two times; you load two times as well graphics and graphicx (use one or the other just once), etc.

See

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf

Finally, at least from TeXLive 2007 on, there is no pdftex.sty and I don't recall any from previous distributions.

You would have to clean the refworks output .bib file and make a proper .bst (bibliography style); but that would require you to learn the bibtex language, which obviously you can:

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/doc/

If you're in a hurry, better try the method shown in lshort.pdf:

I'd never investigated that one. The pdfTeX manual says it's 0 by 
default, but pdftexconfig.tex (in TeXLive) turns it to 2.

I tried many hours (several times) to understand what \pdfstringdef is good for 
from manual.pdf (without success). What effect has 

    \pdfstringdef{macroname}{TeXstring} 

for given macroname and TeXstring? I resorted to \pdfstringdefDisableCommands 
successfully, but still wonder if using \pdfstringdef could be more efficient. 

Now I see that hyperref.pdf is much clearer on \pdfstringdef. 
However, I still don't understand if/how I could profit from using it. 

\texorpdfstring looked very interesting, too, but I don't know what PDF strings are. 
May be the *macros* in the example can be generated with \pdfstringdef!?

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

It converts a TeX string <TeXstring> into a PDF string
that is stored in macro <macroname>.

> for given macroname and TeXstring? I resorted to

> \pdfstringdef could be more efficient.

\pdfstringdefDisableCommands is part of \pdfstringdef. It allows
the redefinition of TeX macros that are valid in TeX strings,
but unusable in PDF strings. Example: "\TeX" can be part of a
TeX string, in a PDF string "TeX" can be used instead.
  \pdfstringdefDisableCommands{%
    \def\TeX{TeX}%
  }%
However this is not necessary for \TeX, \LaTeX and some other
macros, because they are already known by \pdfstringdef.

See PDF specification about "text string":
* "3.2.3 String Objects"
* "3.8.1 String Types"

> May be the *macros* in the example can be generated with
> \pdfstringdef!?

The example uses:

  \pdfannot width 0pt height 0pt depth 0pt {
    /Subtype /Text
    ...
  }

The stuff beginning with "/Subtype" is raw PDF dictionary code
and reading section "3. Syntax" of PDF specification is
strongly recommended. A string object given there has
syntactical requirements. They are given, if the string
is passed through pdfTeX's \pdfescapestring or package
pdfescape's \EdefEscapeString, but I doubt that you want
to read TeX code as result. \pdfstringdef with \pdfstringdefDisableCommands
and \texorpdfstring helps in the conversion process from TeX code
to something more meaningful PDF string.

Yours sincerely

I've enquired on here for advice on how to fix my referencing on latex to
yield the preferred vancouver style I wish and not to include the 'note'
field in my finished references. As I am not a programmer of any sort I am
struggling to fix the error using advice from people, I am hoping to know if
there is anyone qualified that I would be able to send my template document
to, who may be able to correct the error for me. I realise this may take up
some time and of course I would happily pay a fee to a trusted service or
indeed give a donation to TUG.

I hope this spikes some interest.

Kind regards, David.

Hi David,

why don't you attach a small sample, illustrating your problem? Prepare a
full, working sample and i guess someone will pick it up to assist you.

In addition: If the only Problem is, that you don't want to see the
"note"-field: Assuming you are using bibtex, one easy solution would be
to open the file containing your references (the .bib-file) and remove
there by hand all notes. This are the lines like:
note = { This the text of the note }
Once you removed them and rerun "bibtex" and "latex", all Notes will 
disappear from your file of course :-)

or, if you don't want to change your reference' file : 
Assuming you use bibtex and the "vancouver"-style: you can make a copy
of the file "vancouver.bst" (which will be somewhere in your
tex-installation) into the directory where your tex-file is stored. This
file defines how bibtex treates the data to create the citations. The
"note" filed ist formated by a function 
FUNCTION {format.note}
{
 ...
}

If you replace this function in the copied file by

FUNCTION {format.note}
{
 {""}
}

it will always return an empty string -- the notes disappear from your
final file.

Dear David,

Your TeX file contains the line

\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat} % Use the "unsrtnat" BibTeX style


What happens if you change this to

\bibliographystyle{vancouver}

then rerun BibTeX and pdflatex?

David,

You are asking for someone to sort it out for you?? I think, as Axel  
suggested, you put in a little more effort yourself first. Learn  
something about bibtex.

No, David is offering to pay someone to sort it out,
or to make a donation to TUG [1].  Both of those seem
very reasonable to me, and I would offer to help
myself if I knew the first thing about BibTeX.

OK, Sorry I misread the archive. My apologies.

Nevertheless, it pays to learn about bibtex and by deleting the note  
field all that extraneous bumph in the output will be gone :)

Better than deleting possibly useful information, you can just change
the name from note to 'comment'.  Then it won't appear but you can
retain the original information.  On the other hand, I would probably
throw away most of that but keep the PMC ID since that is a useful
pointer to the open source version of the paper!

For example:

@article{Zhang.Su2009,
author = "S. Zhang
 and M. Xu
 and S. Li
 and Z. Su",
title = "{Genome-wide \emph{de novo} prediction of cis-regulatory
binding sites in prokaryotes}",
journal = "Nucleic Acids Res.",
volume = "37",
pages = "e72",
pmid = "19383880",
pmcid = "PMC2691844",
year = "2009"}

Hi Karl, hi Ron,

would you consider 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/inputtrc

such a "filename backtrace utility"?

I just was about to do such a "backtracing" job and took one and a half day to implement such a thing as LaTeX macros ...

The internal filename stack (\IT at filestack) could be made publicly available, 
but I didn't have a clear idea about relevant practical use. 

And I cannot follow all of this (Ron):

Sure? TeX has a command \input. LaTeX has a command 
\input (different from TeX's \input) and a command \include. 
LaTeX has additional input commands: \documentclass, 
\LoadClass, ... \RequirePackage, \usepackage, ... 
\InputIfFileExists ...

Subject: [texhax] \includegraphics command is not working
Message-ID: <728875.87511.qm@web31705.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi

I am a new latex user. I am using MikTex 2.8 version and also using WinEdt 6.0 
version. I am using these under windows operating system. 


For some resaon the \includegraphics command is not working. Here I have 
attached a simple code that I have been using for testing. If I don't use any 
extension for the figure name, the code gives an error that the file is not 
found. The figure file is in the same folder that .tex file is. if I add the 
extension (.eps) to the figure name then it gives a new error that the extension 
is unknown. I don't have any clue why the command is not working. 


Any help is appreciable. 

Thanks

Mostafa

sounds like you are compiling using pdflatex (or similar) and they 
cannot handle eps files.

Only LaTeX (plus dvips or perhaps dvipdfm) can handle eps files.

Use the tool epstopdf to convert you eps to pdf and the include it with 
out extension, then pdflatex will pick up the PDF version and LaTeX will 
choose the eps version.

Hi all,

sorry for taking so long to answer but I was horribly busy this week ?
So: I could bring this down to the following minimal example. I included
Heiko's code, but that does not solve the problem. The error is raised
by Acrobat Reader (testing under Linux, I hope it behaves the same under
Windows) when using an unmatched parenthesis as stated by Heiko. Only
the third argument of cooltooltip makes trouble, the second one is fine.

I am using the second /and/ the third one, as all viewers I am using
only show the third (actually a URL) and not the second one ? which only
Acrobat Reader does show. Therefore I am looking for a solution to make
the third argument robust. Unfortunately, Heiko's Code does not help
here. Did I make any mistakes?

cheers
Arno

  Question: instead of Heiko's code, why not simply \pdfescapestring?

\cooltooltip{label}{description}{\pdfescapestring{more

works very well. Provided you use pdfTeX, that is.

Maybe because I?m a fool ? indeed, it works as expected.

> works very well. Provided you use pdfTeX, that is.

pdfTeX works. luaTeX does not. Which is strange because it should know
all pdfTeX primitives. But they may not be activated in luaLaTeX ?
stupid format, I know ? I have to look that up.

Well, actually, if Heiko didn't think of it, that might be because it's 
not such a good solution. So my question was rather directed at Heiko.
And I wouldn't call anybody a fool just because he/she doesn't think of 
\pdfescapestring. It's not like it's used very often. One may wonder, 
though, why it's not used in cooltooltips, and that's where I start 
thinking that might not be the better solution.

No, the primitive is disabled in LuaTeX, along with other primitives, 
probably because it can be mimicked with Lua. I can't see any good 
reason why the LuaTeX team chose to remove those primitives (even if 
they're mimickable), but, well, they did.

I love latex.
I normally can figure out just about anything but this situation I  
experiencing a problem in finding resources.

My situation is I am on a client-side computer and ssh into the root  
of a server. This server has latex on it. Each time I want to use  
latex I have to add the $PATH variable. I can't seem to find any  
documentation. The server is Centos/Apache and it would mean a great  
deal to make the $PATH variable into a permanent structure so I can  
run it using cron.

Thank you for any help,

What about not directly calling "latex", but using the complete path --
like "/opt/texliv/bin/latex" (or where your latex lives...) Would that
work?
If  not:
When using cron, you can redefine alle environment-Variables --
normally, it is sufficient to add a line like
"PATH=$PATH:/opt/texliv/bin/" in your crontab (But I don't use CentOS
myself).

A more general way:
If you have a root-Account on the Server: There should be a file
/etc/profile, which is executed at every login by most of the
user-shells. There you can also add/change the definition of PATH
Without a root-account: you can create a file ".profile" in your
home-directory (and in the home-directory of the user which runs "latex"
in the cron-job). There also you can redefine PATH permanently...

HTH,

Axel

This is deprecated.  This way latex will be found but other scripts
invoked by latex (for instance epstopdf) will be searched in standard
*/bin directories only.

How should this work at all?  It is only effective in the shell in
which the cron job is executed.

And even if it *would* work, it's not a good idea to steadily prepend
something to PATH without checking whether it's already there.

The most appropriate way is to prepend the dir to PATH in the personal
config file of the shell you are using or to ask the system admin to
do it system-wide.

Rergards,
  Reinhard

Hi folks
I thought I'd check with you chaps before asking for help from the XY forum.
anyone know a `user-friendly' package for modelling finite state machines?
I'm dealing with `finite automata' in particular.
The XY package can be used for drawing the arrows and the states. I'm 
looking for something a little less terse and cryptic. :)
Cheers
Paul

I've scanned in some books and have marked their pages with a counter called
`Page'.
TeX keeps this counter separate from `page'.
I'd like for the \index command to pick up `Page' instead of 'page'.

\index seems to be in the depths of TeX.  I hope there's a simple solution,
but I'm not holding out hope.

I think TikZ does a good job for that. Section 23 of the pgfmanual deals with Automata Drawing Library.

Hi Paul, 

when Juergen Fenn's topic index of the TeX Catalogue

    http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html

doesn't help (hi Juergen!), you can try

    http://ctan.tug.org/search.html

and enter something for "Search the package descriptions".

I entered "automata". The results are 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/automata

    http://ctan.org/pkg/finomaton

    http://ctan.org/pkg/gastex

    http://ctan.org/pkg/vaucanson-g

Entering "finite" in place of "automata" doesn't add ...

You may be unhappy with MetaPost or PSTricks. 

But, hey, entering "Turing" instead, you get

    http://ctan.org/pkg/jflap2tikz

somewhat in Axel's direction --

What does this mean? Do you have each book page as an image on a TeX page, with \includegraphi..., together with \refstepcounter{Page}? Or what does "marked with a counter" mean?

Or are you working with OCR extracts from the book pages?

> TeX keeps this counter separate from `page'.

No, it's LaTeX code.

If you are stepping `Page' by \stepcounter or \refstepcounter, you could try 

  \makeatletter
    \def\@wrindex#1{%
     \protected at write\@indexfile{}%
     {\string\indexentry{#1}{\thePage}}%
     \endgroup
     \@esphack}
  \makeatother

This would replace `page' by `Page' in an underlying LaTeX command. 

This may fail when you use a third-party index package. 

Another idea would to have your own \Index command, about as follows: 

  \newcommand*{\Index}[1]{{\let\thepage\thePage\index{#1}}}

Or if you have a package redefining \index so it has an optional argument ... the usual hacking ... may depend on that package ...

Or can't you use `page' in place of `Page' by some proper \setcounter{page}{...} for each book or even each page?

Curious: 

    Uwe

Subject: [texhax] minipage/parbox without pre-defining width
Message-ID: <20101018130212.GA6918@eureca.de>

Hi folks,

for a book I would like to reproduce, I would like to automate positioning
of a special kind of blocks.

Those are small blocks (with hard-coded linebreaks and without pagebreaks,
sometimes consisting of several small paragraphs) which should be centered
in themselves. They are quite a bit smaller than the main text. Then this
block is put nearly to the right edge of the main text block.

Positioning these blocks is solved. But right now I create the block by
using \parbox. This works, but I have to provide for the width of that
block, which up to now I only can do empirically. I would love to find a
way to automate this.

Ideally I look for some relative of minipage, where I can define a maximum
width, but which shrinks to the width its contents really occupies before
it is typeset.

This is where I got stuck. Any hints on how I could archieve that?

Thanks in advance,

	Susan Dittmar

I'll be happy to take this to the LaTeX mailing list.  I looked for it but
couldn't find it.  So, if someone could spin me around and point me in the
right direction \ldots

In reviewing my question, I saw that there were many unclosed issues.  Here
is a more complete description of the problem:

Here is my ``Page'' code:

\begin{document}

 \newcounter{Page}

 \newcommand{\Page}
{\addtocounter{Page}{1}\color{Blue}[\arabic{Page}]}
.
 .
  .
Latex source:
...luminous smile.
{\Page}%0044.tex
\index{Gnus!gnats!armadillos}
``I'm not depending...

pdflatex output:

luminous smile. [44]"I'm not depending

This reference occurs, and LaTeX indexes it, on page 21 of the .pdf.
Gnus
  gnats
    armadillos, 21

I'd like to see an index entry of,
Gnus
  gnats
    armadillos, 44.

OK, here's a tentative solution. I'll use a special \myindex command, so 
we don't mess with the normal \index.

\makeatletter
\def\myindex#1{%
   \immediate\write\@indexfile{%
     \noexpand\indexentry{#1}{\arabic{Page}}}%
}
\makeatother

Now \myindex{whatever} will add ``whatever'' to the index, but with page 
number Page.

There are more bells and whistles to the real \index command, but I'm no 
LaTeX user; the solution here should probably work in most cases, though.

Best,
Paul

Then my previous suggestions do apply, at least when you replace \index by \Index. 

In order to avoid this replacement, 

    \let\Index\index 

and interchange \index and \Index in my suggestions.

I should point out that Linux Adobe Reader (AR) has severe problems with 
the the playing of YouTube videos. Specifically, changing pages while a 
video is running can cause AR9.x to freeze and even crash. This year I've 
unearthed three AR vulnerabilites, acknowledged by Adobe, with more in the 
pipeline. I stumbled across them all in the process of exploring how 
/RichMedia annotations might be used to add computational rigour to a 
scientific document.

Unforuntately with the release of Linux AR9.4 Adobe have broken the 
SWF/JavaScript bridge thereby crippling some of the more interesting 
possibilities. The problem will doubtless be fixed in the fullnes of time, 
nevertheless it's clear that the /RichMedia technology has not yet bedded 
down.

As regards to portability, it should be noted that Linux AR is
stuck with FlashPlayer (FP) 9 whereas Windows and OSX ARs use FP10.
It should also be noted that the FP within AR has security
features, over and above the standard FP. For instance, SWF shared objects
are not allowed. Thus one has to be careful when leveraging off
third-party SWFs, because they may use features which are not
available in AR's FP.  

Leaving all that aside, I would however urge you to explore
the exciting document possibilities afforded by /RichMedia
annotations.

I had a quick look at the rmannot web-page, since I have been interested
in this aspect of latex/pdf presentation for some time. Unfortunately,
as far as I can tell, the real stumbling block to those of us in the
linux community is that the pdf creation needs to be done with Acrobat
Distiller, so there is no way for me to create such a pdf other than
find a Windows machine, pay for Distiller, gather together all my source
files, media, files, etc, and do my work in Windows.

See my previous mail, package `pdftexcmds' adds LuaTeX support
for most of the missing primitives in LuaTeX.

\usepackage{pdftexcmds}

% use \pdf at escapestring instead of \pdfescapestring.

However it does not solve the problem with TeX markup in the
string, see item (b) in my previous mail.

You have also to redefine \ctip at make@Widget.

It contains the line

  /URI (#2)

Thus you have to do the same as in \ctip at make@Text:

  \pdfstringdef\ctip at URI{#2}%
  ...
  /URI (\ctip at URI)

But the url action remains nonsense:
"more description("is not a valid URI.
A suggestion to drop the URI action I have already made,
see my mail with date "2010-10-09 01:43:44 +0200" to mailing
list texhax.

That's a good choice, if you
(a) are using pdfTeX
(b) the string is a plain (ascii) text string without TeX markup.

* Remarks for (a)

LuaTeX is supported via package `pdftexcmds' and \pdf at escapestring.
And package `pdfescape' adds support for other TeX engines.
However, the feature isn't expandable again.

\usepackage{pdfescape}

\EdefEscapeString\mystring{...}
% and using \mystring instead of "...".

* Remarks for (b)

> \cooltooltip{label}{description}{\pdfescapestring{more
> description(}}{}{content}

The description isn't the best candidate for \pdfescapestring,
because it's user input that might contain TeX markup,
also active characters can contain TeX markup (see package
inputenc). In this case I consider \pdfstringdef the best
choice, especially if hyperref is already loaded.

Because of \protected at write the whatsit will contain the token
\thepage instead of the expansion of \thePage. The whatis
is written and \thepage is then expanded at shipout time
long after the group of \Index is closed.

No. That's just the way the author of rmannot chose to develop his
package. If all you want to do is embed a SWF then following
is sufficient:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\mbox{}
\def\R{\space 0 R}\def\use{\immediate\pdfobj useobjnum}%
\def\my #1 {\pdfobj 
reserveobjnum\expandafter\edef\csname#1\endcsname{\the\pdflastobj}}%
\my RMend
\my RMcontent \my RMsettings \my RMconfiguration \my RMinstances \my 
RMinstance
\my RMasset   \my RMparams   \my RMbinding       \my RMassets    \my

\my RMwindow
\pdfannot width 340pt height 0pt depth 200pt{%

\use\RMassets    {<</Names[()\RMasset\R]>>}%
\use\RMconfigurations  {[\RMconfiguration\R]}%
\use\RMwindow    {<<>>} %
\end{document}

which plays ``The Colors of Infinty.'' 

But if you would like to continue the discussion offline,
I can show you what can be done under Linux with a bit
of lateral thinking.

It will be interesting to see when Linux will get AR X and which of
these problems that will fix. And how long it will take Okular et.al.
to get close to AR.

The security restrictions will not disappear with AR X, and as I'm on the 
beta release programme, I have been able to squash some bugs before it's 
unleashed on an unsuspecting public. As regards to Okular catching up with 
AR, I'm not too hopeful for two reasons: (i) AR is a moving target; (ii) 
AR's interactive features are very hard to pin down and I have a number of 
edge and corner cases which show that the PDF specification is incomplete. 
Thus I'm afraid developers will be in for a torrid time dealing with 
quirksmodes. But as I've been operating in Quirk mode all my life :-)
it will be business as usual.

Cheers,

James

Hi Karl, hi Ron,

you might use Y&Y TeX for debugging, cf. this error message:

    ! Undefined control sequence.
    <argument> \headerps at out 
     {/burl at stx null def /BU.S { /burl at stx null def } de...

    C:/YANDY/TEXINPUT/breakurl.sty(303) : }

i.e., the error occurs at line 303 of breakurl.sty, error messages show filenames (with path) together with the line number ... so nice ...

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

	format
Message-ID: <083D1037-28C8-430E-9467-BDA0CDA5427B@frycomm.com>

What is the proper way to go about doing this?

I need to create a new format which:

 - uses xetex (including all the nifty unicode stuff)
 - includes all of LaTeX
 - includes xmltex.tex
 - generates a .pdf file

So that I can type (say) xexmltex <filename.xml> (w/ appropriate .cfg, dtd, xmt &c. files in place) and get a typeset .pdf w/o having to create a .tex file and process all of xmltex.tex each time.

Please let me know what I should do, or which bit of documentation I missed.

Thanks.

William

To whom it may concern,

I have declared \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[chapter] in a book class document.
I have a theorem currently numbered, say, 3.2 (the second theorem in Chapter 3), and I would like to print a new version of the theorem later (in the same chapter), numbering it 3.2'.  How can I go about this?

Thanks for your attention.

I find this very interesting and this would certainly be a good option
for me. However, I could not get AR to play sound in your example
above. If I load the url in Firefox it plays it with sound. Any ideas
why? (I'm on Fedora 13 and AR 9.3.4 and Flash 10.1.85.3).

Subject: [texhax] Beamer Error
Message-ID: <4CC0A0D8.20802@ysu.edu>

I am running  MikTeX2.8 under Windows7 using WinEdt 6.0 as my editor. In 
the past I had no problem running
Beamer files but now every time I try to run files that have worked in 
the past (including the first sample Euler one in the
Beamer Guide) It gives me

("C:\Program Files (x86)\MiKTeX 2.8\tex\latex\psnfss\t1phv.fd")
*geometry* driver: auto-detecting
*geomery* detected driver: dvips
! Undefined control sequence.
\Gm at lmargin ->\Geom at lmargin

L.34 \begin{document}

?


The 34 refers, of course to the line on which the \begin{document 
resides. If I try to push through it
it gives a lot of other Undefined control sequence statements.

I cannot find a command \Gm at lmargin  anywhere in the loaded documents 
nor the other Undefined control sequences
it gives.

Any assistance would be appreciated. I reinstalled the Beamer package today

There is an easy way to include EPS files in WinEdt 6.0, and the later 
versions of 5.

Go to Options then Execution Modes.

Choose PDFTeX or PDFTeXify and go to TeX Options.

You will see a heading for the  Method you wish to employ.

  If you want to include EPS files choose the last one on the list

dvi -> ps -> pdf

Hit OK and you are done .

Best,
Doug

I have no problem runing this

\listfiles
\documentclass{beamer}
\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
   test

could you please try it and post the list of file versions it provides

there has been problems like this before, but that was many months ago

Works for me in AR 9.3.4 under Win/XP;SP3
Does not work for me in AA 7.1.0 (same environment).

Henrik,

First off you are *not* using Flash 10.1.85.3 with AR 9.3.4 .
AR comes bundled with its own FlashPlayer which for AR 9.3.4 is
9,0,280,0 which you can verify by changing directory to:

   Acrobat9.3.4/Adobe/Reader9/Reader/intellinux/lib

and running:

   strings libauthplay.so | grep LNX

Regarding the business with the sound, I used to have it the
other way around i.e. when playing a video in AR the sound
would not work in Firefox. This had to do with the way
my audio device was set up. So what I suggest you do is
try exiting Firefox and see if AR can then play sound when it
is the only sound oriented application. A reboot may be in order
to clear any file locks. 

But as I indicated in my posting, the /RichMedia capablity has not yet 
bedded down and so you may be out of luck. For example, on my machine, 
OpenSUSE 10.3, I find the loading of video is intermittent. Some days the 
connection is fine and on others the video refuses to connect. I have a 
secondary machine running OpenSUSE 11 and that has the same problem. While 
my wife's Linux machine, Ubuntu 9.1, flatly refuses to show anything at 
all. On the other hand my OSX 10.5.7 laptop never has any 
problems displaying the YouTube videos, which leads me to believe the 
problems  I'm having are all Linux-specific, rather than being a 
fuction of my internet provider.

I wouldn't expect it to work for AA7.x as it predates the
arrival of /RichMedia annotations.

Thanks for the quick reply. I have attached the file together with the 
output that was produced before I
discontinued execution. I hope this is satisfactory.

Thanks very much,

Thank you.That seems to have, at least initially, solved the problem.

For others who might fall into the same trap, be aware that the version 
of Beamer at Sourceforge

http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex-beamer/

is 3.07. I reinstalled this version before I sent my original query. I 
neglected to read the fine print which reads:

The Beamer class is a LaTeX class for creating presentations using a 
video projector. THIS PAGE IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED.
Home page:http://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer

The version at Bitbucket is 3.10. The version 3.07 gave the errors, the 
version 3.10 did not.

Sorry for my negligence.

Doug

More generally, \@ifstar expects two arguments, e.g., with braces. 

"Public" macros for making starred commands are provided by David Kastrup's suffix package:

besides the constructions already mentioned I'd like to mention xparse as well

I needed a macro that can do this

\name*{arg}[opt]*{arg}[opt]

(or simething similar)

with xparse that is a piece of cake, for example creating a macro with

\name{arg}[opt]{arg}[opt]

one can do

\DeclareDocumentCommand\name{momo}{...}

Subject: [texhax] TeX as a composition server? [originally on the pdftex
	list]
Message-ID: <4CC2B2B2.90903@free.fr>

  Hello Peter,

I've redirected your message to texhax at tug.org, a mailing list for TeX 
that is widely frequented (the pdfTeX mailing list is not really 
active). You'll find the list archives here:
http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax

As for the questions:

1) Thousands of pages per minutes is doable, but the speed really 
depends on what you do with pdfTeX. Simply text can go really fast. 
Complex operations can take much more time.
2) pdfTeX implements the HZ-program and can do that both in dvi and pdf.
3) No. There exists complex procedures to use Open- or TrueType fonts, 
but you don't want to go into that (me neither). In pdfTeX, it's either 
tfm (TeX native font format) or PostScript T1. But: there exist XeTeX 
and LuaTeX. Both allow you to use any kind of font. XeTeX don't produce 
dvi, though -- but anyway you can't use any font with dvi.

No need to apologize, by the way.

My two cents is: if you want a top-notch typographic system, use ConTeXt 
MkIV; ConTeXt is TeX, but with many things on top of it. You generally 
don't use TeX as is: instead, you use a set of macros, often called a 
format, which perhaps you've written by yourself (in which case you're 
free /and /lonely). ConTeXt is a format, and it's probably the most 
powerful of all, at least when it comes to typography. Speed is not its 
forte, though. LaTeX is another format, it's a little bit faster, but if 
you're looking for ``InDesign composition, with suitable parameters'', I 
wouldn't recommend it. Finally, you can write your own set of macros, 
but that's definitely not the better way to start!

Best,
Paul

Oh, sorry, I thought you'd never used TeX.

As far as I know (I'm not a ConTeXt user), processing of XML is 
implemented in ConTeXt. Thousands of pages per minute, I'm not so sure, 
though...
No need for font conversion; ConTeXt is now based on LuaTeX, which is 
basically pdfTeX plus tons of enhancements, including modern font formats.
Now, for the thing about the server, I'm totally incompetent... Do you 
mean something that can be called from a distant computer?

ConTeXt is run via intermediate files (i.e. you don't call the engine 
directly), and perhaps you can use parameters here. I'm a bit lost about 
the box, though? What box? Anyway, if you use modern font formats, 
that'll be pdf, not dvi. Sorry I can't help more!

Hi, Paul,

Thank you!  I've joined the texhax list.  (Is that pronounced "hack" or 
"hacks"?)

Thanks for your replies.  I have some follow-up questions, specifically 
about TeX formats (LaTeX, ConTeXt, XeTeX, etc.)  I've actually been a 
LaTeX user for years, and written a few of my own macros, mostly cobbled 
together from examples I found elsewhere.

The problem I'm now facing is trying to create a server that can produce 
results "similar to"[1] InDesign, but much faster.  This would be for 
documents already created in InDesign and exported to an XML format, so 
the task would be to convert the XML to whatever-TeX (possibly via 
XSLT), and then compose the results at a rate of thousands of pages per 
minute.  The server would have to support TrueType/OpenType and Type 1 
fonts, though I could put off worrying about CID-keyed fonts for a 
while.  It *may* be possible to convert any required fonts to T1 format, 
and even extract TFM on the fly.

Ideally, I'd like to be able to invoke this server with some style 
parameters, box dimensions, and a stream of marked-up text.  The stream 
could contain TeX mark-up for changing fonts, color, style, etc.  We'd 
like to have something like longtables also.  The server would return 
the formatted composed box (in .dvi format?) and a pointer to how much 
of the input text stream was able to fit in the box, so that the server 
could be re-invoked with another box for overflow.

I don't mind the propsect of writing my own macros, but I don't want to 
duplicate features that are already available in some existing format or 
package.

Thanks very much!

-pd


[1] I don't have a rigorous definition of "similar to."  The goal is 
that an InDesign user should not be surprised by the results.

Subject: [texhax] Help formatting table of contents
Message-ID: <20101024185634.GB8849@srevilak.net>

I'm using LaTeX to write my dissertation, and I need to ask for
assistance in changing the table of contents format.

My university department has an "unofficial" documentclass that's more
or less a family heirloom.  It's passed down from generation to
generation of graduate students and each hier touches it up as
necessary to conform to university formatting requirements.
Ultimately, the documentclass was based on report.cls; and I think
that a solution that works with the standard report class will also
work for me.

Attached is a sample document for illustration.  The sample document
has a table of contents where the page numbers are right-aligned
against the right margin of the page.  I need the page numbers to be
right-aligned 5.5 inches from the left margin of the page.

I'm sure that my TOC will be longer than one page, so putting
\tableofcontents inside a minipage isn't an option.  I've tried
changing \textwidth before and after \tableofcontents, but that does
not seem to have any effect.

Any suggestions on how to change the position of the page numbers?

Many thanks in advance.

Subject: [texhax] Local search path
Message-ID: <477885.39778.qm@web29505.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I have a big project with many files. 
I would like to create subdirectories by file types:
- style files
- pictures
- chapters
- ...
and only keep the master files in the main directory.

Is there a way to tell pdflatex to search for files in these directories WITHOUT 
making explicit reference to the complete path in the \input, \include and 
\usepackage command?

I known that for picture files it is possible with the command
\graphicspath
from the package graphicx

What for .sty files and .tex files, and any other files?

May be I could play with a texmf.cnf file to add some subdirectories: 
"pictures", "styles", "inputs" etc... in the TEXINPUTS variable.
But I don't know if I can create a local version of such a file (in the main 
directory, in my texmf tree?) and what is the correct syntax to use.

So I ask for advises and comments
Thanks in advance
Thierry

This is the obvious way to do it, but I guess it depends on your
operating system as to how you go about setting your personal TEXINPUTS
variable. You should read the FAQ at
 http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=tempinst

In my linux system, for example, my .cshrc file sets up my shell
environment variables something like:

setenv TEXINPUTS .:/usr/share/latex2html/texinputs:/home/sjs/mylatex//:
setenv BSTINPUTS .:{$TEXINPUTS}:
setenv BIBINPUTS .:{$TEXINPUTS}:

The trailing // will descend recursively into sub-directories of
mylatex, so I put all my things there (you could have subdirectories of
styles, inputs, etc.; or you could add specific directories to
TEXINPUTS. The leading "." ensures tex searches the current working
directory, although that is probably unnecessary. I'm not 100% sure that
the graphicx package uses these paths, but you already know how to
specify the graphicspath.

On the LaTeX level (instead of the system level), Donald Arseneau's 'import' package,

    http://ctan.org/pkg/import

seems to provide at least partial solutions. I expect that achieving the feature with \usepackage is difficult ...

This would be for documents already created in InDesign and exported to an XML format, so the task would be to convert the XML to whatever-TeX (possibly via XSLT), and then compose the results at a rate of thousands of pages per minute.  The server would have to support TrueType/OpenType and Type 1 fonts, though I could put off worrying about CID-keyed fonts for a while.  It *may* be possible to convert any required fonts to T1 format, and even extract TFM on the fly.

The server would return the formatted composed box (in .dvi format?) and a pointer to how much of the input text stream was able to fit in the box, so that the server could be re-invoked with another box for overflow.

The closest thing to this (I happen to be working on the same thing at the moment here at work) which I've found is:

 - xelatex (or lualatex) (chose latex for familiarity's sake and availability of packages)
 - xmltex
 - custom .xmt files which apply all the formatting

The problem I've hit is that I've not yet been able to create an xexmltex format file yet.

Vafa,

Unfortunately, this does not look good.  bahar.tex seems to be nothing
more than a long series of null bytes:

    $ tr -d '\000' < bahar.tex | wc -c
    0

There doesn't appear to be anything in the file to recover.

Hopefully your user has a backup copy.  If not, depending on your
users' operating system, you might try some form of disk recovery
software.

Sorry for the bad news :(

I have tried this package and it corresponds for a part to what I wanted.
I am waiting for a more complete solution (? la "\graphicspath"), but this
one can do the job for the moment.

Thanks a lot for this solution.

Following worked for me:

\makeatletter

\def\filepath{{/tmp/}{/Users/cvr/}{/opt/NLM/jnl-xml/}}
\let\input at path=\filepath

\InputIfFileExists{path-tmp.tex}{Available}{NOT Available}
\InputIfFileExists{path-home.tex}{Available}{NOT Available}
\InputIfFileExists{path-jnl-xml.tex}{Available}{NOT Available}

I think, you might change the definition of \filepath as per your requirements.

This looks interesting.
Does this change the search paths for any file?

Here is the last point I would like to solve:
I have modified a sty file (from beamer) that is included somewhere is the
process of loading the beamer stuff.
For the moment, this sty file is in the main directory, so that it is called
correctly.
I would like to put it in a specific subfolder (with other personnal sty
files I have managed to put there, thanks to the import package).
But in this subfolder it will not be loaded because tex will not try to find
it there...
I could have put it in my texmf folder, but then it would interfere with
other projects, which I don't want.
So, a good solution would to be tell tex, as a per project solution, to add
a specific subfolder in the TEXINPUTS variable.

In your code, I see a "\input at path" macro. I don't know what it does... I
will search the Internet. Maybe your code can be used to solve my "problem".

Thanks a lot
Thierry

Now the question is: what editor?  Text editors usually maintain a 
previous version as a backup copy, and sometimes a check of recent
edits so the content can be restored to within a few minutes.

Look for files (perhaps hidden files) with "bahar" in the name.

I'm wondering what filled up the file with null bytes.  This can't
happen when power is cut.  It just takes too much time to write such a
file.  It's more likely that the file system is corrupt and the system
tried to repair it at boot time.  On Linux I would then look for
orphaned data blocks in the lost+found directory of the partition
containing the file.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I'm investigating using TeX as a composition engine for an existing
publishing workflow.  The goal would be to make TeX callable, so I would
pass in some text and some parameters, and get back dvi.

I know Jonathan Fine did some work a while ago on a TeX daemon.  Has anyone
heard anything further about this?  Any other efforts to make TeX a callable
library or something?

Thank you,

Thanks, Michael,

I was thinking more of a real C/C++ call interface, where I could call a
function to compose some text, maybe after creating an instance of a TeX
engine, setting it's parameters, etc.

Making the two double back slashes into single backslashes:

does the trick, creating three files:

article.aux article.dvi article.log

then:

dvips article.dvi

gives a nice article.ps.  I put these together into a file, made it
executable (chmod) and now have a small self contained typesetting
engine.

It's worth actually trying code.  Apparently the backslash is not
protecting the second backslash - both are passed by the shell to
latex.

Message-ID: <4CC8650A.7000004@gmail.com>

How can I change the font used for the ampersand, in a way that depends
on the surrounding font?  Specifically, I want to type
	big \& small; \textit{tall \& wide}
and have the effect of
	big \textsc{\&} small; \textit{tall \& wide}
instead.

(I?m using the font Fontin, where I like the italic font?s ?&?, but I
think the upright font?s version is too big for the short snippets of
text in my r?sum?.)

Is there a good way to do this?

... reminds me of 
 
    texd runs TeX as a daemon, and provides a callable function interface.
    This allows TeX to be used as the typesetting engine for interactive applications.

If you google for "tex daemon" you get a few links to Jonathan's
stuff.

I don't know whether the following link is helpful at all and whether
the project is still alive:

You can create a new counter for "inside theorem" equations, 
reset by the "theorem" counter -- you seem to use a  "theorem" 
counter shared by all "theorem-like" environments -- for argument's 
sake I assume you indeed call it "theorem", by default or your set-up 
\thetheorem expands to `\thesection.\arabic{theorem}'. Then, e.g.:

    \newcounter{eqinthm}[theorem]
    \renewcommand{\theeqinthm}{\thetheorem.\arabic{eqinthm}}

so you can use \tag{\theeqinthm}.

With \tag, you seem to use amsmath, so you can even use the 
standard "equation" counter for \tag:

    \numberwithin{equqation}[theorem]
    \renewcommand{\theequation}{\thetheorem.\arabic{equation}}

So when you add a theorem-like environment like your corollary, 
the \tag content is adjusted automatically, of course don't use 
\tag with manual content! 

Oh, may be, "inside theorem equations" are rare in your work. 
Then simply use

    ... \tag{\thetheorem.1}
    ... \tag{\thetheorem.2}

so, although the numbering is manual partially, there is an automatic 
component caring for insertions of other theorem-like environments. 

HTH -- Uwe.

No doubling of backslashes.  (Double all backslashes if the

in the previous century I programmed on BigIron==z/OS==MVS
and batch processing using ISPF was the only way to go.

I worked in the provided editor of my statistical software SAS
for several years until my companion/partner/girlfriend
whispered in my year: batch.
and have pretty much not looked back to an interactive session
in SAS
since then

With that knowledge I have written a SAS wiki page:

Batch Processing under Windows 

TinyUrl: http://tinyurl.com/6zlqoh 

http://www.sascommunity.org/wiki/Batch_processing_under_Windows

the issues are pretty much the same for TeX users
under Windows:

- - - 00-LaTeX-this.bat - - -
pdfLaTeX my-TeX-doc

the wiki page discusses how to modify SAS configuration and autoexec
files
I am not enough of a TeXnician to even want to consider creating or
modifying
a TeX configuration file
but it is simple in SAS.
and may be part of the requestor's solution

My wishlist for TeXlive is
* autoexec.tex
* command line parameters and parsing

Here is an example using my knowledge and syntax of SAS:

- - - 00-LaTeX-this-with-parms.bat - - -
pdfLaTeX my-boilerplate-doc -sysparm='\input{i-customer-Fehd}'

and another way of doing the boilerplate with parms is:

%name: boilerplate-Fehd.tex
\input{i-customer-Fehd}
\input{boilerplate-about-this-issue}

%name: i-customer-Fehd.tex
\newcommand\CustName{R J Fehd}
\newcommand\CustAddr{Atl GA USA}

for non-native speakers here is a defintion of boilerplate:

Message-ID: <56BAF69624B918479F049F7070C6F7DC9626BFA1A9@ALTPHYEMBEVSP10.RES.AD.JPL>

Hi,

we have the following issue with pdflatex (pdfetex).

We have the standard rpm package of tetex-3.0-33.8.el5_5.5 installed on our Red Hat EL5_64 systems. Here are the details:

(exporting $TTG  variable)

bash$ export TTG=/home/user

(then we run)

bash$ pdflatex file.tex

(here is what we get)

... some output

pdftex: define anchor at line 34: Doc-Start

! LaTeX Error: File `$TTG/doc/io.tex' not found.

Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed,
or enter new name. (Default extension: tex)

The file /home/user/doc/io.tex does exist.

In the file.tex we have a section which is calling the io.tex file. Here it is:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% LATEX CODE

\begin{document}

% Note: pdflatex expands environment variables automatically, but doxygen does
% not.
\input{$TTG/doc/io.tex}


\end{document}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In other words pdfetex does not interpret $TTG env. variable which was exported previously.

Do you know what can we do in this case other than hard coding the absolute path of the io.tex file in the file.tex ?


We have some Red Hat WS4_64 systems which have tetex-2.0.2-22.0.1.EL4.16 rpm package installed. The same problem does not happen on those systems. Pdflatex interprets the $TTG variable and the file runs through giving the output.

Thank You!

Well, this is actually shell dependent (it shouldn't be, I suppose,
but it is). But really guys, all I wanted to indicate is that its
easy to pipe stuff into latex. This does not seem to be widely known.

Even less widely known, you can easily read input off the command line.
For example, if the contents of test.tex is

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\read16 to\myinputline
Here is the input: \myinputline
\end{document}

then the line
echo '\TeX{} is great!' | latex test.tex
will insert the echoed material into the printed page.

Cheers,
Michael

I am not aware of anything close to that.  LuaTeX has been unbundling
the typesetter, but there is no standalone C library at this point, as
far as I know.

  http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2007-January/006999.html
  
That little project by Thanh does exist (http://runptex.sarovar.org),
but it is about encapsulating runs of pdfTeX (as a whole) in a library,
rather than the kind of piecemeal functionality Peter is describing.

Best,
karl

To recycle JFK's Moon Speech, ``the greater my software knowledge,
the greater my ignorance unfolds.'' But if you're up for a 
challenge, take a look at:

http://www.amrita-cfd.org/tex-group/equation-editor.pdf

and you will see an example of TeX as a callable engine that works at 
two-levels: (i) a program invoked TeX to produce the PDF; (ii) the PDF 
invokes either Mathtran remotely or a localhost server embedded in the PDF 
so as to be able to typeset TeX equations input interactively. Note that 
Mathtran is Jonathan Fine's work mentioned earlier in this thread, which 
delivers PNGs. The localhost server employs SWFs with scalable fonts for 
improved legibility.

Also be sure to view the PDF with AR9.3.4 on Linux, as AR9.4.0 is broken.

The document includes its own source-code browser to show you how it was 
programmed. You can activate it from the bookmarks panel.(And Victor, I've 
checked that this example runs under OSX, provided you have swftools 
installed, see http://www.swftools.org/download.html). No AMRITA needed.

Now what am I selling? Certainly not myself or a software package. A good 
place to start would be this newspaper article that appeared in the UK, 
back in February:

``If you're going to do good science, release the compuer code too''
http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/feb/05/science-climate-emails-code-release

My comment snuck in at the end and so has its own url:

http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/feb/05/science-climate-emails-code-release?showallcomments=true#end-of-comments

After talking to the article's author, I started on a piece of work that 
has yielded three acknowledged AR vulnerabilities and counting.

Where am I going with this ramble. Well it's very clear that the 
programming capabilties on this newsgroup are every bit as variable as 
they are in the rest of society. And therein lies the reason I would, 
today, hesitate to claim that '\TeX{} is great!' without critically 
appraising where the system is weak.

Before I'm flamed, you have to understand that I have my eye on the year 
2360. Yes none of us will be around, but the thought experiment to 
consider is how will our document actions be judged by our descendants. 
Sad to say, in the computational sciences I am not at all confident we 
will be thought of highly, for the reasons given in the URL above.

My concern, and primary reason for popping up here, is that there are 
many, many software tricks which are not widely appreciated. And once you 
start going down a path that ponders ways to improve the communication of 
computing, in its broadest sense, all sorts of weaknesses of TeX start to 
surface. Note that does not detract from TeX's design strengths, I'm 
talking strictly about its current implementation. Also note that my work 
in this area is aimed at understanding certain software issues, and is not 
aimed at usurping TeX or any other software package. For instance,
the equation-editor example seamlessly leverages off LaTeX, Perl, Ruby,
ActionScript, JavaScript, and MXML. And the same basic approach can
be used with R, or Octave, or pretty much any package that can
be batch driven.

My final thought is the following. Courtesy of Goole I am just a couple of 
clicks away from investigating any person on this newsgroup. Thus I came 
across Ron Fehd's ``Everything you ever wanted to know about a program but 
were afraid to ask'' in which he concludes: ``Program documentation is an 
over-looked and under-appreciated aspect of programming effort. Effective 
documentaiton contributes to program reuse. The costs associated with 
documentation are miniscule in comparison to those associated with 
redevelopment.'' But with recent developments in electronic formats the 
distinction between a program and a document is much smaller than it used 
to be, and in the years to come it will get even smaller. Therefore what 
long-term evolution path do you, and the other contributors on this 
thread, see as being needed so as to keep TeX's intellectual spirit alive?

Cheers,

James

My problem is well illustrated by the following file

\documentstyle{article}
\def\bbrack#1{[\![#1]\!]}
\begin{document}
$\bbrack{\widehat c =\widehat d}$
\end{document}

Yes, I could add extra space after the argument, but that is a real 
kludge.  My real question is why can't I get the \widehat to actually be 
centered over its argument.  As you can see, it starts halfway along the 
"d" and ends well to the right.  This is also true of the one on the "c" 
so it is not just centering over an ascender.

Is it not centered w.r.t. the italic slope ?

Indeed. Try removing the \bbrack. And to see it better compare:

\widehat{H} and \widehat{\/H} or even worse

\widehat{I} and \widehat{\/I}

So really I think the original question is mis-titled. It should be
"Badly placed right-bracket" which I would be inclined to agree with.

I don't really care what it is centered with respect to.  It looks awful 
and I don't expect tex to produce awful-looking output.  In all cases it 
ought to be centered over the glyph, not some extension of the slope.

Michael, I fear that you are wrong.  $\widehat{c}=\widehat{d}$ *is*
correct and *looks* correct.  Please try $\widehat{X}=\widehat{Y}$ too
and you'll see that it *has* to be done this way.

However, what IMO is incorrect is the output of $[c = d]$.  On the
other hand, $[\mathrm{c}=\mathrm{d}]$ looks ok.

  \documentclass{article}
  \parskip=2ex
  \begin{document}
  $\widehat c =\widehat d$ \par 
  $\widehat X =\widehat Y$ \par
  $[c = d]$ \par 
  $[\mathrm{c}=\mathrm{d}]$
  \end{document}

Regards,
  Reinhard

I think it's a combination of the limitations of TeX's math typesetting algorithms (using \skewchar and italic correction for accent placement etc.) and font design choices. For example, I find the result with Cambria Math (compiled with LuaTeX) quite a bit nicer:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\setmathfont{Cambria Math}
\begin{document}
$(\hat d)$
\end{document}

Maybe you just have to switch to a different math font.

If you are convinced of that, Michael, I suggest you report it
as a bug to Don.  Please let us know when you receive a hexadecimal

Ooooh! Petulent fanboi.

> $(\widehat d)$

There are many issues here, and who knows what bugs you
the most.

1) the letter "d" has its high point over on the right, but the 
accent is centered over the entire letter, extrapolated along the
slope.  If you take the wide part of the d, follow a sloped line
up parallel to the stem, you nearly meet the apex of the hat.
I bet you expect the hat to be aligned with the stem only.

2) The character d in computer modern math italic has the wrong
bounding box. This is a typical Knutian ad-hoc-hack so that 
"dx" looks like a differential instead of d times x.  Compare
$d\vrule = \l\vrule$.

3) Math accents are made invisible to the rest of the layout.
(viz ${\hat x}^2$).  The overlap on the side is the inevitable
result when you put a wider accent on a narrower letter

It's not pdftex which expands env vars.  Works with Knuth's TeX too.

$ echo hello > ~/foo.tex

$ tex '\input $HOME/foo.tex \bye'
This is TeX, Version 3.1415926 (TeX Live 2010)
(/home/reinhard/foo.tex) [1]
Output written on foo.dvi (1 page, 212 bytes).
Transcript written on foo.log.

I suppose that kpathsea expands env vars.  Please note that I even
didn't have to change \catcode`\$ .

I keep getting this annoying error when trying to compile my TeX files.  It
results in me getting an extra page (that is not supposed to be there)

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.

Subject: [texhax] Problem with Appendices
Message-ID: <20101029185801.0E44517E59A@smtp.nfit.au.dk>

Dear support

I hope this is how you do things in support.

\

I am using Latex running under Miktex 2.8 with class: amsbook.

Lenny fncychap, fancyhdr, and it all works perfectly, except.

\

In the CONTENTS list of a .dvi output (i.e. at the start of the finished
pages), the word chapter appears correctly as in Chapter 1, Chapter 2,
etc. up to 17 in my case.

But when it gets to the Appendices, it goes Chapter A, Chapter B, rather
that Appendix A, Appendix B.

\

So the numbers change to letters as they should, but the word chapter
stays as chapter.

\

The titles on the page headers in the appendices Left and Right are OK.

\

I understand that \appendix should be called ONCE only, then one should
revert to \chapter - even in appendices.

\

Hope you can help.

Regards
Keith

Very interesting, and "Philipp Stephani" , 29.10.2010 22:38:54
suggests using a different font for math italic:

Two issues from the former:

(A) Michael Barr  writes:
> I don't expect tex to produce awful-looking output.
But the TeXbook says on p. 167: 

    Chapter 16 says that TeX does automatic spacing 
    of math formulas so that they look right, and this is 
    almost true. But occasionally you must give TeX 
    some help.

(ctan.org/pkg/nath tries to be somewhat smarter.)
I am continuing this issue below for the special case of brackets. 

(B) *Which font could I switch to with Computer Modern to get proper spacing in math??*
(We had this issue much earlier, raised by Michael Barr too.) 
The secret motivation for my question is that actually 
somebody hopes I will create a \mathnormal font 
from Adobe Caslon. This would be my first virtual font or so ...
... just in case somebody can save me from some 
of my own investigations, I do know where to look myself ...

"Donald Arseneau" [ continued:

In Michael Barr's expample, the \widehat in $[\widehat d]$ 
somewhat looks like $[\widehat{d]}$, the right bracket is 
beneath the accent, cf. "Reinhard Kotucha" 
<reinhard.kotucha at web.de>, 29.10.2010 22:55:33:

Brackets/parantheses try to "embrace" their scope really 
tightly, apparently even from top and below. Three aspects:

(C) (Somewhat trivial:) cmex has only *three widths* for \widehat, 
so there is no adjustment to the actual shape of a single character 
in its scope, and it may look "too wide" in certain situations ...

(D) Ends of parentheses/brackets seem to touch 
the bounding box of the scope or even intrude into it 
(this is my impression especially with square brackets). 
This may look fine in something like

    has [a] hat

but I don't like 

   has [a wide] hat

I then tend to prefer 

   has [ a wide ] hat

I think it is for a similar reason that the TeXbook, pp. 174ff., recommends typing 

     $\{\,CONTENT\,\}$

rather than 

    $\{CONTENT\}$

for certain purposes. So one suggestion I have for Michael Barr is 

    $[\,\widehat d\,]$

But there is something else ...

(E) Brackets are designed to be at least as high and deep as the 
bounding box of what they "embrace". This works with simple words, 
but accents ... in math one may think of the automatic scaling 
of delimiters using \left and \right ... I try ... even the `exscale' package ... 
sorry, in this case ... somebody might provide a package that 
*raises* brackets then the scope has no descenders but accents ... 

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

A bug in ltxcmds. It's already fixed, but the bundle is not
yet released. For manual install (see section Installation):
  http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~oberdiek/tmp/ltxcmds.pdf
Or update hyperref.

Ok, I keep recommending my earlier $[\,CONTENT\,]$ for certain 
CONTENTs, but I see it is a halfway solution if any.

So simply do so: 

    \newcommand*\Widehat[1]{\widehat{\hbox{$#1$}}}
    \def\bbrack#1{[\![#1]\!]}
    $\bbrack{\Widehat c =\Widehat d}$

or as recommended earlier:

    $\bbrack{\,\Widehat c =\Widehat d\,}$

and if the argument of \bbrack will always have spaces from 
relation symbols and the like, I would indeed recommend

    \newcommand*\Widehat[1]{\widehat{\hbox{$#1$}}}
    \def\bbrack#1{[\![\,#1\,]\!]}
    $\bbrack{\Widehat c =\Widehat d}$

-- tested!

I confess that, when I read this, I was shaken to the core.
I know that one must expect one's idols to have feet of clay,
but to learn that Don had fudged mathit "d" so that differentials
would look better was not something that I had expected.

Worse, I then did my own tests, and compared the following :

	\hbox to 3 em {\hfill $df$}
	\hbox to 3 em {\hfill $lf$}
	\end

and the differences there are nothing short of staggering.

This is, in part, explained by Donald's analysis of the
bounding box, but one also finds in "mathit.mf" :

	ligtable "d": "Y" kern u#, "Z" kern-u#, "j" kern-2u#, "f" kern-3u#, % $d:$

I now feel rather depressed.

Interesting. This is something that I didn't know until now, too. Again, this doesn't happen with Cambria Math, and I think it would be better to have a dedicated \differential command than to modify bounding boxes for this single purpose.

Nice idea, interesting results: \left/\right seem to ignore accents and limits altogether with `nath':

    ...
    \usepackage{nath}
    \begin{document}
      $$\left[\widehat d\right]\quad 
          \left[\hbox{${\widehat d}$}\right]\quad 
          \left[\hbox{\vrule height 3ex ${\widehat d}$}\right]\quad 
          \left[\sum_{i=0}^\infty x_i]$$
    \end{document}

nath does implement lots of good ideas, too bad it is so isolated and development has ceased. Maybe some of the ideas could make their way into ConTeXt/LuaLaTeX?

I had a brain cramp when I typed \documentstyle instead of
\documentclass.  Sorry about that.  But it was exactly the same when I
corrected that.  But the person who suggested that my \eql macro was
badly defined angered me.  So I got the same behavior with the
right paren.  Is that also misdefined?  Petulant? Maybe, but the
suggestion was unhelpful.

No, I was expecting the apex to be centered on the glyph.  Silly me.
But convince me that it should be centered over the extension of the
slant.  I tried following the "d" with "\/", but it made no difference.

The first convincing explanation I have seen.  I wrote a book, published
maybe ten years ago, which d^1, d^n, ..., appeared repeatedly (since you
didn't ask, they were face operators) and eventually had to define my
own macro "\dee" that did what "d" should have.  Although off-topic,
Knuth's decision to make the height of the "-" the same as that of the
"+" is also extremely annoying (a dotted minus sign requires you to
guess what the actual height is, put it in a box, put the dot on top of
that.

I grant you that.  The reason is that the ordinary \hat fades into near
insignifigance.  What I want is something just a bit wider.

Beautiful!  It does work.

But the "d" is still too close to the right bracket, but thanks to Donald 
Arsenau I now understand why.  But that is a problem with the character 
"d", not with \mathaccent.

I was quoting from memory, and I think the absence of italic 
correction (kern with skew character) is the major contributor.
There *is* a difference in bounding box (d has no white-space
side bearing whereas l has a fair bit).  But I was being sloppy
and jumbling it all together.

Also, Don's reasoning is mere surmise.  Having the same first name
confers no telepathic connection.

Tlmgr shows the svn revision of the package, so checking the svn logs
