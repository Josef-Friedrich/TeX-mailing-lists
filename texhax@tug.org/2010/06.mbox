Subject: [texhax] Beamer formatting
Message-ID: <AANLkTil5qe34sjY_2UivT6_T0qZjndOpcvQOFXRxcm8T@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am having a formatting issue with beamer here and I can't really seem to
find the fix. I must confess that I am a little confused sometimes by the
finer details of beamer although as a whole I love it. The example below
produces the issue I am trying to remove. The small break at the bottom
right hand corner on the sidebar is distracting but I can't seem to figure
out how to simply extend the bar all the way to the bottom of the frame. I
would like keep the frame number.

Any ideas on how I might be able to fix this?

\documentclass{beamer}[14pt]
\usepackage{beamerthemesplit}


\usetheme{PaloAlto}
\setbeamertemplate{footline}[frame number]
\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}

\title{Test}
\begin{document}
\frame{\titlepage}
\end{document}

Subject: [texhax] endfloat package with sideways table/figure and
	input{table}
Message-ID: <165840.96578.qm@web25106.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am trying to send figures and tables?at the end of a latex document.?I have some problems:
- first my tables are imported with the command \input{} and,
- then figures and tables are sideways.

I have added the file endfloat.cfg where my .tex files are but
- only the .ttt file is created
- only one table get to the end (of 2) after the List of Tables; there is no [Table 2 about here]; the other table is moved before List of Tables.
- figures are moved to the end but there is no List of Fig and they are moved before the List of Tables; There is nowhere a [Fig 1 (or 2)?about here]
I saw your post on texhax.

I guess the problem comes from the fact that .endfloat does not read the \end{sidewaystable} or something?

Any idea someone??

Best,

?David Biau.

Dear Sir,
it would be quite helpful if you could provide a minimal example which
allow other people to reproduce your problem.

It's not sufficient to tell us that "there are some problems".? Maybe
even the error message you got gives us a hint.? But it's easier to
debug something if there is a tiny file which demonstrates the
problem.

And this approach will work with sectioning commands (section, chapter
etc).

<example>

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[T2A,T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inptenc}? ? ? ? ???%%% Only if you will insert Russian letters

}

\begin{document}

\section{This section shows how to use \Russian{??????? ?????}}

This is a \Russian{????}.
\end{document}

</example>

You need babel package only if you want some part of your book to be
typeset on Russian exclusively (russian words are hyphenated, sectioning
commands, table and figure environments have appropriate prefixes on
Russian).

Subject: [texhax] Book format with article-style headings
Message-ID: <AANLkTiltZXZqjzPBoM0Qu0JujfY8MVKV0TIyE9-j39tk@mail.gmail.com>

Dear good people of Texhax,

I am trying to typeset a 'documentclass{book}' document that will have
article-style headings. In other words, no 'chapter' option, just section,
subsection, and subsubsection.

But I am afraid matters aren't all that simple. What I am working on is a
critical edition of a text. For convenience I will call this text AA. Text
AA is preceded by a few chapters in which I explain what text AA is. I want
these opening chapters to appear in standard 'book' format, with the usual
book-style headings. But I want the second element in my work, namely text
AA, to appear in 'book' format with article-style headings. And I want to do
all this without using package 'fancyhdr'.

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thanks,

Roy

I think you need to put a beamercolorbox in the footline of width 
\beamer at sidebarwidth:

\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{beamerthemesplit}
\usetheme{PaloAlto}

\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}
\makeatletter
\newlength\footwidth
\setlength\footwidth\paperwidth
\advance\footwidth by -\beamer at sidebarwidth %
\defbeamertemplate*{footline}{PaloAlto}{%
   \leavevmode
 
\begin{beamercolorbox}[wd=\beamer at sidebarwidth,ht=2.5ex,dp=1.125ex,centered]{title 
in head/foot}%
   \end{beamercolorbox}%
   \begin{beamercolorbox}[wd=\footwidth,ht=2.5ex,dp=1.125ex]{footline}%
 
\usebeamerfont{footline}\hfill\llap{\insertframenumber/\inserttotalframenumber\hskip0.2cm}%
   \end{beamercolorbox}%
}%
\makeatother

might be a lot easier to do this with the memoir class which can be seen 
as a dropin replacement for book. It has a much better page style 
support, and the styles are very easy make. In your case something like

\copypagestyle{mystyle}{headings}

\addtopsmarks{mystyle}{
    \clearmark{chapter} % we do not want chapter data
    \createmark{section}{both}{shownumber}{}{. \ } % write to both
    \createmark{subsection}{both}{shownumber}{}{. \ }
    \createmark{subsubsection}{both}{shownumber}{}{. \ }
}

\setsecnumdepth{subsubsection}
\maxsecnumdepth{subsubsection}

then activate mystyle at the point where you need the change.

Subject: [texhax] Theorem numbering
Message-ID: <AANLkTikfTy-BrIyHTIv6N3O-PZ8VKqc4MFmnDYNgY-DI@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using the amsthm-Package and number my theorem within sections, i.e.

\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[section]

Now I would like to quote a theorem from the end of the paper in the
introduction with its original number (which is 9.1 in my case).
Of course I could do so by manually setting the counters:

\setcounter{section}{9}
\setcounter{thm}{0}
\begin{thm}
...
\end{thm}
\setcounter{section}{1}
\setcounter{thm}{0}

but this destroys the idea of automatic numbering, because if my
theorem becomes Theorem 9.2 because it is preceded by Lemma 9.1, it
has the wrong number in the introduction.
When I once had the problem of quoting a theorem *after* it had been
stated, I used the following makros the save and recover the counters:

\newcounter{position_counter}
\newcounter{go_on_counter}
\newcommand{\remember}[1]{\setcounter{position_counter}{\value{#1}}}
\newcommand{\recall}[1]{\setcounter{go_on_counter}{\value{#1}}\setcounter{#1}{\value{position_counter}}\addtocounter{#1}{-1}}
\newcommand{\goon}[1]{\setcounter{#1}{\value{go_on_counter}}}

\begin{thm}
...
\end{thm}
\remember{thm}

...

\recall{thm}
\begin{thm}
...
\end{thm}
\goon{thm}

But how can I can obtain the number before the actual statement (using
the \label)? I imagine there should exist solutions to this, but I did
not find them on the web (and I don't know enough about
makro-programming, to extract the necessary information from the
\label-data myself). Many thanks in advance!

Best regards,
Stefan

question : is it possible to write lines like \newlength{\PSSCALyunit} \setlength{\PSSCALyunit}{\psyunit} \psset{yunit=\PSSCALyunit} 
to save and restore the default value of dotsize and tbarsize ?

Thanks for your answer.

For people interested , Look at this newcommand :

I think that the problem, as Martin suggested, is that I am using texlive
2007 from the Ubuntu 9.10 repos. Unfortunately right now I don't have the
time to upgrade and deal with any potential issues from the upgrade so I
suppose I will just have to live with the small gap.

Thanks Martin for your help.

Sam

Message-ID: <12681275501068@web13.yandex.ru>



Hello,

I am quite new to latex environment. I am using TexShop on a Mac an recently had problems with inserting a figure:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=16cm,draft=true]{//Users/PhD/FIGURES THESIS/FIGURES THESIS CHAPTER 2//All data coverage SLP.pdf}
\caption{Data coverage (\%) ICOADS SLP for four time periods}
\label{fig:fig2.1}
\end{figure}

The figure is inserted, everything looks fine apart of the fact that on the top of the figure you can see the file name: //Users/PhD/LATEX THESIS/FIGURES THESIS/FIGURES THESIS CHAPTER 2//All data coverage SLP.pdf

I really need to get rid of it somehow, but I did not manage.

That's because you're using the "draft=true" option. Remove it, and the
actual figure (the pdf file) itself will be inserted instead of the file
name.

Hi,
By the way, if you want to increase the compilation speed (because you have
a lot of pictures), I suggest you to use the command
\psdraft (with \usepackage{epsfig} in preamble)
>From \psdraft, all the following pictures will bre replaced back empty
boxes.

\newcommand\scal[1]{{%
  \psset{unit=1cm}
  ...
}}

holds the setting local and there is no need to save and restore the
current unit. Alternatively use \psdot[yunit=...,xunit=...](0,0.75)
which is also a local setting.

a) With option "draft=true", the image is not inserted, instead the
   file name is shown in a box.
b) Spaces in file names are troublesome.
   If pdfTeX is used in PDF mode (e.g. pdflatex), then
   package grffile helps:
     \usepackage{grffile}
   Otherwise the image can't be found and the part after the
   first space character is printed additionally.

Yours sincerely

oops, \addtopsmarks takes 3 arguments

\addtopsmarks{mystyle}{}{

Hi,

I am quite new in using latex. I would like to make beamer background to be
transparent where I am using the background for the first slide.

Subject: [texhax] Graphics from R into Latex
Message-ID: <AANLkTilfDcv4frhVGww57P9aVYvRvU1lAo_3eLGIRqEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have produced produced a graph in R which I have saved as a PDF file. When
I inspect the PDF file it looks good. But when I insert it into Latex the
axis labels and the header (and all other text and numbers) are gone.

I am using Texworks on Windows and have the following in my preamble

   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx,color}

To include the PDF file i write

   \includegraphics{filename}

I have done the same thing on a Mac and it worked fine.



Thanks

Henrik

stefan witzel asks for the ability to
"re-use" a theorem with the same number
as the original.

    I'm using the amsthm-Package and number my theorem within sections, i.e.

    \newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[section]

    Now I would like to quote a theorem from the end of the paper in the
    introduction with its original number (which is 9.1 in my case).
    Of course I could do so by manually setting the counters:

    \setcounter{section}{9}
    \setcounter{thm}{0}
    \begin{thm}
    ...
    \end{thm}
    \setcounter{section}{1}
    \setcounter{thm}{0}

    but this destroys the idea of automatic numbering, because if my
    theorem becomes Theorem 9.2 because it is preceded by Lemma 9.1, it
    has the wrong number in the introduction.
    When I once had the problem of quoting a theorem *after* it had been
    stated, I used the following makros the save and recover the counters:

    [...]

    But how can I can obtain the number before the actual statement (using
    the \label)? I imagine there should exist solutions to this, but I did
    not find them on the web (and I don't know enough about
    makro-programming, to extract the necessary information from the
    \label-data myself). Many thanks in advance!

the test file attached below uses \label
to identify the theorem number, and also
allows for multiple "re-used" theorem
numbers.  re-using the theorem text is
left as an exercise for the reader.

Of course.

The first file is the original PDF file and the second file is the latex
output (also containing the Latex code).

Why not generate TeX code directly with R's pictex() command?

Both your pdf and your latex output look fine to me, including heading
and labels, etc. in the latex output. I strongly suspect the problem is
that your pdf figure uses Helvetic and Helvetica-Bold fonts which are
NOT embedded in the file, so whether you can see them, or whether they
might be substituted by other fonts, is dependent on the rest of your
system and the application you use to view the latex output with.

I attach a version of your figure that uses embedded Nimbus fonts
instead of Helvetica. (I generated this by printing your pdf to a file.)

Try this on your system. If it works, you might then explore if/how you
can force your R to embed fonts in its output. Or use acrobat or
something else to embed the fonts.

Steve,

I think you are right. When i opened the Latex output on my home computer (a
Mac), it looked fine. So the problem should be with the viewing application
on the computer at work.

Thanks for the help.

That is probably because the MAC contains thousands of fonts, that are 
not available (by default) on other systems.

That being said. Why doen't R embed the fonts? Isn't there an option for 
that in R?

If you use R on a Mac, make the graph ("Quartz ...") window active, and File -> Save.  This should produce a PDF file (default name: Rplot.pdf) with fonts embedded.  You may need to tell R to use Helvetica

par(family="Helvetica")

before plotting.  Otherwise Arial may be used.

If you downloaded MacTeX2009 or TeXLive 2009, pstricks is there.  But
one needs to be a clairvoyant to guess WHAT you have downloaded; so
please be specific

1) Yes, sure.

1a) If you have installed the TeX Live edition for Mac, PSTricks is
included. You can easily check with one of the examples from
http://www.tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi?file=examples

2) CTAN: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/

To install, you should create a localtexmf folder, etc., etc. (Takes some
time) Just try first if it hasn't been installed.

Even if it's not installed already, I strongly recommend to use the
package manager in order to install missing packages.  Whatever you
put into TEXMFLOCAL or TEXMFHOME, you have to maintain forever.

I'm sure that pstricks is installed already.  James said that he
installed everything.  What confuses me a bit is that later he said
"After installing LaTeX...".  I hope that this doesn't mean that he
installed scheme-basic (which provides minimal LaTeX support) instead
of scheme-full.  However, with the package manager it should be
possible to correct this quite easily.

There is absolutely no need to install anything from CTAN in
TEXMFLOCAL.  There are a few exceptions, though (inappropriate
licenses, ...).  But pstricks is free and is part of any recent TeX
distribution. 

BTW, unless you didn't tell the installer that it shouldn't install any
documentation (highly deprecated), you get documentation for each
package you've installed.  This means that you can be sure that a
particular package is installed if its documentation is available.

Thus, the easiest way to find out whether pstricks is installed is to
type

   texdoc pstricks

on the command line.  I'm advertising texdoc though I know that Mac
users are usually not as familiar with the command line as Linux
users, but IMO texdoc is extremely useful, though.  Please type

   texdoc texdoc

in order to get its documentation.

Regards,
  Reinhard

So it is there

along with MaxTeXtras.zip, and let it do its thing. For example, I
have software called TeX Live Utility and TeX Live Manager in the TeX
folder. Text-wise, everything works great, and I can even embedded PDF
files as figures, and make tables, and so on. But when it comes to
pstricks commands, nothing. In my files, I write the command
"\usepackage{pstricks}" at the top, along with other related package
commands (such as "\usepackage{pst-node}", "\usepackage{pst-tree}",
and "\usepackage{pst-blur}").

Pstricks does not work with pdflatex, and requires ordinary. In
TeXShop select Menubar Item  "Typeset" and in its lower part Select
"TeX and DVI" NOT PdfTeX



> The reason I was thinking that the package was not installed is because I have copied graphing commands for pstricks from verious User Guides into my LaTeX document, trying to get it to work with just simple stuff, like to have it plot a circle or a line (many different ways, many different commands), making sure that the commands were correctly positioned, typed, and so. But nothing seems to work (thus making me think the package was missing).

If package was missing there would be a complaint.

Subject: [texhax] output routine question: index "continued" lines
Message-ID: <op.vdwnmv2nwhlurl@jesse-pc.domain-not-set.invalid>

I'm trying to set up a basic output routine that will handle automatic  
insertion of "continued" lines at the top of pages where appropriate.  I  
wanted to see what the macros on pages 262-263 of the Texbook do, but I  
got an error ("Forbidden control sequence found while scanning use of  
\next") when I tried to use them with a simple example, replacing  
"\normaloutput" with "\plainoutput".  Has anyone else gotten these macros  
to work?

More to the point, how can I modify an output routine (say, \plainoutput)  
to tack on one or two extra lines at the top of a page when necessary, and  
then remove the same number of lines from the bottom and put them back at  
the top of the list of things that did not make it onto the current page?

All of my attempts have resulted in the same type of error that results,  
for example, from changing

	\output={\plainoutput}

to

	\output={\plainoutput!}

In other words, pages were ejected until some limitation was hit.  (In my  
case, I got a "TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=2500000]"  
message.)

Thanks for any help.

Because every time \output is threaded, it tries to append
a shriek marker to the current page; you would want to
look into the guts of \plainoutput to see how you could
intercalate additional  material without causing this
infinite loop.  A simple example is as follows; this
shews the simplest output routine, followed by one that
append a single line containing "!".

\output = {\shipout \box 255 }
Now is the time \eject
for all good men \eject
to come to the aid \eject

\end

\output = {\setbox 255 = \vbox {\unvbox 255 \centerline {!}}\shipout \box 255 }

Thanks for the info, and the example.  I think I've made a macro that does  
(almost) what I want.  I'd greatly appreciate any comments you have,  
especially about possible shortcomings.  One thing I know it fails to do  
is deal properly with the spacing between the added "!" lines and the  
lines of text.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\vsize=24pt%just two lines per page for this example

\newif\iflineadded% conditional to test whether ! has been added already

\output={%
	\iflineadded
		% if already added, do nothing
	\else
		\setbox255=\vbox{!\unvbox255}
		\global\lineaddedtrue
	\fi
	\ifdim\ht255>\pagegoal% if \box255 too high
		\unvbox255% send contents back to page builder
	\else
		\shipout\box255
		\global\lineaddedfalse

}


Now is the time

for all good men

Watch out interline glue and baseline distance.
The first line (hbox) of box  255 is \topskip in height, instead of 
\baselineskip, and anyway it won't adjust to the height of the added 
line because \unvbox doesn't do so.
On the other hand, when you \shipout box 255 with the added line, the 
later has its naturel height, not \topskip, hence pages with added lines 
will be shifted upward with respect to pages without.
(Although \topskip will be added in the content is sent back because 
\ht255>\pagegoal, reason why you might not see it on full pages.)

And when you do \unvbox255 you should return the \outputpenalty (if not 
10000), otherwise the last box of box 255 will be followed by a 10000 
penalty, which will probably do no harm unless TeX rebuilds exactly the 
same page plus the added line by shrinking here and there. (I.e. \ht255 
was indeed larger than \pagegoal, but then it was built withouth shrink.)

To be precise: the first box of box 255 is not \topskip in height, but 
is preceded by a glue so that glue+box height =  \topskip. Which doesn't 
matter for the line of reasonning.

Yes there is, in the pdf graphics device (see help(pdf) in R) but the help
file says that you do not have to specify this if you use standard fonts. It
did not do any good for me.

Another solution, besides using a different viewer, is to use "pdftops" and
then "pstopdf".


Thank you all for your help.

I think the general advise everywhere is to always embed all fonts.

and interestingly, I had one of our R users make me an eps with text it in.

The font it used was nicely embedded in the eps it self (I think it was 
helvetica)

hi,

I am a relative newbie in Latex and PStricks. I am trying to install the package on my computer. I have Miktex and using teXniccenter. I downloaded  PSTricks-TDS.tgz file from the website, after unpacking the files I cant find the read-me file for the installation.

Pardon me if i am asking stupid questions, I am not that good with computers. I would like to learn PStricks to make flow diagrams for my reports.

Thanks in advance,

you have to do nothing, MikTeX comes with a complete
installation of PSTricks!

For examples look at http://PSTricks.tug.org

    ctan.org/pkg/ifmtarg

is Donald Arseneau's solution. \@ifmtarg{arg1}{if}{otherwise} expands to "if" if "arg1" is nothing or a sequence of spaces, otherwise to "otherwise".

I know how to fool it, I guess you can fool any test that is expandable. Michael Barr's macro is not expandable. A non-expandable macro that is absolutely reliable is \IfEmpty with

    \def\IfEmpty#1{\def\Arg{#1}\ifx\Arg\Empty\FirstOfTwo\else\SecondOfTwo\fi}

with

    \def\Empty{} \def\FirstOfTwo#1#2{#1} \def\SecondOfTwo#1#2{#2}

With LaTeX, you may replace \Empty by \@empty, \FirstOfTwo by \@firstoftwo, \SecondOfTwo by \@secondoftwo without defining them.

Sorry for looking late at this.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Dear sir/madam,

I have managed to copy all the files of Pstricks package into their respective directories. However When I try to compile my code (using Latex=>PS) I get the error:

I can't find file 'pst-fp.tex'

When i check the PStricks folder in generic i do see that the file is present, do you know what the problem is?

Why?????  I'm not aware about any TeX distribution which doesn't
provide pstricks.  Can't you use the package manager in order to
install missing packages?

You neither said which operating system nor which TeX distribution you
are using.  If you have TeX Live, run the program "texhash" in order
to update the filename database.  MikTeX has a similar command but
because I don't have Windows, I can only propose to read the MikTeX
manual.

If you have further questions, please tell us

  1. which TeX distribution you are using

  2. and which operating system

Regards,
  Reinhard

you run texhash (texlive) or updated the file name data base
(MikTeX)?
However, MikTeX _and_ TeXLive have all PSTricks packages
by default!

No need for an extra installation.

I think you should already have it installed by your distribution; but if you don't or you want to install a newer version...

You can install packages in your $HOME in a directory texmf; if it doesn't exist, you can create it. You can put fontspec.sty, for example, in

~/texmf/tex/xelatex/fontspec/fontspec.sty

Remember, though, that if your distribution installs a newer version in a future update, every file in your ~/texmf directory takes precedence, so you have to be aware of that and delete any older file in ~/texmf.

Paul,

Thanks for the recommendation about \outputpenalty.  Am I correct in  
thinking that the problem of making the lines line up would be solved by  
forcing any lines that are added to the top of the page to have height  
equal to \topskip (for the first added line) or \baselineskip (for any  
others)?  If that works, is it the best way to make things line up?  (For  
what it's worth, \topskip and \baselineskip are equal in my current  
situation, but I don't want to rely on that.)

Stan

Which lacked the following: return a 0 penalty if \outputpenalty is 
10000, since \outputpenalty is 10000 if the break was at point without a 
penalty. The rest is ok (return the value of \outputpenalty).

That would work but that wouldn't be enough. You need to add the 
following between the added line and the unboxed 255:

\vskip\dimexpr(\baselineskip-\topskip-\prevdepth)\relax

(\dimexpr is an e-TeX primitive, whose meaning is clear, hopefully, even 
if you don't know it. Nothing crucial hinges on it, though.)
What we do here is mimick TeX's interline glue: we put the boxes' 
baselines at a distance that is \baselineskip by inserting such a glue 
minus the height of the bottom box (which we know is \topskip in height, 
since it's the first line of 255) and the depth of the top box (which is 
recorded in \prevdepth). If the added line is always the same you can 
specify the skip in advance and avoid the calculation.

But now I reread what you've written and realize you talk about the 
added "lines", with an "s". Which basically doesn't change much, except 
barring the first one there's no need to force them to anything since 
that's TeX basic job (placing lines where they should be). We had to 
take over that job above because of \unvbox. However, you never know, so 
perhaphs an example with things worked out?
(E.g. if those added lines are the result of an \unvbox then \prevdepth 
above won't work.)

Best,

Paul

Subject: [texhax] Use of multind.sty on WinEdt
Message-ID: <AANLkTimTiI0jFHyTYtCdRGECBvECAMXyATp8BqWKPBJH@mail.gmail.com>

To whom it may concern,

I am using MikTex 2.6 and  WinEdt 6. I am writing a book that needs an
"author" and a "subject" index. In the past I have only needed a subject
index, so I have simply used "makeidx" and when clicking on the TeXify
button makeindex is called and voila, the index appears. I expected the same
when using multind.

However, this does not happen when using multind. Running TeXify makes the
headers of both indices appear, but not the entries. Of course, the
necessary .idx files are created, but then makeindex does not create the
corresponding .ind files, as it is searching for the .idx file having the
same name as the current .tex file. So once I have run LaTeX I have to open
a command prompt and run makeindex on each of the .idx files. Then the
indices do appear with all their entries, of course.

So the issue is simple to know if there is a way to do this
automatically, Is this a purely WinEdt issue? I mailed them first, but they
told me it was a TeX issue and to contact you.

Thank your for your time and dedication.

Sincerely,
Alex

Subject: [texhax] tikz and making a hole
Message-ID: <AANLkTiko_jz34x0SY75sBoYg8tABBDAqGER2Iy0qeQAH@mail.gmail.com>

If I have a pgf/tikz snippet I can clip a piece of picture with a
command \clip, basically making the selection of the original picture
and throwing out everything else.

Meanwhile  if I want to cut out from the original picture and erase
selection, leaving the rest intact I can use \clip but the following
looks cumbersome:


\begin{tikzpicture}
\fill[red] (1.9,1.9) circle (.5);
\clip  (0,0)--(1.5,0)--(1.5,2) arc
(-180:-540:.5)--(1.5,2)--(1.5,0)--(4,0)--(4,4)--(0,4)--(0,0);
\fill[blue] (2,2) circle (1);
\end{tikzpicture}

Is there a better way? \fill[white] is obvious but it does not work in
many cases as it covers "background canvas" .

Works fine for me, with and without T1-encoding. But you will
perhaps have to zoom in to actually see the difference.

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc}
%\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}


\begin{document}

-- --- \bfseries -- ---

\end{document}

Subject: [texhax] Makros in \color
Message-ID: <4C191F04.7050503@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I want to abuse the \color makro a bit in the following way:

\color[RGB]{0 0 \themycount}

So the color will change as the counters change. This works. Trying it
with 2 counters:

\color[RGB]{0 \themycount \themycount},

I get errors from the \color-parser, I think:

! Argument of \c at lor@@RGB has an extra }.
<inserted text>
                \par
l.45 \begin{document}

Using the beamer class, this is a minimal example (other classes give
different error messages, but I guess it?s the same problem):

\documentclass{beamer}

\usepackage{color}
\newcounter{mycount}
\setcounter{mycount}{100}
\begin{document}
\color[RGB]{100 \themycount \themycount} test

\end{document}

So my question is: How to define a makro that gives a color depending on
the value of two counters?

cheers
Arno

The space between \themycount and \themycount is ignored, because
it ends the reading of the macro \themycount.

Best is to use the correct syntax that is compatible with the color
package:

\color[RGB]{0,\themycount,\themycount}

Yours sincerely
  Heiko Oberdiek

PS: If a command need explicit space tokens in the argument,
then this can be achieved by:

\begingroup
  \def\x#1{\endgroup
    \color[RGB]{0 \themycount#1\themycount}%
  }%
\x{ }

I hope this is no FAQ: Is there a LaTeX package capable of drawing atomic level schemes? I didn?t find anything on the internet, so I hope maybe there is already a package. Else I might try to implement one ?

Hi Arno,

not specific for atomic level drawings but in general Tikz / PGF is
always a good choice for LaTeX. You could define your standard elements
and reuse them to make it more easy. However, be warned this is a
massive package and requires some time to come into.

Check

http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/area/physics/

to find some example into the direction you are looking for. If you want
to implement something more specific, you might be intresting to do that
on the top of Tikz and create some kind of package which makes it easier
to use Tikz for your (and other peoples) purpose.
E.g.,
check

http://home.dei.polimi.it/mredaelli/circuitikz/index.html

where you will find a package based on Tikz to draw electrical circuits.

Hope that helps a bit

Torsten

Message-ID: <0A0B08D2-7E4C-4F84-8181-880101FA8CA6@fairness.com>

Jim Hafner (IBM Almaden Research) suggested that someone at TUG would likely have the technical expertise to help us with a software problem we're having translating certain math symbols from Microsoft Word into HTML. Most symbols and all foreign character sets we've tried work fine, but certain Greek letters and oversize parentheses (e.g. for multi-line equations) and ellipses have been the culprits so far...

We aren't using TeX, as most of the documents we're doing are natural language texts... but I do however have a semi-famous 1993 interview with Don Knuth to my credit <http://tex.loria.fr/historique/interviews/knuth-clb1993.html>, and I'm hoping that that good karma + Fairness.com being the beneficiary may be enough for someone to take a quick look and maybe recognize some known issue we're running into.

Below is a write-up of the problem... I'm sending some of the relevant files and screenshots in a separate email to avoid spam filter problems.

Thanks in advance!

Hi,

I've written a book using LaTeX and I am interested in including a dedication page.  My hope was that there would exist a command or environment that would accomplish this, but I've been unable to find such in books or online.  Is there a simple and standard way to include a dedication page?  I'm using the documentclass book.

Thanks,
Steve Chapin

For my PhD thesis, I used the following (dedication is made-up):

\documentclass{book}

% .. other preamble stuff ..

\newenvironment{dedication}
{
   \cleardoublepage
   \thispagestyle{empty}
   \vspace*{\stretch{1}}
   \hfill\begin{minipage}[t]{0.66\textwidth}
   \raggedright
}%
{
   \end{minipage}
   \vspace*{\stretch{3}}
   \clearpage
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}
\frontmatter

% ... other frontmatter

\begin{dedication}
To my cats, the mightiest of all cats.
\end{dedication}

% ... other frontmatter

%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\mainmatter

% ... mainmatter

\end{document}

Hope this helps,

Dan,

Curious that you would come to a TeX list for a question unrelated to 
TeX.  Your problems are due to the fact that MS does bizarre things in 
its typesetting.

Big Parentheses are rendered as three characters- a "top" cap and 
"bottom" cap, with an extendable middle section. Crude, but it works.

Your ellipsis problem is due to the lack of a specific unicode character 
on the client side: U+F0BC, which is in the Unicode "Private Use Area" 
(see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_of_Unicode_characters#Private_use_characters)

As for the greek letters coming up as squares.. I'm beat.

Why don't you try a web-based LaTeX math renderer?  For instance, your 
first big parentheses problem could be solved by entering this:

\begin{displaymath}
\frac{ mN \left ( 2 - 3 \dfrac{m}{N} - \dfrac{1}{N} \right )}
      { N^2 \left ( 1-\dfrac{m}{N}\right )
        \left (1-\dfrac{(m+1)}{N}\right )}
= \frac{2m}{N}
\end{displaymath}

into here:

http://hausheer.osola.com/latex2png

to get this (attached).

If you want to solve this problem using other means than TeX, it is 
probably better to look elsewhere.

Ellipsis in LaTeX math mode is \ldots , by the way; greek letters are 
such as \Alpha, \alpha, \Beta, \beta, ...

You're lucky I'm avoiding work right now.

Cheers,
-Brandon

Alternative solution (to making png images out of LaTeX snippets)
would be to use javascript renderers like
jsMath or its successor MathJax

http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/
http://www.mathjax.org/

which IMHO is the best for web

Dan asks on this list because he expects more expert knowledge here
than he can expect from any M$-Word related mailing list.  It's a good
idea to ask here.

I think that he deserves a good answer, even if he doesn't use TeX.

    http://ctan.org/pkg/rotating

for the LaTeX graphics package and 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/rotate

for a low-level way via dvips come to my mind. 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/rotate-textures

is for the commercial Textures distribution.

Fair point... The history of the question is that TUG was a referral of sorts (by Jim Hafner, IBM Research) from Joe Halpern (Cornell Univ., former JACM editor).

Very true! That was my hope and has already been realized; Brandon's initial explanation probably already solved and/or gives us good clues to a couple of problems we faced.... and my impression is that a quick glance was probably enough for him to diagnose those issues. Maybe others might have ideas (without too much pain or time) about the Greek characters rendering as squares?

***  I'll gladly give TUG an acknowledgment on our website and will be happy to provide a few complimentary accounts to TUG (including accounts for you two!) when our software is ready; I hate the idea of our software bombing on math symbols, so your help is really appreciated.

Note-- hopefully as we come to understand what the issues are we can maybe figure out how to support TeX documents too. The problem we face is that NowComment is meant as a general tool, not one specifically meant for math or technical documents... if and when people upload documents with math equations and characters embedded in them our software probably won't get any flag that it's math-related and so should get special processing... though maybe TeX or MathML would flag us in  ways that my developers can deal with but is beyond my level of knowledge.

Thanks again!!

PS-- I used to own Computer Literacy Bookshops in Silicon Valley, and we always promoted the TeX books and LaTeX and Metafont... Don Knuth spoke at our store and was an official "friend of the store".

Hi Dan,
it would be helpful to know the content of the HTML file.  If web
browsers print rectangles instead of glyphs, it's very likely that the
HTML file is correct but the font being used doesn't support these
glyphs.

Does your HTML file contain a tag 

     content="text/html; charset=utf-8"

? Without specifying a charset, everything is supposed to fail.

Could you provide a ***tiny*** HTML file which shows this error?

I ask for a tiny file because I recently wrote a program for debugging
UTF-8 encoded files.  The program is based on the databases provided
by http://unicode.org .  It converts

Subject: [texhax] a pdf font encoding question -- revised ( links instead
	of	attachments)
Message-ID: <4C1CC4FA.3040105@princeton.edu>

Dear "texhax",

Karl Berry suggested that I email you and texfonts at math.utah.edu for 
possible suggestions concerning a problem I have encountered.

It concerns base alignment of multiple text strings that are part of a 
piece of Mathematica graphics.

The problem is described completely in 
http://www.princeton.edu/~michaelb/nmr/projects2/mscp/ofsq.pdf 
<cid:part1.07000607.07020109 at princeton.edu>

The file http://www.princeton.edu/~michaelb/nmr/projects2/mscp/fofsq.pdf 
<http://www.princeton.edu/%7Emichaelb/nmr/projects2/mscp/fofsq.pdf> 
explains how ofsq was produced. It need not be read to understand the 
problem.

The problem arose in my use of Mathematica 2D graphics for the diagrams 
in a paper which I coauthored, that appeared recently in the Journal of 
Magnetic Resonance. 204 (2010) 189--195, doi: 10.1016/j.jmr.2010.01.009, 
2010. This need not be read to see the problem, either, but it 
reinforces my practical concern for a clean solution before I extend the 
software of that paper for its successor, and before I can help some 
colleagues draw other Mathematica graphics that contain text.

I am not being lazy in seeking help rather than pitching in to the study 
of the PostScript reference manual. I am 81, with a large backlog of 
material on other topics that I am trying to wrap up while I can.

I wrote Nelson Beebe for a referral last week, and he said he would try 
to look at the problem but not until the end of the Summer, so I saw no 
harm in casting further afield.

Subject: [texhax] biblatex and tex4ht
Message-ID: <871vc29mng.fsf@ericabrahamsen.net>

I know this question has been asked plenty of times before (because I've
been googling all day), but I've followed all the instructions I could
find, and I still can't get tex4ht to work with biblatex?it always tells
me that biblatex's commands are undefined.

I'm using TeX Live 2009/Debian on Ubuntu, with the newest version of
biblatex and an installation of tex4ht that I've patched according to
instructions here:

http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/bugfixes2.html

But still oolatex (I'm trying to get an odt file out of this) tells me
that citation commands (even something as simple as \cite) are
undefined.

Using a test file like this:

Subject: [texhax] Using "\pause" in Powerdot
Message-ID: <1277022912.17575.1380965283@webmail.messagingengine.com>

This is somewhat pstricks related, but mostly Powerdot related.

I would like to show working line by line in a gather*/aligned or align*
environment, using the "\pause" command" like this:

\begin{slide}[toc=,bm=]{Expand}
Expand the following (not-so-easy) binomial expressions:
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> $(a + b)^4$
        \begin{align*} \pause
        (a + b)^4   &= (a + b)(a + b)^3  \\ \pause
                    &= (a + b)(1a^3 + 3a^2 b + 3ab^2 + 1b^3)  \\ \pause
                    &= 1a^4 + 4a^3 b + 6a^2 b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4
        \end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


In the manual the authors of powerdot manage to pause a lstlisting.
However there are no examples for other math environments.

Is this possible at all?

The pstricks-related part is that if I were to show a part of a diagram
being drawn, it obviously wouldn't be possible unless I progressively
altered the diagrams slide by slide, correct?

Many thanks

Hubert

(sorry, might have sent a half-completed version of this by accident)

I know this question has been asked plenty of times before (because I've
been googling all day), but I've followed all the instructions I could
find, and I still can't get tex4ht to work with biblatex?it always tells
me that biblatex's commands are undefined.

biblatex and an installation of tex4ht that I've patched according to
instructions here:

http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/bugfixes2.html

But still oolatex (I'm trying to get an odt file out of this) tells me
that citation commands (even something as simple as \cite) are
undefined.

Using a test file called test.tex:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{biblatex}

\bibliography{test}

\begin{document}
Hello, I want to \cite[p. 50]{jolly_contributions} right here.
\end{document}
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

and a test.bib file:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
@Book{jolly_contributions,
    author    = {Richard Jolly, et al.},
    title     = {UN Contributions to Development Thinking and Practice},
    year      = {2004},
    publisher = {Indiana University Press},
}
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

and running:
mk4ht oolatex test.tex

I get the following error:


--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
?
(/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/tex4ht/ooffice-mml.4ht)) (./test.aux) (./test.bbl
)

--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

And there it dies.

I've got log files galore, and would be happy to provide any more
details if anyone thought they might have a solution to this?

Thanks!

you can simply use the $...$ notation or the \onslide macro

PSTricks uses PostScript, the reason why you have to run
latex->dvips->ps2pdf

or alternatively load the package auto-pst-pdf and then run

pdflatex --shell-escape file.tex

Hi,

I am trying to merge three completely fine stand-alone papers into a
dissertation meeting the requirements of the graduate college for my
school, the University of Illinois.  It was recommended that I use
resources produced by the Electrical Engineering Department found
here:

https://wiki.engr.illinois.edu/display/ECEThesisReview/LaTeX+Resources

The first two downloads on the left are a class file and the skeleton
dissertation file.  While I am not inexperienced in using LaTeX, I
have no experience with class files.  I have spent significant time
trying to get this to work and one thing I continue to struggle with
is to change the margins to 1" from the default of 1.5" by editing
line 185 which appears as follows:

    \thesis at dim=1.5in %% ECE: edit to adjust margin (SR)

and seems to me to be the one to adjust to reduce the margin to 1".
Yet, it has no effect when I do so.  I have contacted the office
responsible for supporting such work and they appear to be unfamiliar
with the workings of the program and I have yet to track down the
author.

1.  Can anyone comment, in general, if this is typically a complex
thing to change?  Does one simply modify the class file or does the
actual .tex file require change as well?

2.  If someone is able to take the time to download the two files and
let me know if there is anything else that I could look at, I would
greatly appreciate it.  I freely acknowledge this will be time
consuming and will be happy to provide a consulting fee in the form of
a Starbucks gift card if anyone so desires.

Thanks,

Tom

Message-ID: <AANLkTikQ1AxusL_bKkt-kNCVDKnfe3vb_gKRGuGs7Y44@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to create a thesis from a series of papers and one of the
requirements is that pt. size can be no less than 7.  I am trying to
ascertain how to ensure I do not break this rule.  In looking at the
manuals, my current understanding is that given a default font size
such as 12 pt this is \normalsize in the document and each of the
following reduce it by one:

\small, \footnotesize, \scriptsize, and \tiny

If this is true than my smallest font size would be 8pt if I use
\tiny.  Further, I could drop the \normalsize to 11 pt and still use
\tiny and I would be at 7 pt.

Can anyone confirm that I have grasped this correctly?  THanks.

Tom

Not really. For example, bk12.clo, which book class uses for 12pt, has

small:        11pt
footnotesize: 10pt
scriptsize:    8pt
tiny:          7pt

You can redefine sizes in your preamble; v.gr.,

\renewcommand{\normalsize}{\fontsize{11.5pt}{14pt}\selectfont}

Hi Tom,

to see what is changing, use the following.

in the preamble load layouts

\usepackage{layouts}

after \begin{document} have the layout printed:

\pagediagram

\pagedesign


In the next step I load the geometry package with

1in left and right..

\usepackage[lmargin=1in,rmargin=1in]{geometry}

and find no difference between this version and the version withput the
package. However if I set the margins to 1.5in each, the document clearly
gets longer. Without diving deeper I guess the margin is correct. I suggest
you print out a sample page and check the margins in the printed document.



Uwe

PS: To easily generate larger amounts of text I like the blindtext package.

Axel,

Thanks.  Can you tell me how you (or I) would know the defined font
sizes for a given class, like your book class example?  Where do you
look for such information, etc.  That is really what I need to know
but have been unable to decipher it myself.

    Thanks.  Can you tell me how you (or I) would know the defined font
    sizes for a given class, like your book class example?  Where do you
    look for such information, etc.  That is really what I need to know
    but have been unable to decipher it myself.

No guarantees, but I attempted to extract the size tables out of the
sources at one point for the unofficial latex reference manual I work on
from time to time.

Hope this helps,

Ah! This is good, not only for font sizes. (And, by the way, I made a mistake in my previous reply ---tiny size is 6pt as Karl Berry writes in said document, not 7pt as I said.)

As to where to look for this data, it is, in a TeXLive distribution, in

/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base

There you can look into bk10.clo, bk11.clo, bk12.clo, size10.clo, size11.clo, and size12.clo. As you might know, the first number is the font size, and the second the baseline skip; so, for example,

\newcommand\tiny{\@setfontsize\tiny\@vipt\@viipt}

means tiny is 6pt in size with 7pt baseline skip (leading).

Just as a point of interest, do you happen to know whether these
sizes are affected by document /class/ (article, report, book, letter, slides, ...)
as well as by document class size ?

Hi,

I wish to use AMS Euler as a regular font in my text. The AMS
documentation says that the font is defined only in math-mode - does
that mean that there's no way to do this?

I could enclose all of the text between $$, but that turns off other
essential things like line breaking, and becomes unusable. Is there some
other way?

Thanks,

i'm not somewhere that i can experiment
with how using euler as a text font can be
done, but it's possible.  however, the
results will be pretty awful,  because
the font is not kerned at all, and the
shapes are designed to be viewed as
individual letters, not to cohere as a
good text font should. -- even better
kerning wouldn't help there.

The euler-otf fonts worked, thanks. And yes, I'll keep the lack of font
features like kerning and ligatures in mind. I was just trying it out to
see how my text looked when typeset with Euler.

Karl and Alex,

Thanks very much for the replies.? The link Karl shared helps me to
know that I cannot use tiny if my base font is 12 and I am limited to
a minimum 7 pt size.

I used Alex' reply to navigate to the .clo files in the MikTeX
distribution.? While I can see what he shared I must confess, I am
unfamiliar with much of the code.

What is the difference between bk12.clo and size12.clo?

How does one interpret @vipt vs. @viipt, for example?? Are these set
in the program or do they have defined values in the language?

Thanks again,

Tom

Uwe,

This worked like a charm!

I did interact with one of the class authors and he pointed out that
by using the fullpage option to the thesis class I could get the one
inch margins (described in the user guide and I missed it) but it goes
to double spacing as part of the definition.  Thus, the geometry
package did the trick quite nicely.

May I assume that the layouts program provides approximate measures
which one must divide by 72 to get inch values or is it exact based
upon the file definition and the inch values reported in documentation
are thus approximate?

May I also assume one cannot use the \layouts package with the
\geometry package as I did not get any changes to the document in
pagedesign when using the \geometry package to constrain the widths?

Thanks again.

Tom

Yes, you can:

\documentclass[12pt]{book}
\renewcommand{\tiny}{\fontsize{7pt}{8pt}\selectfont}
\begin{document}
Normal size in 12pt. {\tiny This should be in 7pt}. And 12pt again.
\end{document}

See your log file ---book class uses bk12.clo; article, report and letter classes use size12.clo:

(/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/book.cls
Document Class: book 2007/10/19 v1.4h Standard LaTeX document class
(/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/bk12.clo
File: bk12.clo 2007/10/19 v1.4h Standard LaTeX file (size option)
)

6pt, 7pt

Thanks! I missed [even odd rule] switch.
I make even more holes


\fill[blue,even odd rule] (1,1) circle (0.5)
(3,1)--(3,2)--(2,2)--(3,1)  (2,0)rectangle (2.5,.5) (2,1) circle (2)
;


But returns "symmetric difference"

\fill[blue,even odd rule] (0,1) circle (0.5)   (2,1) circle (2)  ;

filling "uncommon" points.


However if I want only large disc without points of the small one I try

\clip (2,1) circle (2)  ;
\filldraw[ even odd rule] (0,1) circle (0.5)   (2,1) circle (2)  ;

which is "almost" perfect but returns a "ghost" line.

Funny, but making ***larger*** domain to clip solves the problem.


\clip (2.1,1) circle (2)  ;
\filldraw[ even odd rule] (0,1) circle (0.5)   (2,1) circle (2)  ;

Does it mean that even-odd rule affects even clip before?

Axel,

Thanks, yet again.  That is most helpful on the resize of \tiny and it is
only on your sharing it a second time that I finally see

vii = 7, etc.

    Just as a point of interest, do you happen to know whether these
    sizes are affected by document /class/ (article, report, book,
    letter, slides, ...)
    as well as by document class size ?

It is indeed an interesting point.  I wouldn't hazard a guess for letter
and slides, but I think for article/book/report, the answer is no --
only the doc class size option affects it.

(It's precisely because I wasn't sure and didn't track it down
completely that I didn't say anything about it in the doc.  I'd like to.)

Best,
Karl

Sorry for the late response.  But I woudn't redefine \tiny.  I simply
wouldn't use it.  My proposal is to redefine \tiny this way:

    \renewcommand{\tiny}{\errmessage{<some text>}}

Then LaTeX aborts and complains loudly if \tiny is used accidentally.

Problematic are subscripts and superscripts in math formulas.  They
are obviously controlled by \DeclareMathSizes.   

    http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/tutorial10/mathsize2.pdf

Since there is the \DeclareMathSizes macro, I assume that \tiny is
ignored anyway when typesetting math formulas.

I've seen in this tread that the .clo files were mentioned.  It's
quite odd to point casual users to them.  There's no need to change
them.  They are 16 years old now and if there is really the need to
change them, I expect that a macro package is available which does
such changes.  You can be sure that if such a macro package doesn't
exist (after 16 years) it's undesirable to change anything at all.

Convincing a casual LaTeX user to modify a .clo file is almost as
wrong as to convince him to buy "The TeXbook" in order to solve LaTeX
problems.

Please note that LaTeX's default values for scriptsize and
scriptscriptsize are fine for Computer Modern fonts because they
contain variants which are especially designed for these sizes.  When
using any other font, {sub,super}scripts are scaled-down versions of a
10pt font.  They appear too thin and should better be enlarged a
little bit anyway.  It requires some experimentation because the
visual appearence is what counts.

BTW, the arguments of \DeclareMathSizes are numbers, but they aren't
restricted to integers.

Just for the record, I received the newest TUGboat release today and
there is a related article "Mathematical typefaces in TeX documents"
written by Amit Raj Dhawan (page 27).  It provides samples of a math
formula typeset with various fonts.  There is also a comparison
between "cmr5" and "cmr10 at 5pt".

Please apologise the advertising. :)

That would be a solution, of course; but I don't think there is anything wrong with that. The first example I gave was about redefining normalsize, which I had to do in a book ---you just can't go without using normalsize.

Ah! Good point ---if the OP needs to use math, but can't use anything below 7pt, that would be a problem. But the document you refer to wonderfully explains in a few lines what to do.

The OP asked:

Well ---such information is in the bkXX.clo (for book class) and sizeXX.clo (for article, report and letter classes).

I never advised modifying .clo files! I clearly said

Yes, this is really good, as different font families might require different adjustments, though usually package writers take good care of that.

Yes, I have seen those examples ---very good to have a grasp on the complexities of font design.

Sure.  The OP assumed that he could solve his problem by
reverse-engineering LaTeX.  You told him how to proceed.  But I'm not
conviced that reverse-engineering LaTeX is a good idea.  There are
better solutions.

Sorry, but I can't see how you consider this reverse-engineering, and not \DeclareMathSizes, which you talked about in your previous email. And the OP asked how he could *know* which were the defined font sizes for a given (point size option in a) document class, where he could "*look* for such *information*".

There is nothing esoteric about examining sizeXX.clo ---"The LaTeX Companion", 2nd. ed., for example, says (p. 144)

>> ... if you select the option 11pt, one of its actions is to change the list defaults. In the standard classes this is done by loading the file size11.clo, which contains the definitions for the 11pt document size.


And, p. 373,

>> For best results, however, one needs to use a document class designed for the selected document fonts or, lacking such a class, to redefine the commands \normalsize, \footnotesize, and so on...

Well ---the only thing the OP needs is to ensure that the smallest font size in his document is 7pt, to comply with some in-house rule established by people who usually don't know anything about typography.

Thomas,

I would recommend you two books especially ---the above quoted "LaTeX Companion", and Kopka & Daly: "Guide to LaTeX"; you can see them (and other titles) here: http://www.tug.org/books/ 

In general, there is a wealth of information in tug.org; for example,

Subject: [texhax] Measurements inside TeX
Message-ID: <1277284706.5406.17.camel@localhost>

Hi,

I'm using XeTeX to typeset some text, which will be placed inside a
Scribus document. Since there's a lot of repetitive work involved, some
automation is done using Python.

My question is this: I need close interaction between Scribus and TeX
for the margins and other typographic detail to come off well. Is there
some way I can determine the height and width of a certain block of text
in TeX?

Something like: \textwidth{Lorem Ipsum} and \textheight{Lorem Ipsum}.

I know that TeX does a lot of calculations internally, but I just want
the final results to use in a subsequent \vspace, assuming that my text
block is a complete paragraph by itself.

In fact, a macro of the type \currenty will do, so that I can then do
something like: \vspace{availabley - \currenty}

Thanks,
Mukund

\vspace indicates that you are using LaTeX (XeLaTeX), so consider \settoheight, \settowidth, and \settodepth, cf.

arrow to be"in the middle":

\draw [->] (0,0)--(0,2);
\draw (0,2)--(0,4);

seems to be cumbersome; it becomes really bad if the line is curved by

2) I want path like


\draw [->] (0,0)--(0,2)--(1,1)--(0,0);

but with arrow tips

\draw [->] (0,0)--(0,2);
\draw [->] (0,2)--(1,1);
\draw [->] (1,1);--(0,0);

also seems to be too cumbersome;

2') I want path like in 2) but with an arrows like in 1)

Are there any shortcuts?

Thanks!

I would like to produce a 'branching arrow' symbol as seen in the attached example.

Its scale should be about the size of the 'arrow' that is used when indicating a 'function'.

I have been unable to find something in the symbols list.

I appreciate suggestions.

You can create it yourself, for instance with TikZ/PGF.  It provides
good support for arrows.

   http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/base/doc/generic/pgf/version-for-pdftex/en/pgfmanual.pdf

Another possibility is to use the arrow from a font (the same you are
using when indicating a function) inside a LaTeX picture environment.
The second arrow must be rotated.  This is supported by LaTeX's
graphics package.  But some manual tweaking is required.

  Reinhard

Even if it's mentioned in "The LaTeX Companion" I don't see any good
reason to bother a casual user with such low-level stuff.

I fear that redefining \tiny has no impact on math formulas.

Why do you assume that they don't know anything about typography?
They noticed that fonts smaller than 7pt are incomprehensible.  This
is a reasonable decision.  At least unless the fonts used are
especially designed for this particular size.  And only Knuth's fonts
support "design sizes".

Well ---if it bothers you so much, I can advise Thomas to forget all about \tiny (not even \relax ing it) and use a new command:

\documentclass[12pt]{book}
\newcommand{\mytinysize}{\fontsize{7pt}{8pt}\selectfont}
\begin{document}
Normal size in 12pt. {\mytinysize This should be in 7pt.} And 12pt again.
\end{document}

Legibility depends sometimes more on the font design than on point size ---I typeset a book with Lucida fonts using 9pt for main text (that is, for \normalsize) with a 30pc text width; whereas 9pt in MinionPro is hardly OK for footnotes. You can't specify a minimum point size in general ---you have to specify minimum point sizes per font family.

A few months back, we had in this list a similar but more annoying problem caused by a bureaucrat ignorant of typography ---the author was told to use 12pt for his text, but said bureaucrat (obviously checking the document with Acrobat) told him it wasn't right ---he was using 11.96pt instead of 12pt! Martin Schr?der solved the problem advising the use of bp, instead of pt. As the solution redefines \normalsize, you might not like it :)

Well, there were the nifty multiple master fonts which had a design axis (e.g., Minion and Adobe Jenson)

Even now, some OpenType fonts come in multiple versions for explicit support of design sizes (e.g., Garamond Premier Pro and Arno Pro).

A note for the OP --- if the size is being checked in Adobe Acrobat you'll want to use bp for measurements instead of pt --- 7pt == ~6.972bp

William
(who got very tired of explaining why 10pt type measured as 9.96 (PostScript) points in Adobe Acrobat)

Good morning all,

I am writing a large document with many labels for tables and figures. Often
I can't remember what that label is when I want to reference it later in the
text. Does anyone know of a way to create a list of all the labels used for
an entire document that can then be handily referenced? I am using emacs,

Thanks in advance!

if you are an emacs user why don't you just use the auctex + reftex 
extensions?

Then you can get nice overviews of all your labels, and if they are 
prefixed in a certain manner, you can even have it show only labels 
related to figures, or equations etc.

I use reftex in conjunction with ordinary latex-mode, and I find it
very useful.

   M-x info-goto-node RET (reftex) RET

should get you started.

grep newlabel texfile.aux

will show you all your labels, where your source is texfile.tex. And if
you want to make it prettier, I guess you could redirect the output to a
file labels.tex, e.g.,

grep newlabel texfile.aux > labels.tex

and then write a short label_main.tex that has

\documentclass{article}
\renewcommand\newlabel[2]{#1 & \newsublabel#2\\}
\newcommand\newsublabel[2]{#1 &  #2}

\begin{document}

\begin{tabular}{lcc}
Label & ref & page \\\hline
\input{labels.tex}
\end{tabular}

\end{document}

This generates a table with the label, the reference, and the page
number. If you have lots, you might want to replace the tabular
environment by longtable or supertab or something else to split it
across more than one page.

When I run pdflatex on this simple file:

pdfTeX warning (dest): name{page.2} has been referenced but does not

pdfTeX warning (dest): name{page.1} has been referenced but does not

If I remove \usepackage{pdfpages} or \usepackage{geometry} or even
just the [showframe] option then everything is fine.

Any ideas on what is going on here?

Please try 

   \verb!\dots! 

and ask again if it doesn't solve your problem.  I used an exclamation
mark as a delimiter in the example above.  But you can use any other
character instead.  See also:

Dear Jonathan,
> Do you have or can you recommend

> home edition.

Do I understood correctly that until know you ask your customers who use
LaTeX to convert it into MS-Word to send it to you ?

LaTeX files are pure text files. You could even open them up in Word if
you like. They look a bit like program code but most of the time far
less complicated as you might think. Often, 95% of the file is clear
readable text and 5% are commands which ask to format the text and set
the layout.

As Alan suggested already there are plenty editors which have many
helpful functions, assisting you to use LaTeX.

In your case as a Pro, I would highly recommend to learn at least the
basics of LaTeX and ask your customers to send you the LaTeX files
directly. This looks much more professional, does not create another
cumbersome workload on your customer side (LaTeX to MS-Word conversion
for proof reading is really a head shot for any LaTeX user, no really!!!)

Its not hard, you might have to learn only the markup commands like to
set text bold, italic, etc. You might learn the basics of paragraph
formatting and how to compile a LaTeX file to generate a PDF.

You are in the lucky situation, that you get finished LaTeX files which
you only have to modify. Thus, it should be easy for you to learn just
what is needed to create your modifications.

BTW. if you are willing to learn more about LaTeX you can gain from many
other tools around the LaTeX world. E.g. you could use a version control
system which would allow you to see all changes you did to a manuscript
at all stages; to revert those changes, to keep different versions for
references, etc.

Please read:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX
and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors

as for Editors, you have to understand that most of the editors will not
give you a "What you see is what you get" WYSIWYG, like MS Word. They
are more focusing on assisting you to write correct LaTeX files. Finally
they help you in generation of a PDF or DVI file which contains the
final result.
Many people use WinEdt (commercial but IMHO worse the money, or
TeXnicCenter (open source) for MS Windows. Real pros like even more
basic editors wich they can heavily configure to there own needs like
Emacs or Vim.



Hope that helps a bit

Torsten

There you go. All this time it was right under my nose. Although I really do

I don't quite understand what you want in the end ---do you want to convert LaTeX files to Word and then use an application like InDesign or Quark to do the editing and final copy for printing and publishing?

It's an \AtBeginDocument race, the package atbegshi (loaded by
pgfpages but also e.g. by hyperref) changes \shipout at
\AtBeginDocument, the showframe option of geometry does it too. And
this second definition wins and traps the anchors. 

It works if you load pgfpages after geometry. Then the
atbegshi-definition is used which seems to give the correct frames
too (that means probably that geometry should better use the hooks
of atbegshi too instead of its own hook).

What I use to see the labels is
\usepackage[notcite,notref]{showkeys}
which puts the labels in the margin.  This is much more useful than a list 
of labels since I can see in the preview or printout what each label 
labels.  Obviously, I take this out before the final printout.  I guess 
without those options I would also see \ref and \cite in the margin, 
although that would have only marginal utility.

Subject: [texhax] Distiller fails to convert ps to pdf, missing Helvetica,
	Zapf Dingbats
Message-ID: <201006242239.33106.jeremy@acjlaw.net>

Hi,

I have a form created using latex with hyperref and eform packages.
The form is in Helvetica font and the various widgets for text input
use helvetica font for text and numbers, and Zapf Dingbats for symbols
such as check marks and  radio buttons.

I am able to convert my latex file to pdf on linux using either dvips
or dvipdfm. However, I need to use Adobe Reader restricted features
such as saving. So I bought Acrobat 9.0 Pro Extended for my Windows XP
laptop, thinking I could use Acrobat to activate extended features for
my pdf. And indeed my pdf now has extended features in Windows. But as
soon as I copy/email/rsync the file over to my linux desktop, Reader
says the file has been modified and therefore extended features are no
longer available and to contact the document's author for the original
unmodified pdf. So it looks like  using Acrobat to enable extended
features in a pdf for Reader is buggy. I can copy back the pdf from
Linux to Windows and lo and behold the extended features are re-enabled
in Reader for Windows. But I need my form to work on any OS, not just
Windows.

So instead of creating the pdf entirely on my Linux desktop, I decided
to just create the postscript (using dvips driver) and then use
Acrobat Distiller to create the pdf on Windows.

But Acrobat is unable to distill my postscript file to pdf,
complaining about two missing fonts: Helvetica and Zapf Dingbats (both
apparently used by hyperref/eforms for creating widgets).

I cannot seem to force these fonts to be embedded in my postscript:

latex form.tex
dvips -Pdownload35 -Ppdf -Pamz -Pcmz -G0 form.dvi
ps2pdf form.ps
pdffonts form.pdf

name                                 type              emb sub uni

------------------------------------ ----------------- --- --- --- ---------
ZapfDingbats                         Type 1            no  no  no 12  0
Helvetica                            Type 1            no  no  no 15  0

SEKMAF+NimbusSanL-Bold               Type 1C           yes yes no 22  0

My Linux desktop is running Gentoo with complete dev-texlive/texlive-
latex-2009 installed.
I also have MiKTeX installed on my Windows laptop.
There is a setting "LW35 URWkb" in /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
--- I don't know if using ADOBE or ADOBEkb would make a difference.
I have "dvipsDownloadBase35 false" per default, but I override that
setting on the command line.

Thanks for any help.

Hello,

Why the "oversigned" numbers don't work with PSTricks, while it's possible with TeX?

for instance in PSTricks:
  \rput{--30}(0,0){fool text}    ----> gives out an error

in TeX:
 \newdim\tempdima
 \tempdima = --30pt            -----> no error!

Well, there were the nifty multiple master fonts which had a design axis (e.g., Minion and Adobe Jenson)

Even now, some OpenType fonts come in multiple versions for explicit support of design sizes (e.g., Garamond Premier Pro and Arno Pro).

A note for the OP --- if the size is being checked in Adobe Acrobat you'll want to use bp for measurements instead of pt --- 7pt == ~6.972bp

Good morning all,

I am writing a large document with many labels for tables and figures. Often
I can't remember what that label is when I want to reference it later in the
text. Does anyone know of a way to create a list of all the labels used for
an entire document that can then be handily referenced? I am using emacs,

if you are an emacs user why don't you just use the auctex + reftex 
extensions?

Then you can get nice overviews of all your labels, and if they are 
prefixed in a certain manner, you can even have it show only labels 
related to figures, or equations etc.

I use reftex in conjunction with ordinary latex-mode, and I find it
very useful.

   M-x info-goto-node RET (reftex) RET

should get you started.

grep newlabel texfile.aux

will show you all your labels, where your source is texfile.tex. And if
you want to make it prettier, I guess you could redirect the output to a
file labels.tex, e.g.,

grep newlabel texfile.aux > labels.tex

and then write a short label_main.tex that has

\documentclass{article}
\renewcommand\newlabel[2]{#1 & \newsublabel#2\\}
\newcommand\newsublabel[2]{#1 &  #2}

\begin{document}

\begin{tabular}{lcc}
Label & ref & page \\\hline
\input{labels.tex}
\end{tabular}

\end{document}

This generates a table with the label, the reference, and the page
number. If you have lots, you might want to replace the tabular
environment by longtable or supertab or something else to split it
across more than one page.

The bug is in geometry, if option showframe or showcrop are used.
Then geometry redefines shipout in \AtBeginDocument, but saves
the \shipout at package loading time. Thus each redefining of
\shipout is lost in between.

Workaround:

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\makeatletter
\AtBeginDocument{\let\Gm at shipout\shipout}% right before geometry
\makeatother
\usepackage[showframe]{geometry}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}
p1\newpage p2\newpage p3\newpage
\hyperlink{page.1}{1}/\hyperlink{page.2}{2}/\hyperlink{page.3}{3}/
\end{document}

Package geometry should at least move and copy the line
  \let\Gm at hipout\shipout
right before each
  \renewcommand*{\shipout}{...}%

Also the way geometry redefines \shipout can be improved,
see package atbegshi "2 Method of \shipout overloading".

Yours sincerely

Hi all,

I am trying to write a small package with some special drawing 
instructions. Inspired by the articles by Joseph Wright, I am using 
expl3 and xparse. Now I have problems using expl3-Syntax together with 
tikz-instructions: tikz needs explicit spaces (no problem with 
\ExplSyntaxNames) and explicit colons as in [domain=1:3].

So my question: how to handle the colon in the domain-value? I don?t 
want to fall back on l2? syntax in my code at this position ? is there 
any way to tell tikz inside an expl3-code to recognize a colon?

cheers

Reinhrad, Brandon

I'm following up on our email from last week where you graciously answer several of our questions. We have been trying to do more research ourselves so we can ask as intelligent questions as possible, but dealing with Word's Symbol font is apparently a very tough problem and in an area we are not experts in.

A. I'd like for our software to be able to handle TeX documents. Two general questions come to mind (presumably easy ones, so I haven't tried to research TeX before asking):

   1. Would it be trivial or difficult for our software to render TeX input documents for the Web? Would LaTeX and/or other variants be the same?

   2. Does TeX have any built-in translaters for dealing with legacy documents from MS Word? What do other people do when confronted with problematic Word documents????



B. In case helpful to you... I came across someone who appears to be knowledgeable about Symbol font issues from the Microsoft community:  Jay Freedman <http://www.word.mvps.org>. One comment I found in a post of his:

http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/35945671/symbol-font--not-unicode-compliant-how-to-searchreplace.aspx

compliant (for example, the ?? [Registered] glyph in Symbol comes from codes
x00D2 OR x00E2 (or their decmial equivalents; two different versions of it!),
instead of the proper Unicode x00AE)....

Jay Freedman answer: 
Word's way of hiding the "true" font of symbols inserted through the Insert Symbol dialog is a historical leftover that has caused untold heartburn for two decades.  The convoluted method for finding and replacing them is given at http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/FindReplaceSymbols.htm.



C. Here's our most recent attempt to explain our situation better:

We're doing some text --> HTML conversion work (Ruby on Rails in a Linux environment) and are running into problems rendering MS Word documents that have Symbol font characters (e.g. characters created via the Insert Symbol menu). 

Here's one stripped down, step-by-step example of the problem:

  1. I create a simple 1-line Word 2008 (Mac) document using the default Cambria font.
  2. I type a few standard characters, then use Word's Insert | Symbol command to insert the Greek letter epsilon into that document.
  3. I do a "Save As HTML".
  4. Both Safari and Firefox can load the resulting HTML file, but both render the inserted epsilon character as a square (in effect, fail to render it).
  5. When I view the source that resulted from the "Save As HTML" operation it shows that the epsilon character has been converted to the ASCII letter "e" AND rendered in the Symbol font (changed from Cambria).

Our processing stack is quite a bit more involved that this, and there could be issues with Symbol at one or more point in the stack (and maybe other fonts in addition to Symbol might cause problems as well!?). 

One article we found simply recommended not to use Symbol font for the web. That's probably good advice, but training users "how to do things right" isn't an option as users of our software are not from any one organization, we may have to deal with legacy documents, etc.

What software approaches (automated!) might be available to us to detect and deal with problems so that Word documents can be rendered for the Web?


As before, all suggestions and informational tips will be appreciated...

You can use xparse without needing to be inside code blocks. So If you 
only need

\NewDocumentCommand\SomeCommand{m}{%
   \pgfkeys{domain=1:3,#1}% or whatever
}

then there should be no issue.

If we assume that you are using other expl3-like functions, then 
obviously life becomes a bit more complex. Spaces are still not really 
an issue, as "~" is used for a space

\ExplSyntaxOn
% Spaces ignored
\pgfkeys { key~with~spaces = value }
\ExplSyntaxOff

Colons are a bit more awkward, as you've observed. I'd use 
\tl_to_lowercase:n in the usual TeX methods

\group_begin:
   \char_set_lccode:nn { `\@ } { `\: }
   \char_make_other:N \@
\tl_to_lowercase:n {
   \group_end:
   \pgfkeys { key~with~spaces = 1 @ 3 }
}

For simple documents, this should be straightforward.. but TeX is very 
complicated and LaTeX has tons of specialized packages, so getting the 
details to work can be problematic.  The old standby is latex2html but it 
seems to be unmaintained: http://www.latex2html.org/


There are plenty of programs which will render TeX fragments on-demand on 
the server side.  All you need is a local TeX distribution (texlive is 
common on linux systems; MikTeX on Windows; MacTeX on mac) and something 
like:

http://www.mayer.dial.pipex.com/tex.htm

to render for the web. [this looks like a port to rails:
http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/latex_render_helper ]

I don't think TeX has any facility to deal with word, but there are other 
programs.  wv (for word viewer) looks promising:

http://wvware.sourceforge.net/

Also have a look at AbiWord, which is a full word processor (and 
commandline tool) and uses wvware for its word conversions. I just tried 
"abiword --to=html my_file.doc" on a word-2003 doc and got satisfactory 
results at the commandline.  It appears to render to unicode and the few 
symbols I had in my document came out correctly.  The tables looked like 
garbage though.

http://www.abisource.com/

I use catdoc to extract 'content' from .doc files for use in TeX. 
According to the webpage, it "doesn't even try to preserve MS-Word 
character formatting" but it has the capability for user-defined 
substitution of special characters if they come out as unicode.

http://wagner.pp.ru/~vitus/software/catdoc/

As far as 'problematic' files go, I basically expect to have to go through 
each file and fix problems manually.  I just don't do it often enough to 
worry about.

I don't know how well any of these programs work with Office 2007/2008 or 
later files (.docx on windows).  My sense is that everything stopped 
working with the new formats.  (sometimes I can't even open them in word!)

Hope this helps,
Brandon

Deyan--- thank you for this additional information... will share this with the team.

I had hoped the TeX community had developed an automated tool of some kind to catch and fix Symbol font problems, but it sounds like it's a manual process for you... oh well!

Try tex4ht.  As an example, see http://vntex.sf.net . It's created by
tex4ht.

Subject: [texhax] anti-widow package
Message-ID: <20100629064243.25320@gmx.net>

Hi all,

I have just finished Paul Isambert?s article about ?strategies against widows? in the latest TUGboat. I really like the ideas Paul presents and wondered whether it would be possible to turn his code into a very usefull LaTeX package. Because many people surely at least would want to test whether their document could look nicer with those strategies, but are afraid of writing/copying that much low level TeX hacks.

Any suggestions/comments regarding this idea? As Paul writes in the last paragraph of his article, the \everypar and \output routine are ?complex objects? in LaTeX ? is it possible at all to implement the anti-widow strategies?

I envision a package the user can load and adjust to his needs (choose one of the presented strategies, adjust parameters and so on) and so doesn?t have to rewrite all the code. Furthermore, it could contain makros to enable the author to manually adjust some hard cases.

Paul, would that be ok for you? I would try to package your code nicely, of course considering any wishes if you have such.

cheers
Arno

latex2html is probably not the recommendation to make anymore, 
especially since MathML came along. There are a few actively developed 
and maintained tools which already have a very wide coverage of LaTeX's 
capabilities. To name a few:

1. LaTeXML
http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/
2. TeX4HT
http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/
3. Ttm
  http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/mml/

LaTeXML and TeX4HT can also produce images, if MathML is not a popular 
choice for your setting.

Just as a note, there is already a server version of LaTeXML, which one

purpose. Could be interesting if you actually want to webify your

Dear LaTeX fans:

I?m trying to insert a glossary in my thesis using WinEdt 6. After checking
my Perl installation and glossaries package several examples work properly,
but I don?t know why specially with my thesis cannot obtain the Glossary,
all the references and labels appear in the final pdf, but cannot see the
glossary like in the other examples.

I think it is because my .gls file is empty, but don?t know why.

Here is my .glg file:

This is makeindex, version 2.14 [02-Oct-2002] (kpathsea + Thai support).
Scanning style file D:/Documents D/Tesis/LaTex for thesis/My

Do you have any idea?

J?rgen Fenn's topical TeX catalogue lists several tools at CTAN

     http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#html

only 

    http:/ctan.org/pkg/tex2page
    http:/ctan.org/pkg/tex2rtf

and perhaps

    http:/ctan.org/pkg/webguide

as a guide are missing. The TUG page

    http://tug.org/interest.html#web

also lists tools that are not available on CTAN.

     http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#html

only 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/tex2page
    http://ctan.org/pkg/tex2rtf

As a guide, webguide is included in the section on references and manuals:

Hi,

I could not write a vertical text in the edge of paper (margin) like in the
attached file.

Understood.  Unfortunately in your earlier message
you wrote "vertical text like a bar", which I interpreted
too literally.  I know how to write a bar in the margin,
but writing rotated text is beyond my current abilities.

Actually, Jim's example works like \rlap{blah } with LaTeX (Jim certainly knew but thought better not to tell) where \rlap is used for \lefteqn, for the tabbing environment, and for thanks-footnotes. So it is useful to append something on the right of a centered line without affecting the alignment. So much for "pathological".

Hi Lorena,

you clearly have errors in the glossaries file. can you tell us, how the respective files look like?

Hi Uwe,

Thank you for your answer.

I?m sorry, you?re right, it?s better if I show you my glossaries files:

Here you are:

*.glg file*

This is makeindex, version 2.14 [02-Oct-2002] (kpathsea + Thai support).
Scanning style file D:/Documents D/Tesis/LaTex for thesis/My
thesis/Antecedentes.ist...........................done (27 attributes
redefined, 0 ignored).
Scanning input file Antecedentes.glo...
!! Input index error (file = Antecedentes.glo, line = 1):
   -- Illegal space within numerals in second argument.
!! Input index error (file = Antecedentes.glo, line = 2):
   -- Illegal space within numerals in second argument.
done (0 entries accepted, 2 rejected).
Nothing written in Antecedentes.gls.
Transcript written in Antecedentes.glg.

*.glo file
*
\glossaryentry{sample?\glossaryentryfield{sample}{\glsnamefont{sample}}{a
sample entry}{\relax }|setentrycounter{page}\glsnumberformat}{\es at scroman
{iii}}
\glossaryentry{sample?\glossaryentryfield{sample}{\glsnamefont{sample}}{a
sample entry}{\relax }|setentrycounter{page}\glsnumberformat}{\es at scroman
{iii}}

*.gls file*

*NOTHING*

As I told you before, I?ve tried with minimalgls.tex example and other found
through the web and I get the ouput and the glossaries, of course. I cannot
explain why in my thesis not if I am only copying and pasting the code.

Thank you so much

Hi again Uwe!

I don?t know why there is a question mark there, but I also wondered about
that. Then, I compared this output with the minimal.glo file in order to
have a clue...

Here you are the file I mentioned:

\glossaryentry{sample?\glossaryentryfield{sample}{\glsnamefont{sample}}{a
sample entry}{\relax }|setentrycounter{page}\glsnumberformat}{1}
\glossaryentry{aca?\glossaryentryfield{aca}{\glsnamefont{aca}}{a contrived
acronym}{\relax }|setentrycounter{page}\glsnumberformat}{1}
\glossaryentry{aca?\glossaryentryfield{aca}{\glsnamefont{aca}}{a contrived
acronym}{\relax }|setentrycounter{page}\glsnumberformat}{1}
\glossaryentry{sample?\glossaryentryfield{sample}{\glsnamefont{sample}}{a
sample entry}{\relax }|setentrycounter{page}\glsnumberformat}{1}
\glossaryentry{aca?\glossaryentryfield{aca}{\glsnamefont{aca}}{a contrived
acronym}{\relax }|setentrycounter{page}\glsnumberformat}{1}
\glossaryentry{aca?\glossaryentryfield{aca}{\glsnamefont{aca}}{a contrived
acronym}{\relax }|setentrycounter{page}\glsnumberformat}{1}

As you can see the question marks are there too, the only difference in my
thesis is the final argument "{\es at scroman  {iii}}". I?ve tried to delete
it, but it appears again when the example is compiled.

Thank you for your attention!


Lorena

Make a small (it should use as few packages and text as possible)
but complete tex-file which generates your problematic glo-file so
that we have a file for testing. The \es at roman is probably caused by
the spanish option of babel. 

> I?ve tried to delete it, but it appears again when the example is compiled.

Well yes, that is the idea of an automatic glossary: That is gets
updated at each run/change of your document. 

Btw: Learn to quote: don't top post and delete text you are not
referring to.

I think it'd be a very good idea... but I also think it will probably be 
very hard to do. First, LaTeX relies heavily on vertical glue (in every 
sectioning command, for instance), whereas my code assumes fixed grid 
typesetting. So you'll have to spot every place where vertical glue 
might appear, with every class/package, and neutralize it. Second, 
you'll need a good understanding of LaTeX's output routine, and I'm not 
even sure it allows such a thing to be done. Someone with a better 
understanding of it than I have may give you a better appreciation, 
though, even indicating to you the places where the code should appear...
I didn't mean to discourage you, actually what I've said is less an 
exact appreciation of LaTeX than the expression of some of the reasons 
why I quit using it. You're absolutely free to use the ideas as you 
wish, mi c?digo is tu c?digo. So go on... and good luck!
> As Paul writes in the last paragraph of his article, the \everypar and \output routine are ?complex objects? in LaTeX 
I think I said they were `supposed to be complex subjects' (and not 
especially in LaTeX), by which I meant (regarding the output routine 
particularly) that they aren't addressed very often (as compared to 
macros, for instance).

... and even: If #9 contains (working) assignments only, it will create an \hbox of zero width, so this macro would consider #9 empty. So #9 could be the content of a macro package,  e.g., latex.ltx (unless something) ... Is latex.ltx empty?

The glossaries file contains \es at roman in the location part. Makeindex 
can't cope with that so you'll have to use xindy instead. Minimal example:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[spanish]{babel}
\usepackage[xindy]{glossaries}

\makeglossaries

\newglossaryentry{sample}{name={sample},
