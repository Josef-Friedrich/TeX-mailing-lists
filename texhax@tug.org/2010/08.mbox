I think any text editor (except probably notepad) will be ok.  I use
vim, ymmv.

PS. I assume you already knew how to use chinese ime.

Well we need to see the code that is causing the problem.

Can you provide a minimal example? Try to include a few packages a 
possible such that you still get this error.

I have seen it before but I've forgotten what caused it.

Do you really need, the enumerate package, enumitem and paralist?

Note that \usepackage[shortlabel]{enumitem} gives the same functionality 
as the enumerate package.

I do not remember if paralist touches the standard classes

\enit at after comes from package enumitem, it is defined in the
begin part of environment enumerate. The problem is a clash
with package enumerate that redefines the begin part of
enumerate without redefining the end part. Thus unless enumitem
is used with option loadonly, the two packages can't be used
together.

Thanks for this tip! It is solved now, I removed package 'enumerate' and
use \usepackage[shortlabels]{enumitem} instead.  

Interestingly, even though earlier I had compilation errors, pdf output
was correct, it was just a bit annoying to go through that many errors
each time. 

Cheers,
Olga

Thanks for this explanation! I guess 'enumerate' is redundant in my
case. Recently I made some updates and only after that these two
packages started clashing.

Kind regards

that is why we always recommend users to try to fix errors as soon as

I suppose that the question is how to enter Chinese characters on a
keyboard which only supports ASCII.  

Mahi,
you need at least a program which maps multiple keystrokes on an ASCII
keyboard to Chinese characters.  There are different programs
available for different operating systems but I never used one of them
and thus can't advertise a particular program.

A cross-platform approach is to use Emacs.  Emacs handles such things
internally.  You have to select an appropriate "input method" for
Chinese.  In the menu bar, select:

  Options => Mule (Multilingual Environment) => Select Input Method

Then type the word "chinese" (without the quotes) and press the <TAB>
key.  Emacs displays a list of known input methods for Chinese then.

I don't understand Chinese, so you have to find out yourself which
input method is appropriate for you.  And as Bill already said, you
have to be familiar with at least one Chinese input method.

Another advantage of Emacs is that a single keystroke is sufficient in
order to toggle input methods.  Quite convenient if you have Chinese
and Cyrillc in the same file.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,

I teach a subject that uses Slackware Linux as a teaching
tool. Students need to install the Operating System and
in the Lab notes, I discuss how to do this. Slackware uses
a menu system that is based on the old IBM PC extended character
set. When I try to put this into a verbatim or Verbatim
environment, all of the lines disappear.

Thanks for your help.

When you say "all of the lines", to which "lines" do
you refer : "lines" of text (in which case, no idea)
or "lines" that make up the box characters (in which
case there is an distinct likelihood that such
characters do not exist in any monospaced font
that comes as standard with TeX).

Hi Reinhard

Thanks for the reply. 

I installed the emas and choose the option as per your instruction, i am able to select chinese language, but unable to insert any chinese characters from this editor, please suggest.

I suppose that the question is how to enter Chinese characters on a

keyboard which only supports ASCII. 



Mahi,

you need at least a program which maps multiple keystrokes on an ASCII

keyboard to Chinese characters. There are different programs

available for different operating systems but I never used one of them

and thus can't advertise a particular program.



A cross-platform approach is to use Emacs. Emacs handles such things

internally. You have to select an appropriate "input method" for

Chinese. In the menu bar, select:



 Options => Mule (Multilingual Environment) => Select Input Method



Then type the word "chinese" (without the quotes) and press the 

key. Emacs displays a list of known input methods for Chinese then.



I don't understand Chinese, so you have to find out yourself which

input method is appropriate for you. And as Bill already said, you

have to be familiar with at least one Chinese input method.



Another advantage of Emacs is that a single keystroke is sufficient in

order to toggle input methods. Quite convenient if you have Chinese

and Cyrillc in the same file.



Regards,

 Reinhard

Together with the right encoding, provided by project `inputenx'.

Message-ID: <m1iq3ssil8.fsf@cam.ac.uk>

Hello,

I am setting up chktex on a project of mine and it warns about missing
"~" in front of \cite. I use BibLaTeX and hence this question:

 Does BibLaTeX automatically insert a ~ in front of citation commands?

Thank you very much.

I think Don is talking about the characters in the Extended ASCII table
(characters 128 - 255) but specifically these are characters 179 to 218.

I don't think it's possible to simply copy these characters into TeX as
TeX is only able to process characters 0 to 127?

Sorry ... just as I wrote earlier: the documentation of the array package (ctan.org/pkg/array) explains a command for defining new LaTeX table column types much like \newcommand. The rest would be straightforward macro programming using \newcounter, \stepcounter, and \ifnum (I like TeX's primitive conditionals) or the ifthen package (ctan.org/pkg/ifthen). 

With Plain TeX, you can similarly define some one-parameter macro \CondCol such that the template line of \halign contains \CondCol{#}.

Cheers,

Thanks.

I'm looking at the apa-good.bst source here:

http://github.com/whenders0n/thesis/blob/78c5338cfb25b2a0e3b7b31e4babee394d5b1088/extrrrastuff/APA/apa-good.bst

Note that on line 978 (FUNCTION {inbook}) there are two "if$"
statements (this is a postfix language, like postscript or RPN
calculators).  The editor fields are only output if the author is
empty (I'm not sure what's going on in the other branch since I've
never found a good reference to bst).  In any case, you might try
copying the bst file and replacing it with a new one in your local
directory with a slightly different name, and change lines 980-990
(inclusive) to

  author empty$
    { format.editors "author and editor" output.check
      editor format.key output
    }
    { format.authors output.nonnull
      editor empty$
      'skip$
      { format.editors output.nonnull }
      if$
    }
  if$

I've certainly removed functionality here, since I don't know what's
up with crossref, but this could maybe possibly get the job done for
you...?

A while back, I defined the following set of macros for this.  The
changes can be made invisible and a final version produced by
uncommenting the first three \newcommands and commenting out the last
three

\usepackage{color}

\definecolor{LBRed}{rgb}{0.9,0.1,0.2}
\definecolor{LBBlue}{rgb}{0.4,0.3,1.0}

%\newcommand{\refadd}[1]{#1}
%\newcommand{\refchange}[2]{#2}
%\newcommand{\refdel}[1]{}
\newcommand{\refadd}[1]{{\color{LBBlue}\relax #1}}
\newcommand{\refchange}[2]{{\color{LBRed}\relax #1}{\color{LBBlue}\relax #2}}
\newcommand{\refdel}[1]{{\color{LBRed}\relax #1}}

I see three solutions:

  1. Use LaTeX macros as suggested by Dan. There are a few packages do
     this. Go to CTAN by topic and check them out.

  2. Use external tools to automate. I have heard latexdiff is great.

  3. Some version control tools or editors offer fine-tuned word-to-word
     differences. For example, git diff --color-words v1..v2 and Emacs's
     diff-mode can highlight word differences for a while now.

My favourite is 3 as I am a big fan of git and emacs ;)

Best wishes,

Leo

As I already said, I don't speak Chinese and thus I'm not familiar
with Chinese input methods.  Hence I can't tell you which keystrokes
lead to a particular Chinese glyph.  When I select

     Options => Mule => Select Input Method => chinese-b5-quick

and type "ad1", then the glyph ? is displayed, can you reproduce it?

If you see rectangles instead of Chinese characters, you have to
install Chinese fonts.

What do you get if you run

     emacs --version

? Hopefully 23.*.

Dear TeX group,

We are done with a paper that we plan to publish, but facing one problem:

The authors of the paper decided to be listed in an alphabetical order... the problem is how do we insert a footnote in the FIRST page of the paper that says: "Authors are listed in alphabetical order." (My understanding is that it is not like other footnotes.)

Your advise is highly appreciated.

Thank you in advance,

Dani.

If you're using plain TeX:
Why should the first page be different? Is it a title page? What happens with
simply \footnote*{The authors are listed in alphabetical order}?

If you're using LaTeX: anybody else?

Here is what I use for unnumbered footnotes (acknowledgements, usually) 
before footnote one on the first (or to force a note continuation on any 
other page).

\long\def\notezero#1{
   \insert\footins{\ADDbaseline=10pt % need a baseline and font 
specification here,  These happen to be my way of doing it.
   \eighthalfpoint\noindent{#1}
   \vskip2pt} %A fudge, but it works for me
   \textpoint} % return to the normal text size (My XXXpoint macro is 
quite complex, probably more complex than you need

---This is, by the way, a very common convention, preferred by many 
editors to the somewhat misleading use of footnote#1 as a vehicle for 
acknowledgements.

You'll need to purchase the font first (get the Type 1 version for PC if you want to use it w/ dvips or pdflatex)

Then you'll need to process it w/ fontinst to get the support files, put those in the proper places, refresh the filename database and run updmap and associated utilities to get things working.

Or, you could use xelatex and just purchase the OpenType version just use a simple fontspec call.

That's bad advice. pdflatex can handle TrueType and there are several
tools for easily installing OpenType fonts for pdflatex (e.g.
otfinst). And of course XeTeX and LuaTeX can handle OpenType natively.

Get OpenType, if you can (unless you have good reason to still use
dvips).

Subject: [texhax] SO: What to do with this hyperref note on amsmath?
Message-ID: <m1eiecn83u.fsf@cam.ac.uk>

Hello,

I put a question? on stackoverflow but I seems to get no answers.

It is about a note (copied below) in hyperref README:

,----[ /amsmath/ ]
| The environments equation and eqnarray are not supported too well. For
| example, there might be spacing problems (eqnarray isn't recommended
| anyway, see CTAN:info/l2tabu/, the situation for equation is unclear,
| because nobody is interested in investigating). Consider using the
| environments that package amsmath provide, e.g. gather for equation. The
| environment equation can even redefined to use gather:
| 
| \usepackage{amsmath}
| \let\equation\gather
| \let\endequation\endgather
`----

But the space between 'hello' and 'equation' is different in this example:

\documentclass[twocolumn]{article}
\begin{document}
hello
\begin{equation}
a+b=c
\end{equation}

hello
\begin{gather}
  a+b&=c
\end{gather}

\end{document}

So technically gather cannot replace equation. Thus, in a document using
both hyperref and amsmath, what is the best replacement for equation?

Thanks.

Leo

I have experienced strange alignment problems but they are not
confined to equation but rather to gather


http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/texhax/2010-March/014510.html



There is a bug in amsmath, and AMS techies seem to investigate it


I do not think that equation is more problematic than gather or align

If the license for the font in question allows one to, and you don't mind having multiple versions of the font in your .pdf bulking it up (say one sets text in figures using the OpenType version, the converted .otf is effectively a different font, resulting in a larger file).

A solution for LaTeX that is independent from the driver

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{atbegshi}
\usepackage{ifpdf}
\newcommand*{\thehorigin}{1in}

You can generate a mirrored postscript file from a dvi file thus :

   dvips -h mirr.hd input.dvi -o output.ps

Because that's what the lines:

\begin{tabularx}%
{\linewidth}{l|Y||Y||Y||Y||Y||Y||Y||Y||}

tell it to do. Note that the first character is an "ell" not a vertical
rule. Reading the directive gives:

left vert Y vert vert Y vert vert Y ...

Try this one instead:

 {\linewidth}{||l||Y||Y||Y||Y||Y||Y||Y||Y||}

or modify accordingly.

PS It would be better to post a *minimal* example rather than one
requiring various packages, etc. I suspect if you constructed such a
minimal example you might have answered your own question in the
process.

Hi all,

In pdflatex i have to include pdf files that have 2 or 3 pages

I do this with:

\usepackage[final]{pdfpages}
....
\includepdf[...]{filename}

but a new page is taken on the line of this instruction.

Is it possible to complete the page and then have the insert of the pdf 
pages?

Thanks in advance

But what is the connection of your problem with the

If you have a new problem, then please start a new thread.

Hi all,

I'm starting to use the arrayjobx package to store a somewhat large amount 
of data in an array (~1,800 elements).  I'm curious, what sorts of 
resource limits am I likely to run into as I store larger arrays?

Also, is there an upper limit for the value of \dataheight ?

You cannot do it that way; Latex fits the title stuff at the top of the 
page AFTER reading enough stuff to know approximately where to cut the 
first page. A way to accomplish what you want is to make your flushright 
text part of a multi-line title and push the appropriate line to the 
right using various tex/latex incantations. Alternatively you can 
manually typeset the title stuff without using \title and the related 
commands such as \author, etc.

I have been trying to use:
\begin{titlepage}
\end{titlepage}

But then I would get a page break after the title page. How can I
suppress it?
\nopagebreak doesn't seem to work.

Kind regards

Pstricks ...

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{pstricks} % wonderful set of graphics tricks! 

\begin{document}

\rput[tl](7.0,3.0){% location on the grid ...

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
this is the abstract
\end{abstract}

some revised text
\end{document}
------

You can move the psgrid and rput wherever you want, but by putting it
at the start of the title you may have more control.  The coordinate
system (shown by psgrid) is relative to where you call the rput.  On
slides (made with powerdot) I start with a \vspace{8.6in} and then I
can put anything anywhere I want on the whole slide.  But I don't have
an equivalent trick for regular pages (yet).

BTW, \normalsize does not take an argument, the following
curly braces are not necessary.

The same trick can be used with the standard LaTeX environment picture.
This has the advantage that it does not depend on a special driver.

Alternatives:
* Package textpos
* Package atbegshi: \AtBeginShipoutNext + \AtBeginShipoutUpperLeft
* ...

Hi.  I finally got the \href command deciphered and have been putting
active links in a document.  I currently lack printer access.  Can
someone share the following with me?

1.  While it is obvious when viewing a document in adobe acrobat there
is a link or something special about such text, it does not appear
that it includes underlining for the printed version.  Is this
correct, does the printed version lack any indication that a group of
words is a link?

2.  If it is not obviously a printed link, can someone share what
technique they implement to make this obvious in printed .pdf
documents?

Thanks,

Tom

Then print to a PostScript file and view it with Ghostscript.

Except for options `colorlinks' or `frenchlinks'.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.1008141528470.19521@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

I got a query from someone trying to use my diagram macros in conjunction 
with revtex.  Finally, I decided to try to track it down.  What follows is 
really strange and I could not begin to imagine how it could be done. 
Here is a sample file:

\documentclass{revtex4}
\newdimen\ul
\ul=.01em
\showthe\ul
\begin{document}
\end{document}

Try it; you get the message that \ul=0pt.  If you put it after the 
\begin(document} you get the correct value.  How can this be done?  Lest 
you answer that I should not be using \newdimen, I point out that the 
diagram macros work fine with plain tex (and anything else I have tried 
them with).  Of course, \ul is a basic dimension in them.

Can anyone explain what is going on?

Update: I tried changing \ul to \UL in the above file and the results were 
the same.  If I changed em to ex, same result.

It's the "em"; somehow RevTeX is selecting the null font.

Heiko,

Thanks for the reply.  I did not see how using Ghostscript would tell
me whether or not a printed .pdf document would display links as
underlined or provide some other indication to a reader.  Even the
colorlinks option was not obvious in the printed version.  I finally
used the \underline command once I returned from travel and could
print a page.

Fellow listers,

I am a complete newbie on LaTeX for presentations and would finally
like to leave the womb of Powerpoint.  I read the Presentation
Material chapter from the Guide To LaTeX 4th edition but still remain
a little confused.  If I wish to create .pdf slide shows and will use
basic drawing diagrams (boxes, arrows, etc.) what is the best way to
proceed in terms of packages/classes?  Do I need to identify what
drawing tools I will use before choosing a presentation method?  Any
suggestions would be greatly appreciated before I begin trying to
master something that may be a blind alley down the road.  Thanks very
much.

Sincerely,

Tom

Take a look at beamer. It is in ctan and development happens in

Take a look at Beamer would be my advice, too.

Especially the "have one source, generate slides and paper" feature is
something cool that I will make more use of during the next weeks. It comes
with an excellent manual as well.

I've been pretty happy the the recently developed powerdot in
combination with the cool pstricks.  Generally I displace down the page and then
can place objects anywhere I want using:

% atat % section start
\begin{wideslide}{Advanced Molecular Information Theory}
\vspace{8.6cm}\hspace{0cm}% start at lower left point
% \psgrid(0,0)(-20,-20)(20,20)%
%
\rput[tl]{0}(1.65,8.0){% across down, inches
\parbox[t][3.0cm][t]{3.0cm}{% \parbox[c][\height][t]{\width}%
{\rotatebox{90}{\scalebox{0.6}{\includegraphics*{slidesfigs/ecorI.eps}}}}
}%
}%
%
\rput[tl]{0}(2.0,8.5){% across down, inches
\parbox[t][3.0cm][t]{10.0cm}{% \parbox[c][\height][t]{\width}%
{\par
\vspace{11pt}\hspace{4.5cm}
{\large\textbf{Information \emph{versus} Energy}
}%
}%
}%
}%
\end{wideslide}

So the vspace sets us to the lower left corner.  The coordinate system
can be seen by unearthing psgrid.  Then the two rputs place objects
where I want on the grid.  Text goes inside parboxes (or in this case
also a graphic).

In powerdot one can pause or set parts to appear at different times. 
Also, hyperlinks work.

My slides done this way from my talk at the recent meeting
Perspectives in High Dimensions are at:

http://www.case.edu/artsci/math/mwmeckes/perspectivesInHighDimensions/slides.htm
http://www.case.edu/artsci/math/mwmeckes/perspectivesInHighDimensions/schneider.pdf

The example above is slide 15.

Probably not.

Ghostscript allows you to *view* the printed version.

Thanks.  Should have checked the ctan- mailing lists (or, I see now,  
checked the CTAN notes on TUG).

Revtex does not select a font until the beginning of the document,
so em is zero until then.

I am trying to include a photograph (saved as a .jpg file) in a letter written with \documentclass{letter}.

The following code
***************************************
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{letter}
\usepackage{graphics}
\signature{Signature} % 
\begin{document}
\begin{letter}{Addressee\\address}

\opening{Dear Addressee:} % 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	\includegraphics*[0,0][72,72]{DSCF0036.jpg}
\end{enumerate}
\closing{Sincerely,} % 
\end{letter}
\end{document}
***********************************************
(where the file DSCF0036.jpg is in the same folder as the source file for the letter)
produces no error message, but produces the letter without the picture.
Increasing the box size to [0,0][720,720] only increases the size of the space left open 
for the picture (to a full page).

I realize that this may be a problem with my viewer (I'm using the standard preview viewer that is associated to TeXShop) but is there a way for me to be sure the picture is actually being included?  Or am I omitting something obvious that would lead to this behavior?

You're welcome.  I see that my comments on rput were wrong:

> \rput[tl]{0}(2.0,8.5){% across down, inches

that should be across and UP and cm since the coordinate system
provided is the usual Cartesian one.

Your problem stems from the picture format. I assume you directly generate
pdf using pdflatex, then you can use either pdf or png format for images.
No other formats are recognized by pdflatex.

You can convert to png using some image processing software. convert
(ImageMagic) would be my choice. Others on this list might give you better
advice on this toppic.

Hope that helps,

Is that really true, Susan ?  This is the standard ending to all my

I think jpg is directly supported. It could be that some 'draft' option
is turned on.

Wrong. pdftex also handles jpeg and jbig2 files.

Also JPEG and JBIG2 are supported. And the PostScript output of MetaPost
is supported at TeX macro level (by Hans Hagen). Thus the
driver file pdftex.def for LaTeX's graphics/graphicx package
knows the following extensions:
            .png,.pdf,.jpg,.mps,.jpeg,.jbig2,.jb2,%
            .PNG,.PDF,.JPG,.JPEG,.JBIG2,.JB2%

\usepackage{graphicx}

\includegraphics{DSCF0036}% or \includegraphics{DSCF0036.jpg}

Of course, the driver must support JPEG files, this is the
case for pdfTeX in PDF mode. Because pdfTeX in PDF mode
includes the driver backend, the size of the image is known
to pdfTeX.

Users of latex/dvips can use jpeg2ps to convert the JPEG file
to EPS.

If you're talking of including graphics, as opposed to \includegraphics,
then there's also the /RichMedia route to consider. For instance:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\mbox{}
\def\R{\space 0 R}\def\use{\immediate\pdfobj useobjnum}%
\def\my #1 {\pdfobj 
reserveobjnum\expandafter\edef\csname#1\endcsname{\the\pdflastobj}}%
\my RMcontent \my RMsettings \my RMconfiguration \my RMinstances \my 
RMinstance
\my RMasset   \my RMparams   \my RMbinding       \my RMassets    \my 
RMconfigurations
\my RMwindow
\pdfannot {%
/Subtype/RichMedia/NM (crash)/F 4/RichMediaContent \RMcontent\R 
/RichMediaSettings \RMsettings\R
}%
\use\RMcontent   {<</Assets \RMassets\R/Configurations 
\RMconfigurations\R>>}%
\use\RMsettings  {<</Activation <<
   /Type/RichMediaActivation/Condition/PO/Configuration 
\RMconfiguration\space 0 R
   /Presentation<</Style/Windowed/Window \RMwindow\space 0 R>>
>>
>>}%
\use\RMconfiguration {<</Instances \RMinstances\R/Subtype/Flash>>}%
\use\RMinstances {[\RMinstance\R]}%
\use\RMinstance  {<</Asset \RMasset\R /Params \RMparams\R>>}%
\use\RMparams    {<</Binding \RMbinding\R >>}%
\use\RMasset     
{<</FS/URL/F(http://www.youtube.com/v/qB8m85p7GsU?version=3)>>}%
\use\RMbinding   {/Foreground}%
\use\RMassets    {<</Names[()\RMasset\R]>>}%
\use\RMconfigurations  {[\RMconfiguration\R]}%
\use\RMwindow    {<<>>} %
\end{document}

includes a YouTube video narrated by Arthur C. Clarke .
But with a bit of elbow grease, instead of a video, you could use 
the FLEX SDK to produce a swf that acts as loader for pretty much 
any graphic format you care to name. And with an embedded
local host server, it's even possible to incorporate an
interactive TeX session inside a TeX-generated PDF. Therefore, 
although SWFs are generally maligned, they do open up many interesting 
document possibilities.

Beautiful thoughts... paradoxically named "precepts", in total contradiction
with point 1. I guess that's part of the game, but freedom has a frightening
tendancy to produce fanatics. (Allright, Buddhist monks aren't among the world's
biggest fanatics, admittedly.)

Seems to compile OK on my box.
log file looks normal.
Produces no pages of output I guess because it is a completely empty 
document.

Message-ID: <D55306B1-F7A8-4885-A7A0-742713AB5BE0@me.com>

My book is 606 pages long. It is a single file plus the .ind file and125 pdf illustrations.

Here are the packages used:

amsmath
amsthm
amsxtra
\RequirePackage[mathscr]{eucal
amssymb
latexsym
amscd
graphicx
color
mdwlist
chngcntr
color
booktabs
url
fixltx2e
verbatim
enumerate
xspace

Typeset time as reported by "time":

real	0m2.595s
user	0m2.527s
sys	0m0.063s

that is, 3 secs. pdf file is 4.4 MB.

Now if I use the microtype package( the book  is now 3 pages shorter):

real	0m35.443s
user	0m35.155s
sys	0m0.115s

typesetting is over 35 secs. pdf file is 4.6 MB.

My iMac has 8GB memory; the whole ms with illustrations is 
tiny in comparison: about 40 MB.

Anything I could do to speed up this typesetting?

I think the OP is still wondering at which .tex lines TeX replaces \nullfont by the font acting in typesetting. I didn't remember well myself, but the OP's .log indicates that the \textfont's (TeXbook p. 153) are chosen at the first $, which triggers LaTeX's \check at mathfonts.

    Uwe.

Hans Hagen's TUG 2010 paper indicates something similar, while I don't have own experience with microtypography. Glyph expansion offers more alternatives to try in line-breaking than ordinary typesetting (I guess). 

I liked your General Lattice Theory, thanks!

Well done, Uwe : you have saved me a great deal of work
in having to track that down !  I promised Michael I would
investigate today, but did not yet feel awake enough to start.

Michael, I wonder whether this provides the hook you need :
once the various \textfonts have been set, is the probability
sufficiently high that one of these will also be the default
text font that you could make use of it in your em-based
calculations ?  If not, then I think that you could still
make use of my earlier suggesting (deferred definition of
\em) by wrapping all the definitions concerned in one large
macro which is then called \AtBeginDocument.

Lua.

Seriously, ditching bibtex in favor of lua half a year ago was the best
thing tex-related I ever did. Calling external programs is outdated by
now, as is the restriction to the .bib format. With lua you can use
standard .bib markup, xml, s-expressions, you name it -- just have to
write a parser? Only think about the multi-language sorting which always
was a pain with 8 bit programs: with lua you won't even notice it as
long as you're using appropriate sorting tables (albeit they're not
trivial to build). Same for bibliographies with sections, bibliographies
that output tables etc.

(Reasonably advanced macro packages already provide uncountable lua
tools for string manipulation, sorting, .bib parsing, and the likes.)

In general, expect things to go a bit slower when using lua, but in many
cases you'll save one tex run as there's no need to externally process
data.  (For some bib styles as author-year that build citation strings
(e.g. ?Einstein 1905b?) based on the whole set of cited works, you
still need a second run, though.) But as long as you don't typeset
volumes of bibliographic data, it won't be noticable at all.

Don't get me wrong: the bibliographic capabilities---and that was
synonymous with bibtex+jurabib back then---were the main reason for my
switching to tex in the first place. But since we have lua in our tex
machine there's just no point in calling some third party binary which
needs to be fed a cryptic input and returns code that is strongly biased
towards latex. Sure, these days you still have to implement a lot
yourself, but (no prediction, just a guess!) you can expect some user
friendly biblatex-compatible solution in the long run, which will make
it very convenient for latex users to forget about the 8 bit era.

The ?Greatest bibliographic system? is not _for_ tex anymore, it's
already _inside_ tex.

Dear Philipp,
 
your advertising lua reminded me again that I heard nice things about
luatex. So I ventured towards its homepage, trying to get a start.  Looks
like my search fu is quite bad, as I did not find any beginner's guide or
any easy or advanced examples.
 
For a project of mine I would like to use lua if it really makes things
easier. In this project I need
- an index
- a glossary
- automatical double typesetting (done via perl script right now), same
  text in two different fonts
  
At the moment I have that working using pdflatex and external programs (and
doing the glossary completely by hand as I find it too tedious to tweak
makeglossary to my needs).

Do you have any hints for me where I should start if I would like to use
lualatex instead?
 
Thanks in advance,

	Susan

The best introduction is:

  http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/pil2/

This book is really worth its money.  The first edition of the book
(describing Lua 5.0) is available online:

  http://www.lua.org/pil/

The tutorials are very helpful too:

  http://lua-users.org/wiki/TutorialDirectory

The LuaTeX manual describes LuaTeX specific extensions.

Enjoy programming in Lua!

  Reinhard

I share Philipp and Reinhard's enthusiasm for LuaTeX and I use it everyday.
However, sorry for the pessimism, there's no good introduction to LuaTeX yet.
Reinhard's link is excellent indeed (and let's add the reference manual:
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/), but it won't tell you how to use LuaTeX. And
the LuaTeX manual is minimalist and not very beginner-friendly, which may be
explained by the fact that, well, there are other things to do for the time
being.

To my knowledge, and I'd be very glad if anybody proved me wrong, there's only
one way to LuaTeX for the moment, and that's the hard one. Experiment, try to
understand, ask questions on the mailing list, and trust time. Now for a
somewhat more cheerful note: that's what I've done, and now I'm a very happy
LuaTeX user -- even though my general education in programming was close to zero
(well, it's a bit better now). So it can be done.

And I'd add that what you need to understand LuaTeX is not so much being good at
Lua than exploring how TeX works: Lua mastery won't help if a list of nodes
means nothing to you. (This point of view might just stem from the way I use
LuaTeX, though.)

Ah, and a definitive upbeat note: LuaTeX is hard, but you are more than rewarded
using it. It's so [insert f-word here] powerful!

Howdy,

I've been reading the Lua Manual and also have the Lua Reference Manual. That's all well and good but is there some manual that lists the LuaTeX hooks and, especially, examples of their use?

Good Luck,

I agree that the TeX related part of the manual is not very
beginner-friendly.  If anybody is willing and has the time to write
tutorials, I recommend to simply hijack the Context Wiki:

An excellent idea, I think. It's rather ConTeXt-oriented, though. Wouldn't it be
nice to have a real LuaTeX wiki, i.e. format-independent, to learn the basics?
(I'm asking because I'm totally unable to set up a wiki; I'll be more than happy
to contribute but I can't give the starting push.)

Thanks for the hint.  I wasn't aware of it.  On the other hand, though
it's true that the Context Wiki is quite ConTeXt-oriented, LuaTeX
doesn't depend on Context.

I'm convinced that it's counterproductive to have two LuaTeX Wikis.
Who is maintaining http://luatex.bluwiki.com/ ?

In the history I see that Elie Roux and Khaled Hosny were involved.
That's fine, but who is actually maintaining the Wiki?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yannis Haralambous, says the first page, which is surprising. Anyway
"maintained" doesn't seem to apply, does it?

personally I'd follow the advice Paul already gave: experimenting for
yourself is the most fruitful strategy. There's no such thing as a
?LuaTeXbook?, and the luatex reference makes sense only as kind of an
?Appendix K? to Knuth.

I somewhat hesitated with this reply, but it almost always pays off to
have look at how Hans did it. With respect to index building the place
to start is strc-reg.*[1] which, unfortunately, heavily relies on other
context internals (such as sorting and structures). Can't tell how this
would map to a latex environment if at all. YMMV. Aren't the common
latex modules supposed to work with luatex? If so, I'd try to migrate
to luatex first and then gradually replace/add functionality with lua
code.

Depends on what the glossary should look like. There was some discussion
on this topic on the context list a while ago where I posted some
makeshift ?solution?[2] but again I can't tell how much of it can be
latexified.

> Do you have any hints for me where I should start if I would like to use
> lualatex instead?
If there's no lualatex wiki yet, why not start one at wikia? There
already are some hits at stackexchange[3]. Also, you might be interested
in this thread: http://www.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-context/2010/050017.html

Surely "Appendix L", if you study how the Appendices
got the letter/titles that they did :-)

Damn, I'd never noticed. That must be the ultimate secret to become a TeX

Well, it's clear that Don foresaw the development of LuaTeX since
he obviously stopped the series of appendices before pre-empting
the use of the letter "L" :-)  Presumably he's still waiting for
Karl Berry to write Appendix K : "Kpathsea, or how TeX finds files" ...

Sure, but this requires creating some Appendix K, about something that can be named similarly!   

However, I realize the index must be the last appendix of a book ... so the TeXbook is like TeX: frozen for good.

Ok, Knuth didn't share my conviction ... and your example shows why I am right. Indeed always when I found that page I felt like Alice just having falling down the rabbit hole. 

I think my rule allows those ad pages after the index ... certainly this was Knuth's idea.

I have written before about the incompatibility of revtex with diagxy, my 
diagram macros.  Actually, revtex will be incompatible with any package 
that uses dimensions based on em or ex.  However, I have discovered that 
placing \normalfont before the package will cure the problem, e.g.:

\documentclass[aps]{revtex4}
\normalsize
\input diagxy
.................

When I wrote to the revtex maintainers, I got an unhelpful reply, so I 
thought it worth posting what I discovered.

It should be easier to just declare:

\normalsize\normalfont

before doing settings with "em".  Untested, but hope springs eternal.

Surely "Appendix L".... Maybe "Appendix K" tells about the kpathsea file
search database extension.

My school offers no official support for their very specific formating. 
Is there anywhere I can find help when I need it for formatting support

Hi Kyle,

yes go with LaTeX you will not regret it. It makes writing dissertations
much more fun.
Plus after that you have one more skill for your CV.

Concerning the style. I guess schools which does not supply style files,
could not be very strict on there style. Just how could they request you
to use a style without any rules ?!

More important is the way of work between you and your supervisor. If he
is a MS Word fanboy, he might ask (force) you to supply him a MS Word
file for his corrections ("because I can do this fanncy annotations with
it").

Also administration could create problems if they request simply silly
and wrong formats. If thats happen, you have proverbial rape the
TeX-system to force it to do things wrong.

Thus, I guess to get the format right might be easy. But make sure you
will not meet a bonehead during your proof-reading or submission.

Best regards

Torsten

Kyle,

Go for it. Once you get the formatting demons under control it's not
too bad. I made a document class years ago for my school and have been
maintaining it. The way I did the formatting was with the geometry
package and setspace and ragged2e to do the RaggedRight margins my
school wanted. Since I wanted to make the process automated for future
generations I built it into a document class.
You may want to consider using hyperref at least for the revision
process. http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html

Best and Good Luck,

-nate iverson

http://www-math.bgsu.edu/~inathan/bgsu_latex_class.html

Here are some snippets of the formatting work done in bgsu.cls

\usepackage{ragged2e} % to allow ragged right margins
\RaggedRight %In main document

% 1 inch margins pagenumbers only in 3/4 inch, footnotes included as
part of text
\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{margin=1.0in, nofoot, headsep=6pt}

\usepackage{setspace} % For double spacing
\doublespacing % In main document

A shame that this hasn't been answered before.

\hyp or that macro it calls according to the hyphenat documentation might be redefined (about as follows) or you use some \dhyp or so instead of \hyp with

    \newcommand{\dhyp}{\discretionary{-}{-}{-}}

(not tested, sorry; if it works, why use hyphenat?) cf. TeXbook on \discretionary.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=63k7hoxk7i-4gtQtUuQeUVj62TRL884JQwiLe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I have an interdisciplinary question regarding the use of LateX for webpages
and the production of .pdf documents.  Suppose I wish to create a bunch of
faculty resource pages on my website.  I want them easily accessible for
faculty desiring a quick answer to something as well as comprehensively
available in a .pdf document someone could download to read and study on a
more macro basis which would encompass many of the web pages of material.
 Is there any way to do this and only maintain the material in one place so
one could browse website pages or hit a button and download a .pdf file?  I
know how to do the latter in LaTeX but am unfamiliar with using LaTeX to
generate web pages.  If one can do this, is it better to compile the .pdf
documents every time the page material is updated or is there a way to have
the webpage be smart enough to compile the material into a .pdf document
whenever someone wishes to download?  Thanks for any thing anyone could
recommend.  If anyone has good resources for creating web pages with LaTeX
(assuming that is not nonsensical), that would also be appreciated.

Sincerely,

Tom

Hi Tom,

There are a lot of answers to your question, as there are different 
applications trying to get the job done in a LaTeX to webpage 
conversion. Some examples:

1. The Digital Library of Mathematical Functions 
(http://dlmf.nist.gov/), a complete revision of Abramowitz and Stegun?s 
Handbook of Mathematical Functions, is written entirely in LaTeX and 
converted to XHTML+MathML via LaTeXML (http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/).

2. Zentralblatt Math (http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/) offers 
partial support for "webified" formulas via MathML, produced via Tralics 
(http://www-sop.inria.fr/miaou/tralics/)

3. Many authors rely on the more classical, yet more complete in support 
tools, namely latex2html (http://www.latex2html.org/) and tex4ht 
(http://tug.org/applications/tex4ht/).

So, what you choose for converting your LaTeX document to a webpage 
depends on what your particular needs are. Now, I am personally slightly 
biased towards LaTeXML, so I won't try to push my own preferences, but I 
would definitely recommend it ;-)

If I understand correctly your second question, you are asking if you 
can require a compile-to-pdf invocation whenever someone downloads a 
file? Why not keep a static PDF and rerun LaTeX and your choice of a 
LaTeX-to-Web software when you update the file? You can write a simple 
Makefile that does that for you in principle.

Cheers,
Deyan

Hi Tom,

It's quite possible, though there may be more modern
solutions now. I got good results using Latex2HTML
for these DSP composition tutorials 

http://obiwannabe.co.uk/html/music/musictuts.html

A script employing unix 'make' and a bit of
perl or python will help you get the bevahiour you describe;
so that any update is reflected in recompiling
and linking in a fresh pdf as well as uploading the
new web content, whenever you make a change.

I haven't made many such documents recently, what
I discovered on the last journey was that, to some degree,
you still need to think in both HTML and LaTeX/pdf because
not everything can be laid out to suit both styles. 
Example might be code pretty printing, or a package
for the markup of algorithms like Knuth, or having
images look good in both documents.

In the end something that produces basic, functional
HTML and a good pdf from LaTeX can be made pretty using
a css stylesheet. 

The more you get into the separation of content and style
philosophy the more you want to make little macros
and filters for your own documentation needs .

Getting clever, once you start having fun, you can
cross ref web content from the pdf using hyperef
package.

I am surprised to see that tex2page? is rarely mentioned when it comes
to converters. I heard about this tool 8 years ago but only started
using it a few days ago. It understands plain TeX and LaTeX out of box
along with a few traditional packages people use with LaTeX. Everything
else can be programmed in a file jobname.t2p of your project. You can
also program TeX in either scheme or lisp. Check out the short manual on
its web page. Quite a few MIT on-line textbooks are generated by
tex2page.

Cheers
Leo.

Subject: [texhax] No room for new \count
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1008211942060.21088@coral.301south.net>

I recently ran into the error "No room for new \count".  I understand that 
TeX only has room for 256 counters, but I don't think I'm using this many. 
I think, instead, that I have some kind of error in my coding, which has 
gotten considerably more complicated in the last few weeks.

I'm using arrayjobx, with many arrays (probably around 20), and a number 
of fancy tricks to index into them.  And I'm using multido, with 2 and 
sometimes 3 levels of nesting.  Plus a couple of custom styles which use 
counters.  But I only declare \newcount 8 times, and they're all at the 
base level in style files (never in macros). So I can't imagine how I 
could be running out of counters.

Any suggestions as to how I can try to troubleshoot?  What commands other 
than \newcount might cause a counter to be allocated?

I can try to produce a minimal example, but as I said, the code I'm 
working with has gotten quite complex.

Thanks in advance,
brandon

Thanks!  \usepackage{etex} as the 2nd line of my document solved the 
problem.  or, rather, "hid" the problem.

I've attached some sample output.  Previously, I couldn't do more than 6 
bars without running out of counters.  But that's bad- because I want to 
be reusing the same counters, not creating new ones. The code that 
generates the error is basically a single function call, so the line 
number doesn't help much. I'll look at \errorcontextlines and see what 
that tells me.

I guess I'll spend some more quality time with the TeXbook..  But for now, 
the problem is in hiding once again.

I lied.  I was using \newcount inside a macro.  I solved the problem with 
the following trick:

\let\oldnewcount\newcount
\def\newcount{\typeout{new count!}\oldnewcount}

and then using other \typeouts to triangulate the location of all the 
copious counters.  It was in a function I had written awhile ago before I 
knew better, in a style file I had forgot I was using.

Even more simple would have been a look into the .log file.
Each \newcount writes a line, e.g. \newcount\foobar generates:
  \foobar=\count79

Can you figure out which line of code is causing the error?  (it
should show up after "l." in the error message).  If you want to see
more details of how TeX got there, you can try setting
\errorcontextlines=100 to get more context.

Without knowing anything else, though, my guess would be that you're
including a bunch of other packages that all have their own counters,
and together you're going over the limit.  \newcount is declared
\outer by default, so there shouldn't be any way of looping over it.

Also, eTeX provides many more count registers, though I don't know the
details of how to use it (or if that's on by default).

Cheers,
steve

Hi. I'm not sure if this is where I can ask my question.

I've installed TexLive 2009 on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 server. It built successfully using configure, make and make install. However, when a client runs a Latex program, it gives the following:

 

~/testLatex:latex utf8test.tex

This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.4.5)

(./utf8test.tex

LaTeX2e <2001/06/01>

Babel <v3.7h> and hyphenation patterns for american, french, german, ngerman, n

ohyphenation, loaded.

(/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/article.cls

Document Class: article 2001/04/21 v1.4e Standard LaTeX document class

(/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/size11.clo))

(/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/inputenc.sty

 

! LaTeX Error: File `utf8.def' not found.

 

I believe the make check also gave this utf8.def error. I have no idea what to do with this as I'm a sys admin and don't know anything about this product. I install TexLive under /usr/local/. There is a utf8.def file under /usr/local/2009/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/utf8.def. Can you please tell me what's wrong or how we can fix this?

 

Thank you.

Yes, but the one in the path is the older one.

PATH.

You can't mix encodings! You use ---want it or not--- either one or the other. Which encoding are you using in the editor you use to typeset your text? That's what matters and that's what you have to tell LaTeX to use.

For example, if your editor is using UTF8 and you type

	? ? ?

and then convert that to Latin 1 you get

	?? ?? ??

and viceversa, if your editor is using Latin 1 and you type

	F?r meinen Vater           (TikZ manual)

and then convert that to UTF8, you get

	F?r meinen Vater


Best,

Axel

I see that in the TeXLive mailing list Norbert Preining had already dealt with the path problem in his reply, but don't forget that you can't mix encodings...

Well, as a matter of fact, yes, you can ---you can type one chapter of a book in one encoding and another chapter in a different encoding, and \include or \input them in one master document, but you wont like the result...

Remember ---the important thing is which encoding is being used in the editor ---that's the one you should tell LaTeX to load.

Harry Moses,

I cannot reproduce the TeXShop problem you report: "file name 
is Untitled at the top of the DVI page". Could you send a short example
to me at koch at math.uoregon.edu? I assume the "DVI page" in your
message means the Preview page when typesetting in "TeX and DVI" mode. 
A screen snapshot of the problem would also be useful.

Subject: [texhax] metapost/metafun or mptopdf problem?
Message-ID: <1282909588.13191.12.camel@rrvhassel-desktop>

Hello Tex-Users,


I use beside Latex also ConTeXt and that with texlive-2007.
I installed texlive-2009 and got problems with the metapost 
or metafun files. I don't see something of it in the end result.
With texlive-2007, I got my directory full with numbered 
mpgraph-files, but with texlive-2009 nothing. 
While the program compiles with texexec, you see that something 
is made of a mpgraph-file, but only with the number .1 and not 
with .4000 and that kind of numbers. Most of the time I got 
200 or 300 files and at this moment with texlive-2009 nothing.
So something is made, that is my idea, but directly deleted or 
something else happens with these files, I have no idea.
How to solve this problem? How do I get my "decorations" in my 
text, so the .pdf files, back?


greetings,


Rene' van Hassel

Hello Uwe,

Many thanks for the answer. (Sorry for the holiday delay in answering...)

This \dhyp indeed produces intended additional dash, but it disables
hyphenation of compound words. I actually need

straw-chop-
per

straw-
-chopper

and hyphenat's \BreakableHyphen serves this purpose. So, some
experimenting shows that this code gives good results in all cases:

------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyphenat}
\newcommand{\dhyp}{\discretionary{-}{}{}%
  \ifmmode-\else\BreakableHyphen\fi}
\begin{document}
\noindent\fbox{%
\begin{minipage}{2cm}%
and electroencephalography\\
straw\dhyp{}chopper\\
\hspace*{1.1cm}straw\dhyp{}chopper
\end{minipage}%
}
\end{document}
------------------------------------------------------

Not very elegant, though.

Thanks,
Alex

I should be able to find a more elegant solution, once I studied these things -- but must do other things right now.

Not German but Spanish.  Run

  texdoc babel   (TeX Live)
  mthelp babel   (MikTeX)

and look for "~ on page 157.

Subject: [texhax] When to modify \topmargin and \textheight?
Message-ID: <op.vh85avpltpjj8f@lpr>

Hello,

I have problem - let's have the following code:


\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{article}

\usepackage[cp1250]{inputenc}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{blindtext}

\begin{document}

   \Blindtext[8]

   \newpage
   \addtolength{\textheight}{1.in}
   \addtolength{\topmargin}{-.5in}

   \Blindtext[8]

\end{document}


This code produces pdf of four pages (pdflatex, TL2009, WinXP):

- Page 1, 2 - pages use standard (non-modified) page layout.

- Page 3 - the page content is shifted up as the \topmargin has been modified. The text height keeps the original value (?) of \textheight, like \textheight were not modified.

- Page 4 is modified by my needs, i.e. the "working" area of the page is stretched by 1 in and the top margin is shortened by 0.5 in - that's what I'm trying to achieve.

So:

- Why page #3 is not changed like #4, although the change of dimensions is declared BEFORE page 3?

- How to provide that the change of dimensions is done "in time" - it means for the page #3 for this case?

Thank you in advance.

Lukas

At \begin{document} LaTeX initializes other length registers
with the value of \textheight, thus these length registers need
to be corrected, too.

  \addtolength{\textheight}{1in}
  \addtolength{\vsize}{1in}
  \makeatletter
  \addtolength{\@colht}{1in}
  \addtolength{\@colroom}{1in}
  \makeatother
  \addtolength{\topmargin}{-.5in}

Other possiblity is using \newgeometry from package `geometry'.

Yours sincerely

Indeed I learnt these things with german.sty (especially \allowhyphens) and the TeXbook.
