Subject: [texhax] Inserting space after each char in a string
Message-ID: <AANLkTinTM2CcqwKjS3mJ-HzX5qAUYEN9qUnzbwO=nyef@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I need a command which allows me to insert a certain space after each
character of the string given as argument, but don't know how to accomplish.

I am looking for something like this

\textspace{\quad}{some long word} which produces then

s\quad o\quad m\quad e\quad etc..

Any ideas?


Thanks in advance,

Uwe

There is a macro \@tfor in the LaTeX kernel.  It's described in
source/latex/base/ltcntrl.dtx .  Don't know whether it works with
UTF-8 properly.

But \@tfor isn't expandable, uses \def. Therefore I spent an hour with this:

If you look on p.157 of the paper:
http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/24/7/24-07.pdf
you will see a picture that was created using, I believe, an eps 
inclusion.  The result is that, unlike nearly all papers in the journal, 
it is posted only in pdf format (the rest are in dvi, ps, and pdf).  There 
are a number of other diagrams that look complicated but all of them are 
possible using xy-pic.

Sorry for not having signed (below), too impatient. 

I also haven't dealt with interword spaces as in the example, 
but the example doesn't give any hint what do do at spaces. 

 (i) The macros work reasonably when you enclose spaces in braces.
(ii) The main macro could be modified so it reads blank spaces as 
     "other"; then they are dealt with just like characters.

And I haven't reasoned about UTF-8 that Reinhard mentioned. 
The macros should work when you put non-ASCII characters 
in braces (only then?)

Cheers, 

    Uwe.?

xy-pic is old-fashioned and its output is poor in comparison to the output
that you get from tikz or pstricks which give you vector graphics. You can
do all of these entirely in LaTeX using pstricks or tikz.

Depends on what you are doing with xypic and which options it is loaded 
with.

I thought I had made it clear that what I was interested in was being able 
to compile it into a dvi file.  I don't think either tikz or pstricks does 
that.

I am mystified by the claim that xy-pic produces poor output.  I use it 
extensively (using my own front end diagxy) and it produces superb output.

Do users think that dvi is becoming obsolete?  Do you think that in, say 
30 years (the length of time that dvi has been around), there will be pdf 
readers for whatever computers are around by then.  Will there be dvi 
readers?

Methink that pstricks cannot do this but tikz does. I sent a complete
source, so I attaching dvi

Hope this helps to persuade you in the power of pgf :-)

I did not say xy-pic output is poor but I said that its output in comparison
to tikz output or pstricks output is poor. Xy-pic used to use fonts for many
diagrams until xy-pdf was introduced.

Most windows users will not know anything about either PostScript or DVI.

They know about PDF so that is what they use.

There are HUGE numbers of documents being stored in PDF format now,
including TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt documents, as well as those from other sources.
 It's probably *the* pre-eminent digital archiving format.

Therefore, in 30 years, there will absolutely be some accomodation for PDF.
 It may be converters as opposed to readers, but there will be some way to
access these documents.

There may still be a small but dedicated following for DVI, still
maintaining some support software, but it will certainly be a fringe effort.

I don't know. However let us look what happened with many paper
journals and books in mathematics. They were digitalized either
legally or illegally to/or pdf or djvu formats.

If in 30 years the humanity will be around and pdf format becomes
obsolete and no pdf readers will be around, there will be
pdf-to-new_format converters and all journals and books will be
converted (even if tex sources will be lost): digitalization was much
more difficult and time consuming process

Produce dvi file? I wrote "Methink" but I am not sure.

Are there any macros, packages or styles that will let me copyfit text in
LaTeX?  I'm using 'copyfit' in the sense of dynamically varying line
spacing, font size and character spacing to force some given amount of text
to fit into some given sized area.

Any pointers would be appreciated.

Thanks!

I tried asking this on the XeTeX list a couple of days ago, but have gotten
no responses.  Maybe someone here can help me.

I gather I can get either PDF or XDV output from XeTeX.  If I want
PostScript, are there xdvps drivers, analogous to Rokicki's dvips?

Assuming there is, are there particular \specials that will cause the xdvps
driver to create PostScript forms and form references for some of the
document elements?

Thanks very much,

I think, the code on 
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/2231/fitting-and-centering-text-both-in-a-constrained-area
should do what you want.

Then you can go from PDF using pdftops (from xpdf), for example.

I don't think thus.

What are PostScript forms?
There are two different "form" concepts in PDF:
* formulars/widgets
* xform objects

Since the DVI format doesn't support any graphic primitives except
black rectangles (\rule), both, pstricks and pgf/tikz need a post
processor.

The only exception is PDF output.  tikz/pgf does all the arithmetic in
TeX and therefore can insert graphic primitives directly into the PDF
file (as \pdfliteral).  pstricks does arithmetic in PostScript and
always needs a post processor.

If you've seen fancy things in xdvi, it's because xdvi understands a
tiny subset of PostScript commands, maybe just enough to support
LaTeX's color package.  It uses ghostscript in order to render bitmap
images.

  Reinhard

A PostScript form is an object containing arbitrary graphics or text.
You can create it once and use it multiple times using the execform
operator.  See section 4.7 in the PS reference.

To answer Peter's question, there are no dedicated \specials for
forms.  But you can pass arbitrary PS code to \specials anyway.

  Reinhard

Here is my reaction to the various replies I have received.  First, as 
long as TeX is TeX it will be required to produce dvi files.  As for pdf, 
I have no doubt that when it is no longer supported, there will be 
converters.  But the journal I help edit has several hundred papers in pdf 
format (most also in dvi and ps).  Who will convert them.  It would be a 
huge job and we run on zero budget.  To see what can happen, what would 
you do with a Word file from, say, 1990?  Each version of Word can handle 
files from the previous version or two, but no further.  So unless that 
file was continually updated from version to version, it is effectively 
dead.  I don't expect this to happen with pdf, but it illustrates the 
problems.

I have one further problem with pdf.  I am accustomed to compiling a file, 
previewing it, making changes and then iterate.  I cannot do that with the 
Adobe reader.  I cannot write a new pdf file while the old one is loaded. 
So exit the file from the reader, then compile the new version, load 
the new file, and then find your place again.  I find this intolerable. 
Someone once suggested a different pdf reader and I tried it and found it 
unsatisfactory in other ways (I no longer recall why).  I'll stick to dvi, 
thank you.

Just as a note here, I experienced a similar hassle using Adobe Reader.
Switching to Ubuntu and the default pdf reader on that OS, Evince, greatly
enhanced my productivity with LaTeX as it auto-refreshes when any changes
are made to the file you are viewing. I cannot overstate how much better
this is and how frustrated I become when I am forced to work with Adobe's
reader.

Just another option for you.

The problem is not with pdf; it's with the viewer, of course.

True, but it can be done with a three-key sequence: <CTRL>W + <ALT>F + 1.
But I take your point nonetheless. It's an unnecessary pain.

Maybe xpdf? It has a refresh feature.

No, there isn't.

If one wants a .ps file from a xetex document open the .pdf and print to a .ps file from Adobe Reader.

Thanks, Uwe, Reinhard, and Ulrike, for your answers. I'm just back from
hospital after an accident, that's why I didn't react earlier.

Uwe, you asked about what created the problem. Background: for some fantasy
roleplaying events I want to typeset a lot of (german) text in futhark, an
old runic aphabet. The only fonts I found up to now only contain the pure
runic alphabet, no punctuation marks, and even for some letters there's no
'translation'. Knowing the fonts' purpose, I wouldn't expect otherwise. So
now I am looking for an easy way to expand those futhark fonts for my
needs.

My first solution was a perl script that adds the necessary font change
commands. It works, but is far from elegant. In the next days, I will have
a look at fontforge and at virtual fonts. Thanks for those suggestions.

	Susan

Hear Hear!!!

I think I make about 50 passes through DVI for each article I prepare 
for the journals I set.  Many of them are at the last stage---page 
balancing---which often depends on adjustments as much as five pages 
earlier than the bad page break I am correcting.  
\stretchnextspread{<skip amount>} or \shrinknextspread{skip} or even 
\stretch(shrink)doublespread{} can correct problems many pages ahead, 
but none of these is likely to work on the first attempt.  (I have not 
even mentioned \looseness, which someone condemned about a year ago as 
useless. I could not live without it.) Of course, if there is no need 
for balanced spreads, or verso-recto baseline alignment, none of these 
refinements is needed, and these many passes through DVI can be avoided, 
but no press I work with would accept feathering or ragged bottom 
spreads unless I could show that there was ABSOLUTELY no alternative.  
So far, that (ragged bottom---NO feathering) has happened only once in 
twenty years of journal setting.

Michael,

If you think it is a huge job, I think you are running the wrong OS:

for i in *.pdf
do
    convert-pdf-to-new-whizzbang-format $i
done

As the Staples ads say, "That was easy".  :-)

There is a bit of a difference between a file format whose owners want
to force people to upgrade their software regularly (to keep the input
stream going) and PDF.  Not that I'm saying Adobe couldn't do
inconvenient things, but I don't think the analogy is sound.

The problem is not with Adobe reader, I'm guessing more likely the
problem is that you are using a brain-damaged OS.

As others have pointed out, xpdf and evince can refresh the PDF file,
and if you look at pdfopen on texlive (at least for Linux) you will
see that PDF files can be reloaded easily enough.  (For example, I
have an emacs macro which re-loads the new PDF version when I re-TeX a
file I am working on.)


Having said that, I do much of my work using dvi, because I find xdvi
is (normally) more convenient for the change/re-TeX/reload cycle than
is pdf+acroread.  If dvi goes away, I guess you and I (and many
others) are either going to have to hold on to the last version of TeX
that supports it or we will have to move on.

Cheers.
				Jim

Pierre, you are one of the Great Men of TeX, and I treat everything
you say as second only to Don.  But I can see nothing in the above
that is predicated on DVI.  Why would PDF not suffice for this most-
important-but-routine task that you undertake ?

Even easier in a sane operating system :

No need even for a "done" :-)

Thank for clarification.

I checked with xdvi (on MacOSX 10.6.5) - it is heavily bitmapped even
with -postscript command and no grayscale (only black) but converting
to ps restores nice look. So all conditions were satisfied: it was
done in LaTeX, standalone dvi file produced and this file could be
seen nicely.

That's too bad.  Converting from PDF seems way too slow for a production
environment.  Perhaps the source from some other xdvi driver can be adapted
to produce PostScript.

S/W butch conversion.  Not the hassle of digitalizing everything from
the date when the journal was first printed, written by the goose pen,
carved on the stone - and this was done

Argh, and there are journals which require articles to be submitted in
MSW format. Well, it is their problem/punishment.

This is very different topic: production vs reading the "stable" version.

The first answer might have been the question if you have checked the following packages 
(http://ctan.org/pkg/...)

    letterspacing (for Plain TeX) | nccstretch | soul | soulutf8 | textfit | tracking

Since we're playing golf:

But I don't think the *real* problem is executing the batch.

You said "sane", and yet you have "C:\".
Is this perhaps some local definition of the word "sane"?  :-)

Actually, a reasonable convert-pdf-to-new-whizzbang-format program
would take multiple file arguments, so you would really probably just
say
	convert-pdf-to-new-whizzbang-format *.pdf

It still seems easy.

Perhaps Micheal is just running some just-wrong interface, where to do
something with a file you have to open a file browser window, navigate
to the correct directory (*cough* folder), search for the file you are
looking for, click on it, click on an "Open" button, answer three "are
you really sure" dialogs, and then start the conversion process.  Come
to think of it, that would be a huge job (to say nothing of tedious).

Cheers.

we recommend using SumatraPDF on Windows to get around the locking and 
non-reload in AR.

Also the new editors and recent pdfLaTeX has synctex features such that 
one can bind pdf and editor together in the same manner as one can with 
dvi and certain editor.

The TeXWorks editor comes with its own PDF viewer and synctex enabled 
which our Windows users love very much (SumatraPDF can also be 
configured to use synctex, there are webpages describing how to 
integrate this into say TeXnicCenter).

On linux I still use Emacs, source specials and xdvi, mainly because 
synctex support in PDF viewers on Linux are still rare. But the newer 
versions of evince should be able to do this.

You should give texworks a try, it does not have many bells and whistles 
but the forward and backwards search (i.e. jumping from pdf to source 
and source to pdf) is a killer feature.

I'd turn it around. Processing PostScript code is way too slow for a production environment.

Surely what you need to do can be accomplished w/ a .pdf?

If I wanted to do penance for my mortal sins, I would prefer

There are shops whose workflows are highly optimized around PostScript.
 Pure PDF RIPs, and especially PDF/VT (the variable-transactional version of
PDF) are relatively new and not widely used.  Probably most RIPs in the
world convert PDF to PostScript before rasterizing.

Did you try microtype (or the letterspace package, included in the

I have always suspected that ... it's a reason to use LaTeX and other
text (ascii) based tools - aside from the switch to unicode they
should last a really long time.  But that's not why I started this

Nope.  I've written to them inumerable times about it for some years
and they ignored the suggestion.  It's a trivial bit of code!

I recently found skim:

http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/

It can be set to automatically reload.  It is my basic viewer now for
LaTeX output.  It is for Mac OS X though.

Apparently that works on Mac OS X too but I haven't tried yet.

It already is (mostly) and has been since the start of this millenium.
I say mostly because I know of _one_ application of dvi where pdf is
simply not the right tool[1].

Yes. PDF is an open international standard; so is PDF/A, which was
defined so that it can be read for all future.

Probably (DVI is a well defined open format), but you may have to
program it yourself.

No, you should know Phil better.  If he uses the word "sane", he has
VMS in mind.  But he still believes that VMS and Windows is one and
the same thing.

That's not so far-fetched, given that David Cutler was a (the?) leading
architect of both VMS and NT.

I know.  But it doesn't mean that NT and VMS are identical.  Windows
is a mixture of VMS, MS-DOG, Unix, maybe some others, and own
extensions.  I can't imagine that VMS, or any other OS, was/is such a
mess.

Hi together,

I guess the microtype package does exactly what I need. Together with Uwe's
solution I guess I can deal with all related tasks.

?

What do you want to achieve?  If you want to process the compiled
documents in 30 years, your decision is wrong.

You started a new thread now with the subject line "dvi vs pdf", but
instead of discussing the differences between DVI and PDF file formats
and capabilities, the discussion is about deficiencies of the Windows
file system and the like.

The short answer is: A DVI file is nothing worth at all for long-term
archiving.

It only contains information about glyph placements and the names of
fonts being used.  Everything else is supported by \specials, which
allow you to pass arbitrary stuff to post processors.  This is highly
device-dependent.  Don't expect that if your DVI file containing
\specials for dvips works with anything but dvips.

Instead of archiving .dvi files it's better to archive the .tex
sources.  Then you can adapt the \specials at least, if necessary.
In other words: If you insist on DVI, you have to archive all the
required resources (fonts, graphics, post processors,...) too.

You said that you can't process old M$ Word files.  One reason is that
older versions of M$ Word didn't include the fonts.  But DVI is even
worse:  While newer versions of Word insert the fonts, your DVI files
expect that you have the same fonts installed on your system in 30
years which you used when you created the files.

PDF is self-contained, hence it's sufficient to archive a single file.
The PDF file format is designed with long-term archiving in mind.

I'm wondering why the useless discussion about Adobe Reader on Windows
pops up again and again.  PDF files can be large, thus AR doesn't load
the whole file into memory but only the parts which are actually
needed.  The nasty file locking problem is a deficiency of Windows and
exists only there.  Load a huge file into one of the PDF viewers which
try to circumvent this problem and see how your system reacts when it
runs out of swap space.

I don't know why people are moaning all the time.  If Windows is too
inconvenient, simply use something else.  Sticking to DVI only because
of this inconvenience is by far the worst thing one can do.

And, Lars, it doesn't matter whether a Windows user knows what a PDF
file is if the question is whether PDF will be supported in 30 years.
I'm wondering if there are any Windows users in 30 years at all.  Just
for the record, a few years ago people still assumed that Microsoft
will support MS-DOG forever.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I've found several ways of producing pdf output from Latex, and having
the pdf reader refresh the document after it was typeset.  Of course,
there is a different way for each operating system.

On linux, I've become very fond of Okular, KDE's pdf viewer.  If you
enable the option "Reload document on file change", then Okular
reloads the document when the .pdf changes.  It works well with the
edit, compile, view workflow that you described earlier.

Xpdf is also reload-friendly.  (You may have to press `r' to cause the
reload.  I can't remember for sure right now).

On Mac OS, I'd configure TexShop to use an external
editor. (Preferences > Document > Configure for external editor).
 From a command line, "open myfile.tex".  TexShop runs pdflatex and
renders the pdf.  Edit myfile.tex in your favorite editor, then switch
back to TexShop and press Cmd-T to typeset and view the results.

Someone mentioned Skim -- I believe that Skim has a "check for file
changes option".

I used MikTeX once (literally, once :) and it seems to have an
integrated pdf viewer that reloads the document each time it's
typeset.

Wikipedia lists many pdf readers

   https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/PDF_reader

I'm sure you can find one that fits your needs better than Adobe
reader.

But of course, if dvi works well for you, then why mess with a good
thing? :)

Steve

Let look at current decision made by arXiv: they always want source
and default postprocessing used to be ps and now pdf.

The other thing: AFAIK dvi format does not evolve, pdf does. And
expands at the expense of ps and djvu. I do not remember the format it
won the first battle with

dvi is an intermediary format. It doesn't have contents. It can only
be (pre)viewed when a TeX-System is present, and this preview is
accurate only if all graphics are shipped together with the dvi, if
all fonts are present and if the previewer can handle all the

background it use dvips to generate a ps and view this with
ghostscript.)

The source of your document is neither dvi nor pdf nor ps: it is the
TeX-file. I don't care what happens to the end formats pdf or ps as
long as I'm able to process the source files to whatever format will
appear.

Well I prefer pdf even in the production phase because
- I can have bookmarks
- Copy and searching in the pdf is possible
- Zooming is faster
- it saves time: as I have to send pdf's I must check the pdf's
regularly anyway as the fact that it looks good in YAP doesn't mean
that the pdf is ok.

Not quite : he does believe that the demise of VMS is one of the
greatest tragedies that the computer world has ever experienced,
and he genuinely cannot understand how anyone could have chosen
Unix when VMS was still in existence, but he is not daft enough
to think that VMS and Windows are one and the same -- just that,
for a normal human being seeking an operating system to run on
the desktop platform, the only sane choice is currently Windows XP.

Fair enough, but if one is going to limit oneself to last century's technology then one should not be surprised that one is bound to the limitations of last century's font and encoding limitations &c. w/o some work-arounds I'd be loathe to use in a production environment.

See my TUG2003 paper on using Zapfino for one such work-around.

There used to be a British guy who advocated a ``tiny typesetter'' using raw postscript code --- if you need PostScript (which I don't recall being in your original requirements) perhaps that would work better?

Ah, here we are:

Well, it does get extended, hence XeTeX's .xdv format and xdvipdfmx

That said, the OP does have a point --- it is faster to write out .dvi (or some extended variant) and then generate a viewable version of each page on an as-needed basis --- but on the gripping hand, as fast as computers are these days, the ability of a user to perceive this speed differential has diminished to the point of imperceptibility.

Unfortunately, older technology does not instantly disappear the minute
something better is invented.  In delivering software solutions, it's often
necessary to work with what is deployed, as most companies tend to have
finite budgets.

Do you mean "There is no end: Omega and Zapfino", TUGboat 24(2)?  Looks

Interesting.  There's also Graham Freeman's Quikscript.

But this is beside the point.  There are commercial workflows today that
depend on PostScript as the page description language, so that's the world I
must work in.

Which should be spent wisely. I know a RIP is a big investment (we recently upgraded ours), but the Adobe PDF Print Engine is an excellent bit of software, and well worth it.

Yep. I don't think it's of anything other than historical interest now though.

If that's the case, I'd look at wrapping up all of the complex Unicode stuff in .eps files and pulling those in w/ some sort of PostScript-oriented workflow.

Probably one could re-work xdvipdfmx so as to emit PostScript code instead (as you are aware, PDF is in many ways a subset of PostScript), but I suspect one would find a lot of edge cases which would mung up a lot of paper before one achieved tool one could rely on.

The vast majority of what we're doing today needs only ISO 8659-1, so there
really is no complex Unicode stuff, though we'd certainly like to keep that
option open for the future.

Well, there are ways to validate PostScript without actually munging up
paper.

In fairness, I'm also going to explore the PDF->PS route to see what kind of
performance I can get.  I've used the pdf2ps tool that's included in XPDF in
the past, and it was reasonably fast.

I'm probably baying at the moon, or clutching at straws, or
whatever, but given the origins of PDF I wonder if there
might not be some way of putting a PostsScript wrapper
around a PDF such that the resulting document is fully
PostScript compliant and processable by a PostScript RIP ?

Or maybe not :

Hello Susan,

Sorry to hear about that! Hope you're much better now.

I don't know if the following snippet (for Chinese) at
http://bbs.ctex.org/viewthread.php?tid=56076 would serve your purpose:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\font\1="AR PL SungtiL GB"
\font\2="SimHei"

\1
??%
\newcount\aaa
\aaa=`?%
\iffontchar\1\aaa  \char\aaa \else {\2\char\aaa}\fi
\end{document}


Basically the example first uses AR PL SungtiL GB as the font. It then tests
if the character ? is defined in the font; if it is, the same font is used;
otherwise switch to SimHei. You could define a new command from this
snippet, depending on your needs.

Can I be so bold as to suggest you visit http://blogs.adobe.com/insidepdf 
written by Jim King, Adobe's PDF architect. For you seem to have a 
fundamental misunderstanding of what PDF is about. For instance, one 
nugget from http://blogs.adobe.com/insidepdf/2007/11 is that PDF was 
specifcally designed to be a communications format and *not* a page 
description format like PostScript. As such, PDF is basically a container 
format and so the natural way around is for a PDF to include its
own reference PostScript representation, should it need to.
Doing things the other way around is just plain silly.

PDF was originally based on the Adobe Illustrator 88 format, which was
essentially a set of conventions and prolog procedures for PostScript.
 However, PDF has introduced other structural components that don't
correspond to PostScript, such as the index at the back of the file.

pdf2ps comes from ghostscript, pdftops from xpdf. I would try pdftops
first (in my experience the result is more `bitmapped' than
necessary with the pswrite device of ghostscript).

Talking of evolution, it is worth noting that PDF has already reached the 
point where one could add a dvi renderer to a PDF, courtesy of the 
built-in FlashPlayer engine. And as you brought up arXiv, you might care 
to read Ginsparg's contribution in "The Fourth Paradigm" see:
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/fourthparadigm/ in which 
he writes "PDF will not provide a convenient transport format" when 
talking of the next generation of "scholarly communication".

Interestingly, PDF has already evolved to the point where Ginsparg's 
assertion can be refuted with concrete PDF documents. Because the same 
built-in FlashPlayer can be used to construct custom XML renderers for the 
data-intensive applications discussed in The Fourth Paradigm. Although
it does have to be noted that when pushed in that direction PDF is sadly 
no longer portable; witness the November 30th release of Linux AR9.4.1 
where the JS/SWF communication bridge is crippled.

There's a nice piece at:

http://blogs.adobe.com/insidepdf/2007/10/pdf_by_design.html

which provides some of the thinking which led to PDF.

The output of pdf2ps is supposed to be sent directly to the
typesetter.  Glyphs are converted to lines and curves.  Hence you have
to specify the resolution of the output device.  The default is 720dpi. 

pdftops produces PS with hinted fonts which can be used at arbitrary
resolutions.

I often look to your answers for advice, but my question about this 
piece of advice is:

                       Have you ever tried to read the stuff that 
results from conversion from PDF to PS?

As for editing it (which is sometimes unavoidable) it is pretty well 
impossible.

As a later message pointed out.  PDF is a document delivery system, with 
very little
concern for document creation, except in black-box mode.  I really do 
not think that
will change.  As for the permanence of PDF.  PDF/A is part of an 
attempt, (apparently
most actively supported in Europe) to forestall Adobe's tendency to make 
unannounced
and incompatible changes in PDF (think about the disappearance of 
small-caps and old-style
figures between Reader 6 and Reader 7, which leaves any earlier PDFs 
that includes those characters
unusable unless you do some really tricky editing inside the file) but 
the industry is already
into PDF/X-[1-5],  and perhaps beyond.

DVI is not an archive format, and I can't imagine anyone trying to use 
ot that way.  TeX source
is the archive format.

Whichever one is included with XPDF is the one I want.  Apologies if I mixed
up the names.

Ghostscript also provides the script ps2ps2 that uses
the device ps2write, the result is much more close to
the original PDF (it appends a PostScript header before
a file with PDF-1.2.

Message-ID: <201012040106.oB416FZU003946@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

- 2011 TUG election: the deadline to receive nominations is now
  May 1, 2011, rather than the Feb 1 deadline printed in
  TUGboat.  We made this change after we belatedly realized
  the 2011 conference happening so late in the year (see
  below) potentially implies an unnecessarily long "lame
  duck" period.

  For nomination forms and full info, see:
    http://tug.org/election/


- The TeX Collection 2010 DVD collection has been shipped from the
  manufacturer in Germany and should be out to members soon.
    http://tug.org/texcollection/


- TUGboat: The third and last issue for 2010 mailed recently, and is
  available online to members.
  
  The first issue for 2011 will be TUGboat's 100th issue.
  Even though it is only a decimal anniversary :), we would
  like to solicit special contributions for the occasion --
  articles about the history and evolution of TeX and the
  TeX community would be especially welcome.  Of course, all
  the usual topics are welcome too.  Deadline is March 31.
    http://tug.org/TUGboat/


- Conferences:
  TUG 2011 will be held in Cairo, Egypt, tentatively from
  November 14-17, and will include a planned excursion.
  Hossam Fahmy of Cairo University is the chief organizer.
  The web site will be updated when arrangements are finalized.
    http://tug.org/tug2011/
    
  Other upcoming conferences:
  EuroBachoTeX from April 29-May 3, 2011, in Bachotek, Poland;
  fifth ConTeXt user meeting Sept 19-24, 2011, in Porquerolles, France.
    http://tug.org/meetings.html


- If you need TeXnical books from Pearson (Addison-Wesley, et al.)
  this holiday season, please consider going through TUG
  to order.  We greatly appreciate all such.
    http://tug.org/books/


- The latest subjects in the Interview Corner are Frank Liang from the
  Stanford TeX project and Herbert Voss, maintainer of
  PStricks and many other packages, author of several TeX
  books, and the editor of DANTE's journal, Die TeXnische Komodie.
    http://tug.org/interviews/


- In memoriam: I am very sad to report that Mimi Burbank passed away
  at the end of November.  She was the mainstay of TUGboat
  production for many years, and spent the last few years in
  Uganda doing humanitarian work.  A full memorial notice
  will be in the next TUGboat.

Thanks, great idea really to try it, especially travelling!

However, what do you see as second and third entry 
in the primitives glossary chapter 37?

Great! Now: can you write down the equations 
describing the interaction of electrons with TeX 
that leads to this difference between the printed 
an the electronic version?

Curious:

Dear All,

When I run the following through LaTeX and dvipdf:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{html}

\begin{document}

\url{http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=ZXD&rls=org.gentoo:de-AT:unofficial&&sa=X&ei=tgr5TNTjJom7hAeDvrSnCQ&ved=0CBQQvgUoAA&q=package+options+hthtml&nfpr=1}

\end{document}

I get a clickable link in the PDF file, but the URL text sticks off
the right-hand edge of the page.  If, on the other hand, I use the
following, slightly different, LaTeX file:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[hyphens]{url}

\begin{document}

\url{http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=ZXD&rls=org.gentoo:de-AT:unofficial&&sa=X&ei=tgr5TNTjJom7hAeDvrSnCQ&ved=0CBQQvgUoAA&q=package+options+hthtml&nfpr=1}

\end{document}

the URL text is nicely hyphenated, but there's no clickable link.  Is
there some way I can get a clickable link with the hyphenated text,
please?

Dan

Howdy,

Is there a reason you're not using the hyperref package?

Good Luck,

Yes.  Well, that is to say, I have discovered a truly
remarkable proof which this message is too small to contain.

Assuming that "dvipdf" means dvipdfmx: Use hyperref with the driver
option dvipdfmx. If "dvipdf" involves dvips: dvips can't break
links. In this case you should use breakurl.

Please take a look at:

   http://www.amrita-cfd.org/tex-group/blind-pew.pdf

and you'll see that "Fermat's Gambit" no longer applies.
So please pass across your remarkable proof and I'll be 
more than happy to squeeze it into your original posting. :-)

Very nice, James : it is not often that a message gives
me so much amusement/pleasure !

(Unfortunately the proof I had in mind will not fit
in a finite space, but if you have access to any
aleph-null compressors that are AR9 compatible, I will
be happy to try to circulate it).

Yes. The proof will be squeezed in using fractal spaces which
I've squeezed into the periods in your message.
Get it: Blind Pew -> back spot -> periods. Enjoy!

The Mandelbrot viewer is fully functional under Windows:
Hit a to toggle anti-aliasing of the shading
Hit m to change the mapping of colours
Hit r to reset the view
Hit + to increase the number of colours
Hit - to decrease the number of colours
And the arrow keys can be used to pan around the set.

Unfortunately the key presses are broken under Linux,
but don't blame me, blame Adobe!

If you mean html.sty, it ships with latex2html.  As Herbert pointed
out, CTAN has a very old version of it at support/ltx2x/html.sty - but
that old version doesn't appear to define a \url command!

A right mouse-click should bring up a context menu that
will allow you to open the Mandelbrot viewer in a floating
window. You can then resize it manually to whatever  you want,
or you can put it into full screen mode. But be warned,
the larger the window the slower the set will be to render.

This opens the door to the short proofs with sentences like "easy
details are left to the reader" with expandable "details" in turn
containing "details for not so intelligent readers" and then "details
for dump readers". The short proof is written then by the prominent
member of Academia, and different levels of details are filled by

Reminds me of an apocryphal story concerning mathematicians :

"All mathematicians are liars."
"Why do you say that ?".
"Because all of them, without exception, have written,
  at least once in their lives, 'It therefore immediately
  follows that ...', whereas in reality it does no such thing !".

dvipdf is a script that ships with GNU Ghostscript.  It runs

dvips -R -Ppdf

then pipes the output through a Ghostscript filter to make a PDF file.

Brilliant.  That's done the trick nicely.  Thank you very much.

Huh.  I always thought that it was because it was a TeX system for a

Message-ID: <4CFA3291.5090207@gmx.de>

Dear all,

I have a simple question. I used to install TL via the net installer. 
Recently, I found out that there is a less time consuming alternative, 
namely the
iso image. Once downloaded it takes about 3 min. to install TL. 
Unfortunately, there is no iso image that contains the most recent updates.
Installing texlive2010.iso and updating for another 1-2 hours does not 
save time compared to the net installer.

Maybe, you could also provide an iso image that contains the most recent 
updates, besides texlive2010.iso in the future?

Thank you very much.

With kind regards,

Christoph Trumpp

Dear forum,

consider the following code:

I compiled this code using pdflatex (TeX Live 2010). If I try to copy 
the \ne-symbol in the corresponding pdf-file with the mouse cursor, I 
get an equality-sgin (=) instead. I only tried this with evince as pdf

also tried to use something like

\pdfglyphtounicode{notequal}{...}

without success. I'm very grateful for any ideas.

Well.  Acrobat Reader X shews the fonts as embedded subsets of
CMR10 & CMSY10.  The <= will undoubtedly come from CMSY10.  But where
it will lie within the embedded subset is anyone's guess.  Having
copied it with the mouse cursor, what will you have on the clipboard ?
A font/glyph pair, or just an ASCII or Unicode character.  I don't
know.  But even if it were a font/glyph pair, do you have any
applications that can display characters from CMSY10 ?  I don't.
(Unless CMSY10 is already embedded in the document, that is).
So, to be honest, I don't think that what you are hoping for
is feasible.  But I might be wrong :-)

A quick peek in plain.tex shows that, at least there, \ne is an
over-struck combination of two characters:

	\def\neq{\not=} \let\ne=\neq

If LaTeX does the same thing, then there is no single "not equal" glyph.

I have two papers by the same author, both dated 1971.

The later paper (which cites the first) gets listed *before*

I would like to get the earlier paper listed first.  Is there
any simple way to achieve this?  I am using vanilla bibtex and

Here's an example of what to put in your bib file:

@PREAMBLE{ {\providecommand{\noopsort}[1]{}} }
...
@ARTICLE{Rayleigh1,
AUTHOR = "{\noopsort{Rayleigh}}{Lord Rayleigh}",
...
}

N.B. this is easily fond using "bibtex sorting" e.g. in google an is an FAQ.

It depends on the used fonts and packages.

If the font does not contain U+2260 (notequals), then
at least the ActualText feature of the PDF format could be
used (see PDF spec.):

\documentclass{minimal}
\pagestyle{empty}
\usepackage{accsupp}
\CheckCommand*{\ne}{\not=}
\renewcommand*{\ne}{%
  \BeginAccSupp{method=hex,unicode,ActualText=2260}%
  \not=%
  \EndAccSupp{}%
}
\begin{document}
$\ne$
\end{document}

Yours sincerely

Thank you. That worked. I must say however that I would not have discerned
that the ``Lord Rayleigh'' example given under the first hit on a Google
search pertained to my problem if I had not had the benefit of your advice
that it did so pertain.  It seemed to be about suppressing unwanted ``prefixes''
like ``Lord'' in the sorting process.  The fact that it also applied to my
problem was, to say the least, unclear.

For the record, what I wound up doing --- and what I think would generally
solve problems of the ilk of that with which I was faced --- was:

	author = "{\noopsort{HawkesA}}{Alan G. Hawkes}",

for the item which I wished to come first in the sort, and

	author = "{\noopsort{HawkesB}}{Alan G. Hawkes}",

for the item which I wished to come second.

Thanks again.

	cheers,

Thanks to all who replied. To answer Philip Taylor's question: I do not 
have a reasonable application for this copy procedure. I discovered 
these things while converting my PhD thesis to the PDF/A format in order 
to satisfy the library specifications. I found out that the commands

\pdfglyphtounicode{multicloseright}{22CA}
\pdfgentounicode=1

allow me to copy $\rtimes$ (from amssymb) to the corresponding unicode 
character. So, I wondered if this is also possible with $\ne$.

Heiko Oberdiek's approach works perfectly. I also want to point out that 
I do not actually need this for my thesis, since the PDF/A-1b format 
hopefully suffices (instead of the more restricted PDF/A-1a format)

Thank you again,
Benjamin

I agree that searches for TeX solutions are often non so intuitive and it
does take a little imagination, but the solutions are generally there in the
FAQ and can be found.

And of course, the way one actually solves any given problem is a matter of
taste - one suggestion though is always to try and make sure that it will
always work - for example, did you check what happens if you later introduce
a frther reference such as

	author = "{Adrian Hawkes}" ?

	Uh, no.  I didn't.  That would mess things up, wouldn't it?

	Back to the drawing board.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=PZ_3=m7niUyxPGXS7g04Pw-GBeyR=biwXFGtN@mail.gmail.com>

I'm debugging a C++ program that reads an XML file and outputs a LaTeX file,
ready for typesetting.  Due to the nature of the XML, there are some
redundant commands in the .tex file, but I don't think they should cause the
weird behavior I'm seeing.  Basically, I use \fontspec{Minion Pro} and
\fontsize{14.000000}{14.000000}. (The \fontsize gets used some extra times,
but always at 14 pts.  However, in the resulting PDF from XeLaTeX (XeTeX,
Version 3.1415926-2.2-0.9997.4 (MiKTeX 2.9)), I get plain text in a small
font, and bold or italic text in what appears to be the correct size.  Can
anyone explain this?  A short snippet is below.

Thank you!

\fontsize takes effect only after a \selectfont commmand. \itshape
and \bfseries internally issues such a \selectfont.

Excellent!  Just adding \selectfont after each \fontsize command seems to
have fixed the problem.

It seems to me that FAQ "Things with ?TeX? in the name":

    http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=texthings

nicely covers the questions and adds a few things.

Some others are listed in 

     http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/

while not all of these entries are formats
(at least, there is no "generic" format). 

The abovementioned FAQ page additionally mentions Eplain,
and here may be an occasion to learn how "important" it is. 

Or maybe better: What reasons could there be 
to use Eplain instead of LaTeX or ConTeXt?

... or not to use ...?

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Thanks for that pointer!  That is indeed an excellent summary of what I was
considering, with useful links for more info.

For the moment, I've decided to go with LaTeX on XeTeX ... xelatex.  The
ability to use system fonts and the fontspec package is of paramount
importance for this project.  The textpos package is also essential, and
seems to do what I need.

Thanks for the information!

Is there a downloadable copy of 2.09 anywhere ideally for all Linux, Cygwin,

Howdy,

Have you tried to simply compile the file? I believe LaTeX2e will try (with no guarantees) to emulate 2.09 if it runs across a \documentstyle command.

Good Luck,

Yes, sure: "new LaTeX" when notices \documentstyle becomes an old one
(or behaves as such)

I've been Googling for information on how to use \includegraphics with

Thank you, Heiko.  No hope for us XeTeX users?  Hmmm.

It's more complicate, it depends on:
* Primitive support:
  * pdfTeX: \pdfximage
    file name argument as general text (curly braces).
  * XeTeX: \XeTeXpicfile, \XeTeXpdffile
    file name argument in quotes, at least it is known that
    quotes can be used because of XeTeX.
    That solves the problem for spaces, but how quotes
    can be used inside file names?
* File test for existence
  It is needed by graphics package, e.g. for finding a file
  a supported extension.
  * pdfTeX: several primitves can be used, pdftex.def uses
    \pdffilesize with file name argument as general text.
    And package `grffile' cures the problem for package graphics.
  * XeTeX: \openin with file name in quotes.
    Of course, graphics.sty does not know about quotes. 
* Driver part:
  * pdfTeX: PDF driver is part of pdfTeX, thus it's no issue here.
  * XeTeX: Seems to be supported, but I don't know a specification
    of xdv format.

Thus I see, I will update package `grffile' to support
spaces with XeTeX.

Yours sincerely

I've tried quoting with XeTeX (Mik2.9), but no go.  I've tried both "s
around the entire file spec., and replacing the " " with "\ ".  Neither of
those approaches work.  Is there some other method of quoting?

A spec. for xdv would be very useful indeed!

That would be fantastic!

Quoting works if you use \XeTeXpicfile or \XeTeXpdffile directly.
However it doesn't work in \includegraphics (without package grffile),
because the space is also used as terminator in macro processing
of the file name.

In general the quoting feature can't be tested in a simple reliable
manner without trying file open. I assume that quoting is always
available in case of XeTeX. Because I couldn't find it documentated,
it might be luck if the assumption is right.

Please try version 1.13:
  http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~oberdiek/tmp/grffile.pdf
(The .pdf file contains .dtx file attachted. 'tex grffile.dtx'
extracts the package.)

Will this work with \includegraphics in XeTeX, or should I be using
\XeTeXpicfile and \XeTeXpdffile ?

I'm afraid I don't understand.  How do I refer to the PDF file in this
command?

grffile extends \includegraphics so use that.

Downlad the .pdf

Open it in Adobe Acrobat (a recent version)

Click on the paper clip icon (usually in the bottom-left corner)

Drag grffile.dtx to a convenient location and process it as you would any .dtx

Thank you!  Is there some canonical location where this is supposed to go?
 I'm running MiKTeX 2.9.  I put the file in C:\Program Files\MiKTeX
2.9\source\latex\grffile\grffile.dtx.  However, when I try to tex it, as
Heiko suggested, I get:


Generating file(s) grffile.ins grffile.drv grffile.sty grffile-test1.tex
! Cannot find file grffile.dtx.
\readsource ...ot find file \uptospace #1 \qStop }

Process the dtx in some temporary folder outside miktex. Miktex
blocks pdflatex from finding files in roots.

Argh!

Ok, I was able to do this in the local directory where my .tex files are,
and it worked!  Thank you, Heiko and other who helped!  This is a great
relief.

Hi,

 

 

I've just installed MikTeX and TeXnicCentre, and I'm not sure how to use the
software. Can you point me in the right direction?

Subject: [texhax] Wrong Labelling
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=5dHsy8v33FkUVjVnHHf7auzyj9sVbE+ew-Hpq@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,
somehow the number of my figures are wrong in the text of my paper,
all figures after figure 7 are labeled figure 7 or 5.1. in the text,
although the labeling is correct in the caption of the figure. I checked
that the label {} and ref{} content match (latex whould give me ?? in case
they don't match anyway) and I did put the command  \label{} after \caption
when including the figure.

Really don't know what to do. I exchanged \label{histogram} with
\label{fig.histogram}

here is an example of how I include figures:

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=0.6 \linewidth]{pLate.png}
\textit{\caption{Relative Rise in Share of Pupils at Upper Secondary School
between June and July, (Both Parents have the same Education Level)}}
\label{percentage-late}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

Thank you very much!

Hi guys,

I somehow cannot include longtables in my paper. The tables look fine and
have zero mistakes when just compiling the single table but when I try to
include them in the appendix of my paper with \input{table} , I cannot
compile the paper anymore. Does the package "longtable" clash with some
particular package? I have included longtables in previous papers before
without problems.

Thank you very much,
Claudia

If you truly wish to directly use TeX, I'd suggest starting w/ the Not so short guide:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf

If you simply wish to easily author documents and have them typeset by LaTeX you may wish to consider LyX, a what-you-see-is-what-you-mean graphical front-end to LaTeX:

Hi Harry,

did you already configure TeXniccenter in the right way? After installation
you need to specify the path to the mikTeX executables.

You can easily check:

1) Are Outputprofiles defined? (Do you have a dropdown box saying "LaTeX =>
PDF") in Texniccenter?

2) Create a very basic document


\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

Hello Harry

\end{document}

save it and try to compile it  either by the respective button or in the
menu (something like output => active document => Create)

Do you get an output file (DVI, PDF)?

If it worked check the not so short introduction...

Uwe

Hello,

Can someone help me figure out a way to code the attached math expression?

I found a helpful article here:
http://andrewjpage.com/index.php?/archives/43-Multirow-and-multicolumn-spanning-with-latex-tables.html

I started modifying the example there and got stuck on how to make the bracketed expression  occupy two rows:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
\multirow & 1 \hfill 2 \\ \hline
\multirow a & \left\{
        \begin{array}{cc}\hfill \mathrm{{x} }\hfill & \hfill \mathrm{{b} }\hfill
          \\
        \hfill \mathrm{{w} }\hfill & \hfill \mathrm{{z} }\hfill \end{array}
        \right\} \\
b & \phantom{M}\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

(I added the lines just to see what's going on)

Thanks,

Subject: [texhax] Some help with xy
Message-ID: <BB2487F6-5BCF-4976-87CC-6E2D4BE56CEA@alphabyte.co.nz>

Hi all,

Sorry for the cross post. Could do with some advice with xy.

I want to have the arrows that overlap the text (and frames) in the  
minimal example below just point at the left edge of the right frames.  
I should mention to ignore the frames themselves. They will be removed  
when I have figured out what is going on. I had previously had this in  
another document and when it was typeset the arrows all nicely lined  
up along the frame edges, both left and right. Somewhere in the past  
few years (well, since 2008 anyway) something seems to have changed in  
TeXLive and it wasn't this.

Oh, and I am now using parboxes instead of txt because it gives better  
control over the text formatting.

Cheers
Alan

Do you mean the actual number given in the caption, or the number
when referring to the caption with \ref?

> \textit{\caption{Relative Rise in Share of Pupils at Upper Secondary School

Here your label refers to the enclosing section, not to the
figure number, because the font change has limited the scope
of the "current reference".  You need to put the label command
inside the caption text, or immediately after the end of the 
caption (before any other } or \end).

Hi Abraham,

I don't think using a table is going to achieve what you want.

Have a read of this page:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics

Scoot down to the section on matrices.

* \caption is inside a group (\textit), therefore \label references
  the entry that was active before that group.
    \textit{\caption{...}\label{...}}
  But \caption inside \textit doesn't look quite sound.
  The font of a caption can easily be changed using the
  package `caption', e.g.
    \usepackage[font=it]{caption}
  or
    \usepackage{caption}
    \captionsetup{font=it}

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=jRgoUrR=md+9SZQvEWySEiB3R6X2+bgLXACfQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a couple of .jpg files that are 1024 x 768 pixels, with a resolution
of 96dpi.  If I just include them in my LaTeX document with:

\includegraphics{xyz.jpg}

they appear on the page at 1024bp x 768bp.  In effect, the resolution is
ignored, and they're scaled up by 1/3.

Is there a way to get LaTeX to scale based on the resolution in the file,
without my having to explicitly read the .jpg file and get the resolution
myself?

I'm writing a program that generates LaTeX from XML, so I'd like to simply
tell LaTeX to do the right thing, without having to explicitly check the
resolution in every file to generate my \includegraphics command.

I'm looking at the options in D. Carlisle's _Packages in the 'graphics'
bundle_ document, but I don't see any options that look like what I'm
seeking.

Thank you!

Which makes me believe that the program (you're not saying what you're
using) thinks the images have 300dpi.

What's the output of
- "identify -verbose" (from imagemagick)
- "jhead -v" (from jhead)
of the picture? Can you put one online for study?

I just installed imagemagick.  The output from "identify -verbose" is below.

Sorry, I just now got around to trying this.  It looks like the pdfpages package mentioned in that page will do what I want (I couldn't figure out how to use the combine package, but it looks like it is too complex for what I need).  But it looks like \includepdf[fitpaper=true]{letter} does the trick.  The only issue is that the letter page is slightly smaller than the other ones, which must be because one of the two documents is not really creating 8.5x11 in. pages like it should be (although Skim reports both as being 8.3x11.7 in., so I don't know).  But it isn't too important.

Also, sorry for asking a FAQ question.  I tried Googleing it first, but perhaps due to the nature of the question, I couldn't find the answer.

The resolution is 72dpi, not 96dpi.

width = (1024 dots / 72 (dots/in)) = 14.2222 in
Unit conversion: 1in = 72bp
==> width = 1024bp

Therefore the image is shown in the correct size on the paper.
The graphicx package allows you to scale the image,
see options `scale' or `width'.
Documentation of LaTeX's graphics bundle in file `grfguide.pdf'.

Interesting.  The Windows Photo Viewer clearly lists it as 96dpi
horizontally and vertically:

[image: WindowsPhotoViewer.gif]


I've run into this before ... where different tools report different
resolutions for JPEG files.  If memory serves, ImageMagick always reported
72dpi, whereas the IJG JPEG Library reported something else.  I think this
is the result of multiple file formats with potentially inconsistent fields.

Yes, that's the document I've been looking at.

Then your file `letter.pdf' has probably size DIN A4.

Keep in mind that LaTeX doesn't tell the output driver the output
page size. You need a package like geometry, typearea,
hyperref, pdftex.def, some classes (KOMA-Script, memoir, ...)
with correct (driver and page size) options,
 especially in case of DVI drivers.

Interestingly, Adobe Photoshop CS5 and Adobe InDesign CS5 report the image
resolution as 96ppi.

I'm using XeTeX (xelatex).  Is that using ImageMagick internally to get the
resolution?

    I've just installed MikTeX and TeXnicCentre, and I'm not sure how to use the
    software. Can you point me in the right direction?

Thanks, Martin, for the tip about jhead.  I was not familiar with that tool.
 That appears to agree with Adobe, Windows, etc:

Maybe. However, the EXIF header of your example also shows 72dpi.

AFAIK, no, but maybe the same library might be used.

Do you have an example image that can be analyzed?

What's the result of:

\sbox0{\includegraphics{Chrysanthemum.jpg}}

Thank you, Heiko.  So it appears that pdfTeX gets it right, but ImageMagick
and XeTeX incorrectly use 72dpi as the resolution.

If I could use the fontspec package with pdfTeX, I'd switch to that.  As is,
I suppose I have to check the pixel dimensions and resolution somehow in my
own code, and simply specify the desired width and height in the tex file.

Thank you.

Probably because pdfTeX + what fontspec gives access to (+ bunches of 
other things) = LuaTeX (LuaLaTeX when used with the LaTeX format). And 
LuaTeX users tend to see LuaTeX as the solution to most existing 
problems, including probably world poverty, hence our smiles that never 
fade and our air of commiseration toward people who're stuck with other 
engines.

Thanks, Paul.  As I mentioned, I have considered LuaTeX.  It does, 
indeed, look very promising.  However, from what I gathered from various 
Web sites and lists, it's still a work in progress.  Robustness and 
performance are not at the level of other engines at this point.  Would 
you agree with that assessment?

I'd be very happy to use something that solves world poverty, but it has 
to hold up in a demanding print production environment.

No, unless performance means speed (in which case, yes, LuaTeX is a 
little bit slower).
As for robustness, bugs are regularly found in LuaTeX, but not the kind 
you're likely to encounter, unless you start doing advanced things that 
can't be done with other engines, so they're rather easy to ignore.

If the environment is so demanding I for one would use the most advanced 
engine. And I do think that LuaTeX is the most advanced engine indeed, 
since I can't see what others can do that it can't, whereas I see tons 
of things it can do that others can't.

Again, as I've already stated on this list, I'm not saying LuaTeX would 
be better than XeTeX. Here I'm just addressing your situation, which 
seems to be: pdfTeX with TTF/OTF. If you can make do without what pdfTeX 
offers, then XeTeX is perfectly ok. So much for world poverty, though.

Best,
Paul

Analysis:

0x0000: APP0 (length 16)
  JFIF-Header
  * Unit: dots per inch
  * Xdensity: 96
  * Ydensity: 96
  * no thumbnail
0x0014: APPE (length 14)
  Adobe Application-Specific JPEG Marker
0x0024: APP1 (length 4957)
  Exif with TIFF-Header
  No resolution unit that means the default is 1in.
  XResolution: 72
  YResolution: 72
...

Conclusion: The problem is the image file itself that contains
contradictory data about the resolution. Some programs
are using 96 dpi from the JFIF header, others are using
72 dpi from the EXIF data.

Yours sincerely

Thank you, Heiko.  I agree that having both JFIF and EXIF data is
over-specifying the information, and creates opportunities for such
inconsistencies.  In fact, files with such inconsistencies are *very*
common.  I've run into this situation, and had to code around it, many times
over the years.

There should be some consensus on which overrides which in cases where the
image is inconsistent.  It seems that much of the more widely used software
(Photoshop, InDesign, Windows, pdfTeX, the IJG JPEG library, etc.) use the
JFIF data, while ImageMagick and XeTeX use the EXIF data.

Thanks,

I consider it as a bug of the application that creates the image file.
Why should one case more "bug free" than the other?

JFIF data are very easy to parse, but very few information is provided.
EXIF data needs more effort for parsing, but can provide a variety
of information. File formats with redundancy involved have the risks
of inconsistency. Fix the inconsistencies and the file reading
applications are happy.

You are, of course, free to take that position.  However, in a very large
number of cases, with a very large number of files, users will not get what
they want or expect.  The Chrysanthemum.jpg image comes from the Corbis
library, a pretty large stock house, I think.  I think Photoshop and other
widely used apps commonly write files like this.  So you can either "be
right," or "do the right thing."  I think it's like saying "HTML is wrong
because it allows style information  like <b> and <i> to be set explicitly.
 Therefore, my browser will not support HTML."

In the printing and publishing world, at least in my experience, Photoshop
is *the* de facto standard image manipulation tool.  Any file that comes
from Photoshop is, by definition, "correct."

In my world if an application writes a file which simultaneously
asserts that the single image in that file is at 96dpi and at 72dpi,
the application is creating "incorrect" files. I think this means
that I live in a world where logic trumps bad programming.

Being a standard tool does not make you bug-free, it merely
gives you the political clout to compel others to deal with your
buggy software. I wouldn't personally be surprised if many of
the people involved with projects such as Xe(la)tex don't feel
particularly strongly motivated by attempts to wield
that clout.

Yes, many engineers used to take that position regarding software usability
too.  If you use the software incorrectly, it's your own fault if it
crashes, destroys your data, corrupts your hard drive, or whatever.  Then we
started making software that handles exceptions.  The world is a nicer
place.

It's not a matter of wielding clout.  My point about Photoshop is not that
Adobe cares one iota about what LaTeX does.  I'm trying to emphasize that
there will be *very* many files which exhibit this bug.  You can choose to
fail processing these files, or you can give inconsistent results (vis,
pdfTeX vs. XeTeX), or you can try to provide the most useful behavior.
 Engineering is about trade-offs.

I don't see any problem here.  Both, pdfTeX and XeTeX behave correctly.
If you are not satisfied with the results, repair your broken files.
TeX engines are not about trade-offs.  Crap in, crap out.

You can use TTH (TeX to HTML) to convert to HTML, and then open the HTML in
Word.  I've done that with LaTeX documents in the past.  You might have to
clean up the Word document a bit by hand, but it's pretty effective.

Message-ID: <A356EE70-ABB7-4CE8-802D-816CC9671898@gmail.com>

I'm trying to create underlined text, but with numbers under the underlines. (I need to refer to the underlined pieces of text by number.) If that's confusing, imagine being able to do the same thing with an underline as you're able to do with an arrow like \xleftarrow[below]{above}, where the [below] and {above} text end up below and above the arrow with subscript/superscript sizing, respectively. 

Of course, I tried \underline[option]{text}, but was sad to discover no option existed.

Anyone have any advice?

Thanks!

If that's confusing, imagine being able to do the same thing with an underline as you're able to do with an arrow like \xleftarrow[below]{above}, where the [below] and {above} text end up below and above the arrow with subscript/superscript sizing, respectively.

If your underlined text is not supposed to break, then the following 
might do:

\makeatletter
\newbox\uboxa
\newbox\uboxb
\def\unum{%
   \@ifnextchar[
     {\@unum}
     {\@unum[\dp\uboxa]}%
   }

\def\@unum[#1]#2#3{%
   \setbox\uboxa=\hbox{#2}%
   \setbox\uboxb=\vbox{%
     \copy\uboxa
     \kern.1em\hrule\kern.1em
     \hbox to \wd\uboxa{\hfil#3\hfil}}%
   \ht\uboxb=\ht\uboxa
   \dp\uboxb=#1\relax
   \quitvmode\box\uboxb
   }
\makeatother


Then:

\unum[<depth>]{<text>}{<number>}

produces an underlined <text> with <number> below (or anything else, for 
that matter); the depth of that is <depth>, which defaults to the 
natural depth of <text> (as if the rule and the number below did not 
exist). The line

     \kern.1em\hrule\kern.1em

in the definition of \@unum can be modified to set the amount of space 
surrounding the rule.

Now if you want your text to break across lines, it'll be a little bit 
harder...

Best,
Paul

I guess it is not a template but rather selfmade.

Looks not too difficult, just a bunch of tables.

I will choose to blame Twitter this time. I have noticed two strange  
phenomena in the past few months. The first is that from time to time  
people seem to regard email as sequential rather than as an  
asynchronous communication tool which has led to some rather bizarre  
conversations where people have elected to read emails from various  
points in a thread but as they have received them, and then responded  
as though they were sequential. The other seems to be like the sound- 
bite nature of Twitter where currency of the conversation rules and as  
a result there seems to be an apparent reluctance to search archives  
for previous postings, it's as though once an email has passed by it  
no longer exists or is no longer relevant.

Needless to say, perhaps, but the link to the archive is in the texhax  
footer.

Joan might notice that from the tenor of these responses she is not  
being regarded as a heretic. The issue is technological not  
ideological :)

Cheers
Alan

Hi Paul,
nice macro.  However, if you don't provide the optional argument
consecutive lines overlap.  It seems that you determine \dp\uboxa
before something is put into the box.  Replacing the default with
\baselineskip yields reasonable results.
 
\def\unum{%
   \@ifnextchar[
     {\@unum}
     {\@unum[\baselineskip]}%

Furthermore, if you want all lines to be aligned vertically, you can
put a \strut in front of #2.  It's also quite convenient to replace #3
by {\scriptsize#3} or {\tiny#3}.  If appropriate, #3 can be replaced
by a counter.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Actually I asked
>> (How often is this asked here?)
because I didn't know and was not willing to find out.

I just can say that this hasn't been the first time. 

As far as I remember, I have only searched the texhax archive 
for postings I had in mind, e.g., my own, and this is usually 
very quite time-consuming, and sometimes I couldn't find 
the posting I was looking for.

Typing an e-mail often is much less exhausting than 
guessing a good search string, sometimes finding nothing, 
sometimes getting many hits that don't help, though 
after trying some of them you are so tired that you can't 
do any other serious work the rest of the day. 

E.g., "tex to word", the subject, has 793 matches, and the present 
subject is not among the first 20 ... and I really must stop here.

So much on my view on searching archives and googling for tonight ... 

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Emacs can do so by typing
C-\ and selecting an input method for unicode, e.g., japanese
However, I guess you need to make sure that your terminal is capable to
display unicode characters properly.
This might differ from your x-window settings.
E.g. I can read unicode characters in urxvt or any other x-based
terminal emulator.
On a real terminal all I get are squares which might be due to some
misconfiguration. Since I seldomly use the real terminals I didn't fix this.

Greetings

Torsten

It was on purpose: let the text have its natural depth, i.e. as if lines 
and numbers did not exist. So consequently multiple lines overlap 
indeed. Anyway that was probably not the best default setting, but I 
don't know where Evan want such text to occurr.

Yes, yes and yes. Especially the strut.

I have used pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to convert the
document from Latex (or even xelatex see pandoc documentation) to Open
Office and from there to Word.  It seems to work really well.

Hi Joan.

this seems quite a common request in a Banana dominated world, but as
well a sound solution seems impossible (how would one drop the
advantages of TeX et al. for some arbitrary, ever-changing subsystem of
a specialized, though almost monopolic, operating system)

After trying several more direct methods as mentioned by others on this
thread, I was quite successful when converting a PDF generated with Tex
et al. to a doc or rtf document using commercial, but relatively cheap,
pdf2doc converters. Two of them even kept the correct layout except for
the availability of some fonts.

The converters I used are  SolidConverter, which keeps the layout as-is
from the PDF putting several ?s-doc-boxes around the text, and
PDFConverter Professional, with an almost similar result. Since my
experience with these tools is already some years ago, this route
(TeX->PDF->.doc) may have matured even more now.

I think this is largely a matter of getting your Terminal program to
work with UTF-8 characters.  I use KDE's Konsole, so for me, this is a
matter of going to Settings > Edit Current Session > Advanced, and
setting "Default character encoding: UTF-8".  

 From a shell prompt, I can type 

   <Compose> " u

and get the character ? (u with an umulat), and I can type

   <Compose> | c

and get the character ? (the symbol for cents).

I get the same results with ed, vi, and emacs -nw.

<Compose> means "the compose key", and you may have to configure it
via your window manager.  The key sequences themselves are listed in
/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose.

This is generally about as much UTF-8 as I need.

To see a list of UTF-8 fonts on your system, 

  xlsfonts | grep 10646

should show the ones that are available.

I hope that helps.

Steve

Hi,

I have tried to put various delimeters around accented math symbols in LaTeX, but I'm not very happy with the results.  For example, neither $[\overrightarrow{PQ}]$ nor $\left[\overrightarrow{PQ}\right]$ look very good to me.  If anyone can suggest a (hopefully reasonably simple) way to put delimeters around accented math symbols that looks better, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks.

have you tried scaling the fences manually?

i.e. $\bigl[\overrightarrow{PQ}\bigr]$ or similar with one of the ither

Thanks for your response.  Yes, I did experiment with different size fences.  I still can't get it to look very good, in my opinion.  If the fence extents to the top of the accent, then it extends too far below the symbol.  That is, I'd like to be able to "center" the fences better.

They are centered. It just does not look good if one starts to raise the 
fences just because the height of the material is larger than the depth.

for example there is no reason to fully fencing a sum

\Big(\sum_{k} \dots \Big)

I usually enlarge the fences a little but does not extend it abot 
accents etc. There is no need for it. We just need to fence it in the 
horizontal sirection no the vertical

Message-ID: <90A9256F-1B80-4EEB-9FFB-001E8423E275@phil.uu.nl>

Dear reader,

Because of computer failure (a Macintosh broke down) I had to reinstall texlive, which went like a charm. 
Unfortunately, there is a conflict between texlive-2010 and the beamer class, and I really need beamer for my classes at university.

The best temporary solution I have come up with is to downgrade to texlive 2009 or 2008, but I cannot find the mpkg.zip for either of these LaTeX-distributions.
I looked here:
http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html
but had no clue what to do with the files on offer.

Could you possibly point me to a site where I could download said older mpkg.zip files for texlive 2009 or 2008?

I apologize for disturbing you with this, but I am getting rather desparate.

Yours,

Rob van Gerwen

Howdy,

I assume you installed TeX Live 2010 using MacTeX-2010. Also assuming you are using Mac OS X 10.5 or later you need to use TeX Live Utility to update the distribution. There have been many updates since TeX Live 2010 was first released. You can find TeX Live Utility in /Applications/TeX/.

Good Luck,

Message-ID: <AANLkTimdbTzrhF9SpT8pFTOqW0rvKWRKDBkDUtEEQyL2@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to use XeLaTeX with the fontspec and setspace packages.  However,
using \setstretch seems to override the previously specified \fontsize.  So,
for example

\fontsize{20}{20}
\selectfont
\setstretch{1.2}
\fontspec{Lucida Sans Unicode}

I would expect to produce 20 point Lucida Sans on 24 point leading, but I'm
*not* getting 20 pt text.  Is there some magical order in which I have to
specify these? Thanks!

Here's a complete sample that demonstrates this:

\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage[landscape]{geometry}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{setspace}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
\pagestyle{empty}
\setlength{\topmargin}{36.000000bp}
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{36.000000bp}
\begin{document}

\setlength{\topmargin}{36.000000bp}
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{36.000000bp}
\raggedright

{\par \fontsize{20.000000}{20.000000}

Subject: [texhax] filling all the way down
Message-ID: <BC0DF525-3E0D-43B0-BCA5-BD605FB6B43F@as220.org>

Hello all:

I want to create a single long paragraph of shrinking font sizes all the way down to the illegible.  (It's a spoof of the fine print on contracts and copyright notices.)  I can shrink the font in the middle of a paragraph, but I can't shrink the \baselineskip, and if I arrange it as consecutive paragraphs run together, the last line of each paragraph isn't filled.

I thought I remembered an example of this somewhere in my TeX library, but my hunting hasn't turned it up yet.

How can I:

  - Fill the last line of a paragraph (or at least dictate that TeX make a stab at doing so), or
  - Change the \baselineskip while a paragraph is underway.

Is either of these possible, or can someone suggest a third way to do this?

Many thanks,

 -Tom

one \vadjust per line, but this will need some empirical
fine tuning.

Yes and maybe, respectively.

Hello!

Asking for help again.

Instead of \footnote, we use \thanks after the name of an author. The  
use of \thanks produces the symbols "asterisk," "dagger," etc. in the  
footnote. Instead of these symbols, I would like numbers to appear in  
the footnote for \thanks. How will I do it?

Yes and yes.

a) TeX can be forced to use \lineskip between the lines instead
    of the \baselineskip algorithm.

    \lineskiplimit=\maxdimen % turn off \baselineskip
    \lineskip=2pt % put 2pt between two lines

b) If whatsits are not used (color, \index, ...) then
   the paragraph can be put in a \parbox (or environment
   minipage):
   \parbox{\linewidth}{%
     \Huge ...
     \tiny ...
     \par
     % Box with wrong line skips.
     % Now the lines can be put into boxes using \lastbox.
     % The interline glue is available via \lastskip
     % and the last node type can be inspected by \lastnodetype.
     % Then put the together with better interline glue
     % For example by inspecting the height of the lines.
   }

Yours sincerely

Aha.  Thank you to Barbara, Phil and Heiko.  That's exactly what I needed.  (And yes, to the geographically close one of you, it is always a pleasure to catch up, if only a tiny bit.)

\setstretch calls \normalsize. So move it before your \fontsize
command.

Aha!  Thank you.  I found surprisingly little information on \setstretch.

That fixes the size of the text, but I'm not getting the stretch.  The
example below outputs the same paragraph twice, once with default spacing,
and once with \setstretch{1.6}.  They look identical to me.

Line spacing depends on the settings at the end of a paragraph. So
use \par before closing the group:

....lectus.\par}

Hi There,

I am trying to create a title block within an article and have
struggled with the \vspace command. ?I must confess I do not truly
understand this command since it seems to work haphazardly in my
experience.  Sometimes it seems to work if I put a blank line before
it but that did not work in this case.  I wish to encroach on the
white space at the top of a document to ensure I can fit a quote at
the bottom of the page. ?Can anyone direct me?  Here is most of the
tex:

i'm not entirely sure that this will work,
but there's one very clear problem --
\vspace is ignored/gets lost at the top of
a page.  if you want to apply space to the
top of a page, use \vspace* .

Barbara,

Thanks for the reply.  I was unfamiliar with an asterisk version of
\vspace.  Unfortunately, all that seems to do is insert a blank page
prior to the start of the document and page 2 still runs into page 3
for the quote.

i was afraid that might happen.  it seems
that \maketitle assumes that it's at the
top of a page, and if it isn't, it forces
one.  yes -- in article.cls, \maketitle
calls \@maketitle, and \@maketitle begins
with \newpage.

that's probably common to most document
classes, so what i would do is go into the
document class you're using and look for
where the spacing at the top of the page
is defined, copy out that definition, and
intervene there.  it'll be ugly, but i
don't see any other obvious approach.

A little googling finds the titling package which will do what you want
I think:

Try:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{titling}
\setlength{\droptitle}{-0.5in}

\begin{document}

\title{My title}
\author{Me, myself, and I}
\date{22 Dec}

\maketitle

\title{\kern -4\baselineskip

seems all that is needed here ...

I downloaded tex live on my windows XP computer and it would make pdf files.


My computer crashed and now under windows 7,  tex live does not make pdf

What software do I need to make pdf files from plain TeX under windows 7? 

Thank you, Jim FitzSimons

Simple question, simple answer: You need TeX Live.

Did you simply copy Windows 7 over XP or did you install TeX Live
under Windows 7 again?

I don't know how to help you unless you provide more information.  If
you run pdftex, you either get a PDF file or an error message (hopefully).  
If you don't understand the error message, post it to the list.

I want to define a macro :

\newcommand\answer[4]{.....}

If  the length of all arguments 1 to 4 is less than 0.25\textwidth, then I
want to typeset that as

 \begin{multicols}{4}

\begin{itemize}

\item[a)] #1

\item[b)] #2

\item[c)] #3

\item[d)] #4

\end{itemize}

\end{multicols}


if the length of one of the arguments from 1 to 4 is less than 0.5\textwidth
but greater than 0.25\textwidth provided the length of no arguments from 1
to 4 is greater than 0.5\textwidth, then I want to typeset this as:


\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{itemize}

\item[a)] #1

\item[b)] #2

\item[c)] #3

\item[d)] #4

\end{itemize}

\end{multicols}


and finally if the length of any arguments from 1 to 4 is bigger than
\textwidth, then I just want to typeset this as:


\begin{itemize}

\item[a)] #1

\item[b)] #2

\item[c)] #3

\item[d)] #4

\end{itemize}

How could I do this?

Thanks

\item[c)] #3

Message-ID: <22936A69-DAA2-4E2B-BA9F-21C92C27CE88@gmail.com>

I'm trying to write myself a little calculus reference sheet, and I started with something like this:

=============================================
Leibniz notation: $${\rm d}f \over {\rm d}x$$
\bye
=============================================

The trouble is that the displayed df/dx get placed smack in the center of the page, and it wastes a lot of whitespace on the side. I want to cram all of these calculus notes into just one page, so all of the whitespace which display-math-mode wastes is a big no-no; yet, I still do need the visual style which display-math-mode offers, formatting this whole reference sheet in just in-line horizontal math mode would look awful.

Any ideas guys?

Dear Lady/Gentleman: I am writing a macro in tex but it is not working. This 
is what I want to do:

I have  a tex file A.tex. In another file, B.tex, I want to read A.tex line 
by line. First problem is when I read the file to, say \a (a token 
variable), it does not read some of tex characters such as %. I want to read 
everything on the line including all the characters. Now suppose I am 
reading the first line to \a and the second line to \b. I would like to 
compare \a and \b and get a true value if they are equal. I am using the 
following macro unsuccesfully.

\newif\ifthesame
\def\isthesame#1#2{\def\one{#1}\def\two{#2}\ifx\one\two\thesametrue\else\thesamefalse}

I always get false for \isthesame{\a}{\b}, even when the two have the same 
values!
I appreciate your help.

Patrick,

If you're willing to take a LaTeX approach (as opposed to a plain TeX
approach), then you should consider the amsmath package.

amsmath provides many environments for laying out equations, and these
environments give you a lot control over placement and the use of
whitespace.  

Here is a brief example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\documentclass[fleqn]{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

A typically arrangement of equation and annotation.
\begin{align*}
  & \frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d}x} && \text{Leibniz notation (frac)} \\
  & \tfrac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d}x} && \text{Leibniz notation (tfrac)}
\end{align*}

If desired, we can swap the ordering
\begin{align*}
  \text{Leibniz notation (frac)} && \frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d}x} \\
  \text{Leibniz notation (tfrac)} && \tfrac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d}x}
\end{align*}

or, condense to a single line.
\begin{align*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d}x} && \text{Leibniz notation (frac)}
  && \tfrac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d}x} && \text{Leibniz notation (tfrac)}
\end{align*}

\end{document}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What did you do for the cases where

(a) the length of one of the arguments from 1 to 4 is less than
     0.5\textwidth but greater than 0.25\textwidth and the length of at least
     one argument from 1 to 4 is greater than 0.5\textwidth,

(b) then length of all of the arguments from 1 to 4
     is greater than 0,5\textwidth but less than \textwidth

as neither of these appear covered by your original desiderata.

In my sweet humble way: my fifinddo.sty, see 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/nicetext

does this, i.e., by default it reads files line by line "in text mode", but you can choose portions of "TeX mode" at options.

It is not very well-developed now, I have sat hours trying to understand my documentation.

But you could just focus on the so-called "file handling commands", there is a "cheat sheet" about them. The macros can perhaps serve for learning how to do it.

Anyway, difficult for a newbie, perhaps.

In general: as some weeks earlier: read something like the TeXbook to learn how TeX works!

>From own experience I conclude, however, that certain passages need to be read many times ..., or that one must ask Donald Arseneau ...

... or google for the free electronic version of Victor Eijkhout's TeX by Topic!

(Please report what you prefer!)

Now for the specific matter:

\ifx\a\b seems to be the test that may do what you expect. 
So you could replace \def\one{#1} by \let\one#1 etc. 

But your macro as it is may be good for other purposes. 
What you are rather lacking may be a clear idea of what you want. 

If you expect that the result should be true because \a and \b have the same expansion, you might prefer a variant of your macro where you replace \def by \edef ...

This would compare "ultimate expansions".

So you need to make up your mind if you want to compare token lists that are given as macro arguments, or compare first-level expansions, or "ultimate" expansions, ... and you could combine ...

These are not the only possibilities. Instead of expansions, you may be interested in arithmetic evaluations, or typesetting results ... 

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

I want to produce two different sty files and corresponding

Also you can use the enumitem package to alter the "enumerate" environment so that you can type:

\begin{enumerate}[label={\alph*)}]
\item choice 1
\item choice 2
\item choice 3
\end{enumerate }

Rather than manually labelling the choices.

You can put two documentation driver files in the dtx file and
process both, e.g.:
1. tex mypackage.ins
   unpacks mypackage-foo.drv and mypackage-bar.drv,
   and other files like mypackage-foo.sty, mypackage-bar.sty.
2. pdflatex mypackage-foo.drv
   generates mypackage-foo.pdf
3. pdflatex mypackage-bar.drv
   generates mypackage-bar.pdf

I want to cram all of these calculus notes into just one page, so all of the whitespace which display-math-mode wastes is a big no-no; yet, I still do need the visual style which display-math-mode offers, formatting this whole reference sheet in just in-line horizontal math mode would look awful.

Is

	Leibniz notation: $\vcenter {\hfuzz = \hsize \hsize = 0 pt $$\displaystyle {\rm d}f \over {\rm d}x$$}$

of any use ?

Sorry, the \displaystyle is redundant : it was left over
from an earlier dysfunctional hypothesis.  The suggestion
should read :

	Leibniz notation: $\vcenter {\hfuzz = \hsize \hsize = 0 pt $${\rm d}f \over {\rm d}x$$}$

For this, e-TeX is to be preferred; you will then be able to make use
of \readline, which is defined as follows :

"\readline is analogous to \read, but treats each character as if it
  were currently of \catcode 10 (space) or 12 (other); the text thus

  (using \scantokens, q.v.) under different \catcode r?gimes."

I think you want something like this (for B)

\newread \A
\openin \A = A
\loop
     \readline \A to \a
     \unless \ifeof \A
         \readline \A to \b
     \else
         \let \b = \empty
     \fi
     a: \a \endgraf
     b: \b \endgraf
     \ifx \a \b Success\endgraf \else Failure\endgraf \fi
\unless
     \ifeof \A
\repeat
\end

and here is some sample text (for A)

A file that contains the source code and documentation of something that
has to do with TeX. And which produces executable files and
documentation pdfs after fed to (lua/pdf)(la)tex.

Is it possible to start a second TeX-run from the first one without
having to specify --shell-escape?

I want to produce the .sty-file(s) and the .pdf-file(s).

It's a very simple package with just some definitions and some
documentation.

Maintainer am I, user will get the "external" .sty and the .pdf file.
Distribution via CTAN will not happen as it is a private package.

Only maintainer should generate anything.

As mentioned, no wide distribution is planned. Else, there would be no
need for an "external" and "internal" version.

One file for the publisher, one for the author. Sorry that I did not
make this clear. Therefore, no need for texdoc to find anything!

Thanks for all your comments and suggestions,

AFAIK no.

There are tools for splitting (pdftk, ghostscript). But
there are problems with links and you need to know the
page ranges.
  IMHO it's easier to generate the two files in the first place.

If it was a complex document, I'd agree. But as these packages are very
simple, I rather thought about producing a small LaTeX-Dokument using
pdfpages to split it correctly. In that document, the correct page
numbers can be used. There are many ways to do this task, I was just
looking for the one with the least number of steps and files. (A make
file would also help etc. ?)

Unfortunately pdfpages have their limitations:

If we include pdf file into a larger file produced by LaTeX,
hyperlinks (in/external), bookmarks, comments, attachments are gone

Sure attachfile, attachfile2, embedfile are free from this restriction
but the included files are attachments (of different kinds).

Also one can produce pdf from the LaTeX file and then use pdftk, gs or
AA to insert pdf-file. However it would be nice to have pdfpages
capable to do the same - even if on the background pdftk or gs are
used via shell-escape.

tex mypackage.ins             or    tex mypackage.dtx
pdflatex mypackage-A.drv
pdflatex mypackage-B.drv

or

pdflatex mypackage.dtx
pdflatex mypackage-B.drv

or

pdflatex --shell-escape mypackage.dtx


Also you can put the commands in a batch script (.sh, .bat, .cmd, ...).

Yes, that's the way I'll go. Only using lualatex instead ;)

Sure, but that's one more file to distribute.

It was written for PDFBox-0.7.2.jar or PDFBox-0.7.3.jar.
Try to find such an old version. Sorry, I don't have the time
to adapt it to a new library.

I found PDFBox-0.7.3.jar (download
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfbox/files/PDFBox/PDFBox-0.7.3/PDFBox-0.7.3.zip

and after unzipping lib/PDFBox-0.7.3.jar

I placed PDFBox-0.7.3.zip into /usr/share/java (removing symlink to
newer version)

But an error message persists. Documentation says nothing about installation

Stupid: on MacOSX it should be in /Library/Java/Extensions/

Message-ID: <534042.27913.qm@web56906.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

How can I define a command which runs differently based on if an input argument was provided or not?. For example:

\mycommand
would introduce a vsapce of 1cm

whereas 
\mycommand{xyz}
would print xyz

So it's conceptually something likel:
if input argument is missing then
   run this code
else 
   run this code
endif

Season's greetings,
Mike.

that is sadly not possible. You cannot make macros that can run as 
\macro and \macro{...}

the {} are required in both cases (or at least eting a token is required 
in both cases)

as for testing to see if #1 is empty I recommend usinf the etoolbox 
package the \ifblank{#1}{empty}{not empty} is very useful

You can do this:

\def\mycommand{%
  \futurelet\tmp\Mycommand
  }

\def\Mycommand{%
  \ifx\tmp\bgroup
    \expandafter\mycommandwitharg
  \else
    \expandafter\mycommandwithoutarg
  \fi
  }

\def\mycommandwitharg#1{ ... }
\def\mycommandwithoutarg{ ... }

Braces determine whether what follows is an argument or not, i.e. \mycommand\TeX
and \mycommand{\TeX} don't produce the same results.

Best,
Paul

This kind of argument is supported by the xparse package:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{xparse}
\NewDocumentCommand\mycommand{g}{\IfValueTF{#1}{#1}{\vspace{1cm}}}
\begin{document}
test\par
\mycommand
test\par
\mycommand{abc}
test
\end{document}

The argument specifier "g" means "a grouped argument or nothing", and \IfValueTF tests whether a given optional argument was passed.

First, if you had no idea about LaTeX, wouldn't you say that the question is about so-called "optional" arguments and "default" settings?

Now, if you type `vsapce', I guess you must have had a look at LaTeX code once in your life, if only unconsciously and without knowing what LaTeX is.

You may then dare to try a second encounter with LaTeX. In some documentation you may find how wonderfully you can define commands with optional arguments with LaTeX, using the -- --- ---- optional argument of \newcommand ... ..... ....... ! !! !!!

The only trouble with the present question is, that using this idea, you must sacrifice the idea to use curly braces for the optional argument. How important is it to have the optional argument in braces instead of square brackets, as with LaTeX?

    \newcommand\mycommand[1][\vspace{1cm}]{} % or \vsapce?

Then try \mycommand and \mycommand[xyz]

General scheme: \newcommand\mycommand[1][DEFAULT]{...}

> the {} are required in both cases (or at least eting a token is required 
> in both cases)

Internal LaTeX wizardry even allows optional arguments in curly braces:

  \makeatletter
    \newcommand\mycommand{\@ifnextchar\bgroup{\mycommandoptarg}{\vspace{1cm}}}
    \newcommand\mycommandoptarg[1]{#1} % or \let\mycommandoptarg\@firstofone in this case
  \makeatother

Inherent problems: you may type a brace for another reason and don't realize that it will be considered the start of an optional argument. 

That is much worse with LaTeX's square brackets for optional arguments, as some scholars use square brackets for ellipsis or redactional insertions (I experienced this several times):

    Title-like\\ % imitating the manuscript's line break and spacing
   ?[unreadable] ipsum dolor sit amet

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

That would be fixed if \@ifnextchar didn't swallow space tokens. Similar problems arise with amsmath:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    [u] = [v]
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{document}

That one is fixed by the mathtools package.

Maybe something along the lines of the following, Mike :

\let \bgroup = { % Redundant; added solely for clarity

\def \mycommand {\futurelet \nexttoken \branchoncatcode}

\def \branchoncatcode
     {\ifcat \noexpand \nexttoken \noexpand \bgroup
         \let \next = \mycommandwithparameter
      \else
         \let \next = \mycommandwithoutparameter
      \fi
      \next
     }

\def \mycommandwithparameter #1{#1}
\def \mycommandwithoutparameter {\vskip 1 cm \relax}

% tests start here

\mycommand
\mycommand {Hello}
\mycommand
\mycommand {Goodbye}
\mycommand
\mycommand %
\end

sorry, must read

    \newcommand\mycommand[1][\vspace{1cm}]{#1}

I stopped proof-reading when Paul's answer made "bling".

What I told about \@ifnextchar is what Paul did in plain TeX.

And I had to type this correction a second time because my UMTS connection failed while sending.

Why do you want to have the same macro name for different purposes?

There are already many solutions in the thread:
* A classical optional argument:
  \newcommand*{\mycommand}[1][]{...}
* An optional argument using braces.

However optional arguments at the end have the risk of
misinterpretation:

\mycommand
{\bfseries Hello World} % group braces are taken as argument braces

\mycommand\xyz % missing argument braces


Another concept/idea:
In the example above the first use of \mycommand is in
vertical mode, the second in horizontal mode.
This can be used to make the macro behaving differently
dependend on the mode:

\makeatletter
\newcommand*{\mycommand}{%
  \ifhmode
    \expandafter\mycommand at hmode
  \else
    \ifvmode
      \mycommand at vmode
    \else
      \errmessage{Invalid mode}%
    \fi
  \fi
}
\newcommand*{\mycommand at hmode}[1]{#1}
\newcommand*{\mycommand at vmode}{\vspace{1cm}}

Yours sincerely

Subject: [texhax] Question about \aftergroup
Message-ID: <AANLkTinHff3+ouWGPJ9oLLrCmeujSmRakTGSHVBSCd4i@mail.gmail.com>

I have changed the definition of \normalcolor from color.sty so that it
works in RTL too:

\def\normalcolor{\let\current at color\default at color\ifhmode\if at RTL
\beginL\aftergroup\endR\fi\fi\set at color\ifhmode\if at RTL
\beginR\aftergroup\endL\fi\fi}

If I write anywhere \normalcolor, no problem appears.  I get and not
problem, if I use it inside a \vbox but if I use it inside an hbox such as
\hbox{\normalcolor This is a test.}, TeX complains that misiing \beginL or
\endL inserted, of course that can be solved by having \hbox{{\normalcolor
This is a test}} but I was wondering if anyone knows the cause of the
problem and if there is any good solution for it.

Likewise, it is not possible to use \beginL and \endL in mathmode as far as
I tested, but I need to change \normalcolor in math mode as well so that it
works for RTL text, any solution for this?

Thanks

Dear All,

I have just hit that task that every user of LaTeX fears - the
conversion of a document into MS Word format.  Has anyone had any luck
making tex4ht compatible with the endnotes package?  Footnotes work
very well with the tex4ht oolatex command, but endnotes result in
strange objects appearing in the text file.

Very best wishes,

Or

Lorem\newline % with extra space
[unreadable] ipsum

I know there are many issues with the TeX lexical analyzer and parser, and the extremely complex rules about spaces is one of them, but not ignoring space token would at least fix a small number space-related problems.

or maybe it's the *comment* character's fault!? 
It might be an *active* character, analyzing the situation ... 
or an *interactive* character, asking "are you trying to fool me?"

hm, more seriously: TeX offers many possibilities to the programmer, 
it's the latter's fault ...

(Ahm, in wiki.sty, http://ctan.org/pkg/nicetext, I have implemented 
 some analysis of "first tokens of an input line" to call 
 LaTeX list environments.)

Indeed, I originally used the occasion to express my anger 
about Leslie Lamport's choice of square brackets as 
"optional argument delimiters". 

Sometimes it has seemed to me that "angle brackets" 
would be the better "optional argument delimiters". 
I am thinking of ednotes, ArabTeX, PicTeX ...
But really, it depends on the document's subject matter ...

I really wondered if LaTeX3 could offer the choice to authors 
which should be the optional argument delimiters.

More generally (aiming at future TeXs), there really might be 
more *category codes*, so you could have 
(i) category codes for "optional argument delimiters"
(ii) category codes for "group delimiters", independently of 
"mandatory argument delimiters" 
(i.e., one certain character could work like \begingroup, 
 and another like \endgroup; and then think of \hbox\bgroup 
 vs. "\hbox{" ... "box content delimiters")

Less seriously, with *ternary* computers, we might have 
27 category codes instead of only 16 ...

Cheers, bling, 

    Uwe.

Is it possible to convert a ScientificWord document to a WinEdt document? If possible, please advise me how to do it. 
 
I have used ScientificWord software to produce a math document, but now wish to use WinEdt and continue my document in WinEdt before producing a PDF file. 
 
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

Sure it is possible. The LaTeX-kernel defines \input differently
depending on if a brace follows or not:

\def\input{\@ifnextchar\bgroup\@iinput\@@input}

You only need to copy this:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\begin{document}

\makeatletter
\def\mymacro{\@ifnextchar\bgroup\@mymacroi\@mymacroii}

\def\@mymacroi#1{BLA -- \textbf{#1} -- BLA }
\def\@mymacroii{blubb -- }

\mymacro \mymacro{abc}
\end{document}

ask SWP to save the file as 'portable LaTeX', then it is back to a 
'normal' LaTeX file (simply do a 'save as' and choose 'portable LaTeX' 
from the formats dropdown)

There may be a few packages left in the preamble that are not found in a 
standard LaTeX dist, but these can usually be removed without any problems

That is the "input" for TeX-related software addressing any TeX users. 

MiKTeX only is one "output stream" for distributing TeX-related software, 
drawing from CTAN.

You "contribute" -- they "distribute" -- :-)

Thanks in advance on behalf of the TeX users' community!
(... although nobody elected me to act on their behalf ...)

Sorry, but no distribution except MikTeX can do anything with *.exe
files. 

Even the source code isn't sufficient for TeX Live, someone has to
provide the nasty autoconf stuff in order to make it available to all
supported platforms.

If you want to provide software which is supposed to work on all TeX
systems, I strongly recommend texlua (luatex --luaonly) as a
programming language.  TeX Live provides a Perl engine, MikTeX
doesn't, so Perl scripts don't work out-of the-box under MikTeX.
LuaTeX is always present in modern TeX distributions.

Furthermore, texlua is fast, powerful, and easy to learn.  It's also
brilliantly documented.  There are excellent on-line resources and the
book about Lua[1] is certainly one of the best.

Anyway, I think that it's best to have Vinoth's program on CTAN though.

  Reinhard

Actually, 3^4=81.

But I don't think that we need more category codes.  The sole purpose
of them is to assign different meanings to one and the same character,
which is not desirable at all.

In this particular case, the problem is that curly braces are
ambiguous.  The only _reasonable_ solution is to provide two macros
with distinct, meaningful, names.  This makes the file more readable
to humans and allows other programs to parse the file.

Additional catcodes are not helpful.  You need them in order to
distinguish between

  \foo{optional argument}

and

  \foo{\large ordinary text}

But how should, for instance a text editor, distinguish between the
different meanings of curly braces in order to provide proper syntax
highlighting, if each occurrence of "{" has a different meaning?

Please note that I regard LaTeX more as a markup language rather than
a programming language.  LaTeX has a clear syntax, optional arguments
are in box brackets, not in curly braces.  I don't see any good reason
to break LaTeX's syntax rules deliberately.

I don't know whether DEK is still convinced that the invention of
catcodes was a good idea.  He avoided them in Metafont, at least.

  Reinhard

Message-ID: <4D1C660B.4080400@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I tried twice to send a mail to the MiKTeX-user list asking what the
meaning of "mik" was. But none of the mails showed up at the list (did
not come back to me and is not in the archives); I did not get any error
that the mail was rejected. First mail was sent on 11/09, the second one
on 12/26.
As I don't use miktex, I am actually not interested in the list, but
still want to know where the name comes from.
So I wanted to ask if someone who had already succeeded to get a mail on
that list could ask this question for me? I still hope that somewhere
out there someone does know the meaning of "MiK".
If the mail from someone normally able to write to that list would not
shop up, too, I'd think about some conspiracy theories around the most
secret name of MiKTeX 	;)

I'd really apreciate help here ? it seems that a lot of people want to
know this, too ;)

cheers
Arno

First, CTAN does store platform-dependent software, even for Windows. 
Fine for those who just look for something useful and download 
and install directly from CTAN.

Second, TeX Live is available for Windows as well,

    http://tug.org/texlive/

I do know people who work with TeX Live on Windows.

Third, what evidence do you have that other (historical) distributions 
containing *.exe are definitely dead? 

Kind of philosophical questions: 1. What if emTeX is unmaintained, 
but still used and perhaps even copied to more recent hardware?
(I know one Y&Y user.)
2. Are PCTeX etc. "distributions" or not?

    Uwe.

Yes, and 28/7=4 :-)

3^3 is beautiful, 3^4 is strange. 3^3 is sufficient, 
while the binary analogue 2^2 is not. 
2^4 turned out to be sufficient, 
but from a binary point of view it is not as beautiful 
as 3^3 is from the ternary point of view.

When I was at the Borough Polytechnic some forty years
ago, we were taught (by David Singmaster, he of Rubic's
cube fame) that the optima radix for computer operations
was the exponential e.  At that time, no-one had succeeded
in building such a computer : has that situation changed
since then, does anyone know ?

'''Everybody''' (may be except of you but I think that you just
pretend not to know) knows  what mik means but it is so offensive, so
indecent that '''nobody''' will ever tell you.

PS It is similar to term '''sepulka''' in the novel of famous Polish
scifi writer Stanislaw Lem. :-)

The author or Ant says something like that, but TeX and LaTeX 
progammers do assign different meanings to the same character, 
and I like it.

Apart from this, my idea to introduce new category codes for 
group delimiters and for box delimiters would imply that 
you could not use \hbox{...} and {\bfseries ...} and \emph{...} 
"at the same time", or it requires \catcode changing while 
processing document source, which really tends to make 
things difficult. 

But I proposed a non-TeX, of course you need different 
highlighting settings for different programs, and right 
now some editors offer different highlighting settings 
for different programming languages.

> I don't know whether DEK is still convinced that the invention of

In Metafont, there is no need to distinguish text from markup ...

In a package of mine, category codes make safe expandable 
emptyness tests (etc.) possible -- the input is read with \catcode`\$=12 
and in the testing macro with \ifx$#1$ uses a different \catcode`\$.

Similarly private characters in macros in general, such as with LaTeX.

Active characters can allow tayloring syntax for special purposes. 
It is difficult and can be very tedious to program, but without 
category codes this possibility just doesn't exist. 

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

We have presented examples before where present LaTeX syntax 
is not nice, and this still is my opinion.

A better proposal than using different category codes is 
programming macros with optional arguments obeying 
a convention that makes a choice of delimiters available to users.  
Any macro package replacing \@ifnextchar[ by some 
\ifx\let at token\opt at arg@delim could be run this way. 

If no LaTeXY will adopt this, I will call it L?TeX :-)

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Arno is not alone : I have no idea what "Mik" means,
nor have I the faintest idea what a sepulka might be.

On the other hand, when asked "Why is a mouse when it spins ?",
I can answer "because the higher, the fewer" with complete confidence.

And as I can confidently state from a near lifetime's
experience, "tayloring" syntax is at the very heart
of creative programming.

There is even an article in Polish wikipedia about sepulka:

I understand that in some parallel universes this is indeed the case.
Odd that it should not be true for this one.

"I saw a man upon the stair
  I looked again, he was not there
  He was not there again today :
  I /wish/ that man would go away !"

Serious question, particularly aimed at Robin Fairbairns
and others of his age/nationality :

When I was a child, my father would recite to me :

"As I was going through Jungle Jaini, Jungle Jaini Jaini-eye
  I thought I saw a jahocrapot, a-chasing his compaini-eye
  And so I took my ti-de-ma-tuc, my ti-de-ma-tuc, my taini-eye
  And I potted that jahocrapot, a-right through his compaini-eye"

yet as far as I can tell, that otherwise source of infinite resource
and sagacity the Internet has not heard of any one of these nonsense
terms : has anyone else ?

Active characters also allow tailoring syntax, 
while this doesn't look impressive to me. 
It may still be sufficient for many purposes, 
but I wonder if you, Phil, agree that it 
suffices for creative programming.

Sorry, Uwe, although there was an element of seriousness
in my response, the greater part was pure seasonal frivolity :
you wrote of "TAYLORing syntax", and I responded as someone
(Philip TAYLOR) who has done that for all of his professional life :-)

Of course, and therefore I thought only you can 
give a reliable account of the power of tailoring 
as compared to the power of tayloring.

Never mind,

TeX Live is supposed to work on all systems which are in use today.
Unfortunately, the Windows part was maintained separately in the past
and not all features were available on Windows.  In 2007/08 we worked
very hard in order to close this gap.  If you have TL 2008 or newer,
you'll hopefully don't notice many differences anymore between
different platforms.

It's not impossible to add software which works on a particular system
only.  But in order to avoid opening the gap again, platform-independent
software is preferred.

Regards,
  Reinhard

We had a related requirement -- how to produce two different
versions of a book from the same source files.  We tried
(La)TeX-specific approaches but abandoned these because the
syntax was too messy and it was too hard (for us at least)
to make sure that the conditional code was handled
correctly, and not changed by the if/else mechanism and that
we wouldn't have to worry about when expressions were
evaluated, escaped, etc.

So instead we pre-process the LaTeX files:

- source file is, say, simple.texpp
  (where 'pp' stands for 'preprocessor').

- use 'unifdef' to handle the conditionals.  unifdef is
  very basic which is great -- it leaves just about
  everything completely untouched apart from handling
  if/else.  Here's an example:

	\documentclass[12pt]{article}
	\begin{document}

	First

	#ifdef MME

	Second

	Third

	#else

	Fourth

	Fifth

	#endif

	Sixth

	\end{document}

  If we are producing the "mass market edition" (MME) we get
  one output tex file; on the other hand if MME is undefined we get a
  different variant -- the "normal" version of the book.

  We send the output of unifdef to simple.tex in this
  example, which we then process as normal.

- A full example, with Makefile, is at

	http://uit.co.uk/files/tex-and-latex/unifdef-example.tgz

  (size is 0.5K).

	Regards,
	Niall

Thanks for your comment, but that is a quite different problem. I tried
to unify everything into a single LaTeX run ? that was the problem. Two
different versions wouldn't have been a problem as the file is quite
short and working with conditionals would have been fine.

But as I am planning to produce two very different versions of my
thesis, I might get back to your approach ;)

cheers
Arno

I had thought of posting such a "feature request" earlier, 
refrained from it for not having found a good idea how 
to implement it. If I now found it so simple, I must have 
overlooked a problem ...

This would mean that so many \foo in the LaTeX kernel 
reading their optional argument by \@foo[#1] must be replaced.

At least I have now thought how such macros would have to 
look like instead (sketch, \SetOptArgDels chooses delimiters, 
\foo is an example command with one optional argument):

    \def\SetOptArgDels#1#2{%
        \let\opt at arg@del at l#1%
        \def\read at pass@opt at arg##1#1##2#2{##1{##2}}}
    \def\foo{%
        \@ifnextchar\opt at arg@del at l
            {\read at pass@opt at arg\@foo}%
            {\@foo{DEFAULT}}}
    \def\@foo#1...

-- where one had \def\@foo[#1]... so far.

Maybe this already is in xparse? Sorry, I cannot afford more right now ...

Fortunately, 

1. there would be no need to change preamble-only commands, 

2. as I realize at reading Heiko's comment, the "ambiguity" only 
arises with macros whose *last* (e.g., only) arguments are optional.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

No, but it sounds related to something I can only remember in patches:

As I went on my ???????????????, on Monday morning early,
I saw one Mr. Higmajig, come over the hills of parley,
But if I'd had my carley fairley carly fairley early
I would have been met with Higmajig come over the hills of parley.

(Google knoweth not)

On a slightly more serious (??) note--Does anyone reading this recognize
and know the source of...

"The sun rolls glibly, a great gilded hearse,
The moon wobbles and gibbers like Juliet's nurse."

I think I saw it in a Listener (BBC) some time in the late 50s or early 
60s, and
I have searched desultorily for it for many years since.

What is sfmn1400 and where does it come from?

The first two letters indicate that you are using cm-super fonts, but
there is neither sfmm1400 or sfmn1400 in TeX Live or on CTAN.

Please provide a minimal example which demonstrates the problem.

Regards,
  Reinhard

But how was this file created?

missfont.log files are usually created when Metafont fails.  This can
happen if you say, for instance,

\font\x=sfmn1400

and Metafont can't create TFM or PK files from sfmn1400.mf, either
because it's buggy or it doesn't exist.

The cm-super fonts are Type1 replacements for fonts which were only
available as bitmaps at this time, and there are no TFM files for
cm-super.  Thus, you can't use them with TeX at all.

What you have to do in order to use them is to provide a map file
entry for dvips.  For \font\rm=ecrm1000 you need an entry like this:

ecrm1000 SFRM1000 "T1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <cm-super-t1.enc <sfrm1000.pfb

TeX is using ecrm1000.tfm in order to create a DVI file and nothing
else but ecrm1000 is mentioned in the DVI file.  dvips would normally
call Metafont in order to create ecrm1000.pk, but because there is an
entry for ecrm1000 in psfonts.map, dvips uses the PFB file instead of
calling Metafont.

There are no TFM files for cm-super, hence TeX isn't aware of them.
How do fontnames beginning with "sf" go into a DVI file, then? 
Why should any program try to create bitmaps for "sf*" fonts?

I fear that I can't provide more information unless I can reproduce
the problem here.

  Reinhard

Dear BBC,

likewise, thinking of the saylors landing at Pevensey 1066, 
in a German newspaper I read an anecdote about the first 
physical contact of William the Conqueror with England. 
I wonder whether the British historians amongst you agree 
on the story how William saved the morale of the saylors. 
Something like "One too small step for a man" ...

Thanks, 

    Uwe.
