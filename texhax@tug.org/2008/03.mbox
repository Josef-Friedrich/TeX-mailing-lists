Go to

http://www.tug.org/begin.html

and about the middle of the page look for

The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e

After a couple of clicks, you'll be able to download

http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf

You will find there the answer to your question and a lot more.


If I advised you to go first to http://www.tug.org/begin.html is  
because you'll find more information there that you might need later.


Happy TeXing!

Add the following line where you want to put your Table of Contents. I
assume that you are using LaTeX.

I need to put text in a parbox using an environment. I have defined the environment mybox to do this and tried to use it in my document as shown below:

 

\newenvironment{mybox}{%

  \parbox{5cm}{% \parbox text opening brace

}%

{ }% \parbox text closing brace

}

 

\begin{document}

 

\begin{mybox}

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

\end{mybox}

 

\end{document}

 

 

However, the text is not placed in a parbox. The output which I need is that given by the following code:

 

\begin{document}

 

\parbox{5cm}{

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

}

 

\end{document} 

 

 

Thanks

 

Mark

Thanks for your reply but what if I need something like this

\newenvironment{mybox}{%
  \textbf {% \textbf opening brace
}%
{ }% \textbf closing brace
}

\begin{mybox}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
\end{mybox}

The text will not be in bold. Now, I know that I can use \bfseries instead of \textbf but I need a solution for any command which does not have a corresponding environment.

Thanks.

your question has already been answered on comp.text.tex, the 
environment equivalent to \parbox is the minipage environment

Hi,

You can use \bgroup and \egroup instead:

\documentclass{article}
\newenvironment{myboldbox}{%
   \begin{minipage}{5cm}\textbf\bgroup}{%
   \egroup\end{minipage}}
\begin{document}
\begin{myboldbox}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do  
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim  
ad minim ...
\end{myboldbox}
\end{document}

You would only have to do this if the command you wanted to use had  
no declaration alternative, like \bfseries for \textbf.

HTH,
Matt

Dear friends,

The BachoTeX 2008 Program Committee dares to remind you of the quickly
upcoming deadline for submitting paper proposals for the BachoTeX 2008
conference. The Call for Papers and TeX Pearls can be found
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2008/cfp1en.

We trust that the main theme of the conference, ,,TeX contra TeX''
should be of a great interest to the community at large and the
various developers in particular.

You may have noted that the supplementing theme "Aesthetic aspects
of typesetting" is also addressed to those who use other typesetting
software. If you know people active in this area please talk them
into presenting a paper.

Your children or very young TeXies in your vicinity are invited to
contribute in the yet another conference supplementing theme "What
is TeX to me?"

Based on suggestions and experiences form previous years, one day of
the conference will be devoted solely to working meetings of the
various informal interest groups (no presentations):
- fonts,
- TeX engines,
- distributions,
- supporting software,
- typesetting software in general,
- propagating TeX,
- history of TeX
-- you name it. Talk your common interest buddies into coming and/or
propose a paper.

Do not forget submitting your "TeX Pearls" aka "TeX beauties and
oddities"!

And, finally -- registration is open at
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2008/registration-en. Please note
that early registration ending March 31 allows for a significant
saving in the conference fee.

Come and celebrate the XVIth, or $10000_{2}$  or $100_{4}$ or
$20_{8}$ or $10_{16}$ BachoTeX!

Hi!
My name is S?lvia Roque and I am writing a thesis in Mathematics, using Latex at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Coimbra, Portugal.
But I have small problem. My both supervisors (one from physics, other from mathematics), want me to change the chapter numbers: They want me to call chapter 0 to chapter ?Introduction?.
The problem is that I am using a ?\documentclass[a4paper,11pt, oneside]{book}?, and it seems that on a document book, Latex allays calls to the first chapter, chapter 1.
Is it possible to change this? I am asking this because I already know that it is possible to change the numbering pages of the document (for example, to put roman numbering on the first chapter and Arabic numbering on the others chapters.)
  
 Sincerely yours, S?lvia Roque

I think you can get what you want with \chapter*{Introduction}, which
creates an un-numbered chapter.

that was an odd request normally one uses an unnumbered introduction, 
which is normally (depending on the class used) is handled by

\frontmatter

introductionary information, ToC etc.

\mainmatter

the actual content of the thesis

Ask them if that is acceptable, it not

\setcounter{chapter}{-1}
\chapter{Introduction}


might help

Folks,

I hope this is a trivial question.
I'm new to LaTex fonts for anything but the default (computer modern).

I'd like to use one font, say palatino, for roman text;
but I'd like to use another font, say helvetica bold, for small caps.

Can I set those for an entire document,
such that I can switch between \normaltext and \scshape
without a full NFSS font specification each time?

Thx, Doug McAllaster

Yes, but one wonders what you're trying to achieve and why.

Look at the fontinst docs for one aspect of the solution, and Philip  
Lehman's wonderful font installation tutorial for a full description.

I believe we could better assist you if you described why you need  
this sort of thing.

Or maybe they adhere to the convention that front matter 
does not count for certain purposes (e.g arabic page numbering) and 
they include the introduction in the front matter?

Then it would be logical to start at Chapter 1 after the 
Introduction.

If you wanted the Introduction to be numbered along with the "main matter"
i.e. the bulk of the book, you could use:

\chapter*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}
Introduction text...

\chapter{First Chapter}
...

That way, the Introduction isn't numbered, but still shows up in the table
of contents. If you wanted to start the chapter number at 2 instead of 1
(like Introduction, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, ...) insert
\setcounter{chapter}{1} anywhere before the first un-starred \chapter{}. You
can, of course, do whatever you want with page numbers by using
\setcounter{page} and \pagenumbering{roman} or \pagenumbering{arabic}, but
you generally want to minimize using these types of commands in the interest
of separating content from formatting.

Regardless, it sounds like \setcounter{counter}{value}, \chapter*{}, and
\pagenumbering{style} will fix your problem.

Cheers,
Robert Wilson

Use

\chapter*{Introduction}

This suppresses numbering, which for chapters includes suppressing the 
automatically generated text "Chapter" as well as the number. The 
chapter counter is not incremented either, so numbering will start from 
1 at the first (non-starred) \chapter command, which is what you want.

Message-ID: <2021FEB4-C333-4F35-B900-15873E480C86@rwth-aachen.de>

Hello there,

creating a pdf-file with LaTeX, I'm trying to use the \href{} command  
to link to a german wikipedia article (the english pendant is http:// 
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroglossum_stellatarum).
I use the command as follows:

#code

\href{http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taubenschw?nzchen}{http:// 
de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taubenschw?nzchen}

#/code

I think, the hyperref-package denies the use of german "Umlaute" such  
as ? in URLs, but how can I refer to that page? The generated  
hyperlink-address is this:

#code

http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taubenschw\protect\unhbox\voidb at x\bgroup 
\U at D1ex{\setbox\
z@\hbox{\char127}\dimen at - .45ex\advance\dimen@\ht\z@}\accent127 
\fontdimen5\font\U at Da\
egroupnzchen

#/code

Is there any possibility to realize that?

Thanks for your help!

Best regards,
Lars.

It's not the hyperref package which causes trouble.  Your link works
fine for me.

Look at the code above carefully.  You are using a 7 bit font which
doesn't contain an "?".  Instead, it uses \accent in order to put the
dots over the "a".  You cannot search for words containing accented
characters in Acroread either unless you have have real accented
characters. 

 > Is there any possibility to realize that?

I suppose that you are using Computer Modern, TeX's default font.
Then it's sufficient to put \usepackage{lmodern} into the preamble.
The Latin Modern fonts contain about 1200 real characters, supporting
nearly all latin languages without combining characters by macros.

Dear Lars,

On my machine if I go to that URL it's rewritten to a more ASCII- 
friendly

     http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taubenschw%C3%A4nzchen

So you can use that as the destination of your hyperlink:

     \href{http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taubenschw%C3%A4nzchen}
	 {http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taubenschw\"anzchen}

The % will be interpreted the "right" way (i.e., not as TeX comments)  
by TeX but maybe not your text editor's syntax coloring mechanism.   
So that's kind of annoying.  But it does create a link to the place  
you want to go, with a URL written the way you want to see it.

Incidentally, if you want to insert a clickable URL into your  
document, often times all you need is the url package.  Then

     \url{http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptseite}

will create a link with destination URL and link text equal to the  
same thing.  It also sets the URL text in monospace font, underlined,  
so it looks clickable.  It even interprets ~, _ and other characters  
correctly so they're not converted to nonbreaking spaces and subscripts.

It doesn't seem to help with your umlauts, but I think that's the  
fault of LaTeX for not wanting non-ASCII characters.  XeTeX is  
designed to work with unicode, but I don't know if you want to switch  
your TeX program just to get some URLs quicker. :-)

Gr??e aus der Vereinigten Staaten,
Matt

Hi Thomas,

All the information you should need to process your TeX files can be  
found at http://tug.org.

I would suggest you get a copy of the TeXLive installation for easy  
set up and running. You can get it from http://tug.org/texlive/ This  
will contains the necessary software for processing your files plus  
tools for editing it. If however you want to convert the tex files to  
rtf you can use latex2rtf from http://latex2rtf.sourceforge.net/

To be honest though, I do not think that MS Word is the right tool to  
be using for writing and publishing software documentation, let alone  
documentation that is voluminous. On Windows the choices I would  
recommend would be either LaTeX, TeX (as above) or FrameMaker from http://www.adobe.com/products/framemaker/

HIH

I've installed TeXLive in Mac OS and Linux, but for Windows I think  
proTeXt

http://www.tug.org/protext/

is really easier. Also, as it is based on MikTeX

http://www.miktex.org/

you get frequent updates via MikTeX updater.

Talking about commercial products, there is also Scientific Word/

While there are (La)TeX -> Word .doc/.rtf conversion tools, I'd agree  
w/ Alan and Axel that you _don't_ want to run them.

If the files are fairly standard LaTeX, probably the best route would  
be to install LyX (http://www.lyx.org) which on Windows will also get  
you MikTeX. LyX is a visual / interactive editor which in many ways is  
_much_ better than Word and almost certainly better suited and more  
stable for the task in question.

If the files aren't standard LaTeX, then the conversion tools won't  
work well and you'll need to achieve an understanding of how the  
macros &c. in them function and how to map them to similar functions  
in some other tool (I'd suggest FrameMaker instead of Word if you're  
desperate to stay w/ Windows and a fully commercial tool, but if  
you'll give up the desire for commercial support you'd be much happier  
w/ LyX, certainly the mapping of macros into a customized .layout file  
will be much cleaner and the output will much more easily match what  
you had before).

It is possible that there is no suitable LaTeX processor because you 
have (plain) TeX source. New LaTeX processors are used to going into 
compatibility mode - for older LaTeX sources. This is automatic. So 
If you've tried a new LaTeX and it does not work at all, try a  plain 
TeX instead.

If neither works for you, we readers of this texhax list might offer 
more relevant help  if we could see what you tried, and why you 
thought it failed.

The top few lines of your source and what tool you fed it to would be 
useful too.  And/or perhaps you could post the log file(s) with the 
errors in it?

>From the what I know so far, the  cheapest solution  will be to use 
TeX family software to process your source to a pdf.  (e.g. Lyx, 
Winedt  with TeXlive, MikTeX etc as suggested). This rule of thumb 
will weaken as you choose to make your changes to the documentation 
more extensive.  Clearly, by the time you choose to have a rewrite of 
the content, and a radically different format, there's nothing left 
to re-use in your sources. You may then choose whatever publishing 
system suits you and the task.   And your choice will depend on 
whether you already have  expertise in a (sufficiently) appropriate 
publishing system. if none, LaTeX & ConTeXt are worth considering 
again.  I advise against Word for voluminous documentation. It's not 
sold as or designed for producing long or complex documents. From my 
own experience Word  2000 can't cope with 30 pages of publisher's 
catalogue (too complex), and 500 pages of doctoral thesis (mostly 
running  text) will start to break features.  TeX is noted for its 
good support of long documents, robustness when providing complex 
features and especially for its support of mathematical notation.

I believe that any conversion  to Word  that you try  will be only 
partly automatic, error prone (both manual and automatic aspects) and 
may not adhere to the formatting conventions you demand.  You should 
do better with conversion to XML/SGML. That probably won't be 
painless either.

If, as it seems, you no longer have TeX/LaTeX expertise in-house, you 
may prefer to hire someone rather than process the source in house at 
the expense of your  time. TeX consultants are findable. Your local 
TeX user group could perhaps advise on someone local. 

Of course I'd warmly encourage you to  learn TeX/LaTeX, especially if 
the budget is really tight, but it _is time consuming. I think it's 
fair to say plain TeX has a steep learning curve, and LaTeX a 
somewhat shallower one.   Which brings us back to deciding whether 
you have plain TeX or LaTeX source.

I hope these hints move you further forward.

Hi,

  I am a PhD student in Nanyang Technological University from Jan 2007.
I am interested in  Latex and recently I was trying to learn how to draw
plots in Latex using pstrics.  Although I have installed the 'pstrics'
package it's not working. It shows the error message 'undefined control
sequence'. I will be greatly obliged and grateful  if you please give me
a suggestion how to overcome this problem. It may be mentioned that in
my PC operating system is Windows Vista.

 

Thank you.

Hi Aniruddha,

It would be helpful if you could provide more information, such as  
what file are you trying to process and how are you calling it?

undefined control sequence' is a fairly generic kind of error and  
really points to anything the program doesn't understand that you have  
put in your file. Perhaps you could post the parts of the log in which  
the error was reported.

Cheers
Alan

Try Pgf/TikZ latest version , which is more powerful
and very useful.

	LModern text
Message-ID: <001c01c88160$d5eb99d0$0200000a@flaptop>

Hi all,

I'm getting near to the end of my book and I'm pleased with the results
using Latin Modern. 

One of the few things left to do is to choose a font for the section and
chapter headings. Has anyone got any suggestions? I think Latin Modern
when blown up to heading size looks, well, a bit much. I wanted
something a bit different, a bit more progressive, maybe. I guess I'm
searching for the right words because I don't quite know what I want.

Bear in mind that the font chosen for the section and chapter headings
will also be used for the book title at the start of the book and also
eventually the cover.

Await your comments with interest...

Kind regards,

James

Hi Matthew,
 Thanks a lot for your suggestion. You are right. I was trying to run
pdfLaTeX on this file. However, later on I tried to use PGF and TikZ for
graphics in LaTeX which is working fine.

Thanks and regards,

Dear Aniruddha,

I had suggested you post the example to the texhax list, not to me  
personally, so as many people can see it.  There are quite a few  
experts on the list, I was just letting you know about the customs.

But any way, here is the error message I got:

! Undefined control sequence.
<recently read> \c at lor@to at ps

l.14 \psdots(
              0,0)(2,0)(1,1)

I think you are trying to run pdflatex on this file, and pstricks  
isn't compatible with pdflatex (regular latex produced DVI, which can  
be converted to PostScript, and this is where pstricks does its  
tricks).  When I ran regular latex it compiled without error and  
produced what you wanted.

PGF and TikZ is a basically an implementation of pstricks in pdf(la) 
tex, so maybe you want to check that out.  I use it all the time and  
it's great.

Enjoy!

Indeed, preview works for me!

The preview doc is difficult but did get
me enough info to produce the following
Makefile fragments... the pdf target
required some scripting to make separate
pdf files, there may be a better way...


multi :
	$(MAKE) clean
	latex '\PassOptionsToPackage{active,delayed,tightpage,displaymath,floats,textmath,graphics}{preview} \input{$@}'
	$(MAKE) png pdf file=$@
pdf :
	dvips -i -o ${file}.ps. ${file}
	for n in ${file}.ps.* ; do gs -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=$$n.pdf $$n ; rm $$n ; printf $$n"\t" ; done ; echo
png :
	dvips -o ${file}.ps ${file}
	gs -sDEVICE=png16m -dTextAlphaBits=4 -r300 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 -dSAFER -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=${file}-\%d.png ${file}.ps
eps :
	dvips -o ${file}.ps ${file}
	gs -sDEVICE=epswrite -r2400 -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=${file}-\%d.eps ${file}.ps
clean :
	find . -type f \( -name \*.ttt -o -name \*.fff -o -name \*.lof -o -name \*.lot \) -exec rm \{\} \;
	find . -type f \( -name \*.aux -o -name \*.log -o -name \*.toc -o -name \*.out -o -name \*.idx \) -exec rm \{\} \;
	find . -type f \( -name \*.pdf -o -name \*.png -o -name \*.dvi -o -name \*.eps -o -name \*.ps  \) -exec rm \{\} \;


It is unfortunate that \usepackage{preview}
cannot be passed by the \PassOptionsToPackage
convention above. The only problem with this
method is some formula come out as multiple
images when one would be preferred... eg

\documentclass{amsart}
\usepackage[active,tightpage,displaymath,textmath,showlables,floats,graphics]{preview}
\begin{document}

\ $\binom{n}{x_1\  x_2\ \ldots x_n} \prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{x_i}$\\
\ $sum_{i=1}^n x_i = n ; 0 < p_i < 1i ; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1$

\end{document}

For above, pdflatex generates two pages.
The following is one page but has two
undesirable side effects.

\begin{table}
\begin{centering}
\ $\binom{n}{x_1\  x_2\ \ldots x_n} \prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{x_i}$\\
\ $sum_{i=1}^n x_i = n ; 0 < p_i < 1i ; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1$\\
\end{centering}
\end{table}

That produces floats and the preview image
is the width of the page; neither of which
are desired. Is there some way to group
these lines into one "preview" "tightpage"
image?

pdfcrop does a nice job, with the example from my other
followup post... but the method requires a file per
image for capture.  Which might be worth developing an
application around.

It would make sense if the resulting cropped pdf image
where included in latex docs, like with \includegraphics
...reasonable solution accept the requirement for users
to externalize each formula in a file AND compile them
with Makefile targets is a little daunting, when the
expected solution is a latex template for "typeset" from

\documentclass{amsart}


\documentclass{amsart}
\usepackage{amssymb}
%\usepackage{fancyhdr}
%\pagestyle{fancy}
%\fancyfoot{}
\pagestyle{empty} % doesn't seem to remove page numbers in amsart
\begin{document}

\begin{centering}
\ $\binom{n}{x_1\  x_2\ \ldots x_n} \prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{x_i}$\\
\ $sum_{i=1}^n x_i = n s  0 < p_i < 1i ; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1$\\
\end{centering}

\end{document}


So, I cannot remove the page number *sigh*

not true.

however, you have to use both \pagestyle{empty}
and, on the first page,
  \thispagestyle{empty}
since the headers are different on the first
page.  also, these need to be specified *after*
\begin{document}

    \documentclass{amsart}
    \usepackage{amssymb}
    %\usepackage{fancyhdr}
    %\pagestyle{fancy}
    %\fancyfoot{}
    \pagestyle{empty} % doesn't seem to remove page numbers in amsart

    \end{centering}
    
    \end{document}

    -- 
    George Georgalis, information system scientist <IXOYE><

since you're using amsart, why not this:

  \begin{gather}
    \binom{n}{x_1\  x_2\ \ldots x_n} \prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{x_i}\\
    sum_{i=1}^n x_i = n s  0 < p_i < 1i ; \sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1
  \end{gather}

then you don't even need centering.

Well, actually pdfcrop will crop individual pages of a multipage pdf
(and it crops them individually, NOT all to the same size). Then, for
example,

pdftk <file-crop.pdf> burst

will split the result into individual pdf files, numbered sequentially.
I'm not sure what you want to start with, namely just the latex source
of the equations, say, or a real latex document from which you want to
spawn equations or whatever. If the latter, you could define a new
outfile and get your latex source to write out a latex file which you
then process via a shell script of some kind. And if you kept track of
each \newpage in your outfile you'd also know the number pdftk would
assign to the result and could reference it in some other document.

I'll stop here because (a) I'm getting over my depth and (b) as I noted
above, I'm not sure what you want as a starting point and what you want
as an end point. I also don't use TexShop.

Big big help, thanks.

Here's a rather convoluted, but complete demonstration
of all I got worked out (multiple, tightpage, multi-line
equations with gather, extracted with preview to eps and
also to pdf/png with pdfcrop), the Makefile fragment:

	latex '\PassOptionsToPackage{active,delayed,tightpage,displaymath,floats,textmath,graphics}{preview} \input{$@}' >/dev/null
	dvips -q -o $@.ps $@
	gs -q -sDEVICE=epswrite -r2400 -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=$@-\%d.eps $@.ps
	dvips -q -i -o $@.ps. $@
	for n in $@.ps.* ; do \
		gs -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=$$n.pdf $$n ; \
		pdfcrop $$n.pdf >/dev/null && mv $$n-crop.pdf $$n.pdf ; \
		gs -q -sDEVICE=png16m -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -r300 -sOutputFile=$$n.png $$n.pdf ; \
		rm $$n ; printf $$(expr $$n : 'multi.ps\(.*\)') ; done ; echo

where file $@ is

\documentclass{amsart}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\pagestyle{empty}
\usepackage{preview}
\begin{document}
\thispagestyle{empty}

\begin{gather*}
\binom{n}{x_1\  x_2\ aaa \ldots x_n} \prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{x_i}\\
\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = naaa
\qquad 0 < p_i < 1iaaa
\qquad \sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1aaa
\end{gather*}

\begin{gather*}
\binom{n}{x_1\  x_2\ \ldots x_n} \prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{x_i}\\
\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = n
\qquad 0 < p_i < 1i
\qquad \sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1
\end{gather*}

\end{document}

...that produces everything I can imagine I'll use about this!

TexShop is a nice mac GUI that integrates a basic
(w/ syntax highlighting) editor, pdf viewer, pdflatex
(command-t, "typeset") and a message/warning/error
window. Supports external editor and is a nice
application for developing tex files on mac.

Dears sirs/ladies,

 

I have installed MiKTex and TeXnicCenter according to instructions in the
Protext Manual. However, I am not able to configure TeXnicCenter. The system
does not accept the paths suggested by the Manual. Nor does it accept any of
the directory paths I am suggesting. The error message reads; "The
application "Latex" has not been found in the directory of your

A PDF file with tiny formula pages can also be generated directly by
pdflatex, as this rough example shows (ugly mix of plain TeX and LaTeX,
sorry, and too many parameters to reset):

Maybe I won't be of much help, because my platform is not Windows --- 
I just have MikTeX and TeXnicCenter in a virtual machine.

I just tried, though, and TeXnicCenter is working fine.

Under Built -> Define Output Profiles... I have, for LaTeX => DVI

C:\Program Files\MikTeX 2.7\miktex\bin\latex.exe

Can you provide more information about your setup?

Message-ID: <E12B42F5-B0D5-4950-8243-B3C26D32B46C@tufts.edu>

Is there a way to create a macro which can be used inside a pspicture  
environment which calls pstricks macros but calculates some  
parameters from its arguments?

I am trying to create a macro to draw a figure which includes an  
elliptic arc whose beginning and ending angles are computed from the  
arguments of the macro.  But it seems I cannot do something like
	\ellipticarc(0,0)(0.5,1){180 45 sub}{180 45 add}
(never mind substituting #1 or #2 for the "45" above)---I get an  
error message:
	bad number: '180 45 sub' . 0 substituted.

Is there a way in postscript to name a number, compute its value, and  
then use it as a parameter
in a drawing command?

or simply search Windows for the file latex.exe, and note which directory 
it is located in. Then tell the TeXnicCenter wizard that path (navigate to 
it).

If latex.exe is not found, well then you have no LaTeX installed ;-)

Message-ID: <ABE84D344FE3C64D9A0158F538EA6CBF01D1A8A6@TSUVEMAIL.tristate.edu>

I have read the fancyhdr documentation. I have read the section on LaTeX marks and the section on the fancyhdr package in The LaTeX Companion. According to both sources, the code below should work?.?.?.?if I were using the article documentclass. (It does, indeed, work with the article documentclass, but not with amsart.)

I'd would greatly appreciate it if someone could tell me why the tex file below does not put the section number and title as the left side of the header. The left header is blank, no matter whether I use \markboth, \markright, or \markleft when re-defining the sectionmark. (I've tried using \rightmark in \lhead{?.?.?.?} when sectionmark is re-defined with either \markboth or \markright, but no matter what I do, the left header is blank.)

Is this a peculiarity of the amsart documentclass? (I've never had this kind of trouble with the book class or amsbook class.)

I'm not sure what you're asking.  But if you're asking how to make lists 
like the one you illustrate in your second paragraph, use the shortlst 
package --- and the runenumerate environment supported by it.

Gentlemen,

Thanks very much for your efforts to teach an ignorant swede how to install
LaTex. However, now I?ve found what I really was looking for, a
math-handling program, fully integrated with Microsoft Word. As you surely
understand I?m talking about Aurora. Against all odds, this program works
perfectly also in my hands and on my computer and will probably cover all my
needs. The price for Aurora, $43, is negligible. (This is no ad if you
thought so!)

Thanks again. Perhaps I will find a reason to torment you with further
LaTex-related questions in the future. Watch out!

Bye for now,

Ulf

or simply search Windows for the file latex.exe, and note which directory 
it is located in. Then tell the TeXnicCenter wizard that path (navigate to 
it).

If latex.exe is not found, well then you have no LaTeX installed ;-)

Thanks, Joan and Lars. Next time I'll ask more
specifically, which package is it :) Your input is
helpful. Indeed, there are several packages I found
interesting.

paralist, with inparaenum does just what I was looking for.

shortlist has nice features (shortitemize), and it's
nice and simple.  Not sure if runenumerate supports the
numbering style I need (as my example), but probably.

This review led me to enumitem, which I'll find handy in
the future too.

Thanks!

// George

Well ---TeX (and LaTeX and ConTeXt) is about more than math  
typesetting ---it's about the best typesetting system in general, not  
surpassed even today by professional typesetting applications as  
InDesign and QuarkXPress.

You could try also TeX-based applications as LyX:

http://www.lyx.org/ or TeXmacs:

http://www.texmacs.org/

Also, there are commercial products, as Publicon:

http://www.wolfram.com/products/publicon/index.html

or the more expensive Scientific Word/Workplace:

http://www.mackichan.com/

Hello,

I have a large document with various chapters and lot of figures, which are only
separated by a larger space in \listoffigures. I would like to add chapter
headings in the \listoffigures so that listoffigures separates the images of
one chapter.

So far I tried to find any relevant documents concerning this issue but without
success. If somebody could provide links or ideas how to solve this problem, I
would be very grateful.

After the first \chapter{First chap.} declaration you can add

\addtocontents{lof}{\centerline{\scshape Chapter I}}%
\addtocontents{lof}{\protect\vspace{1\baselineskip}}%

after the second \chapter{Second chap.},

\addtocontents{lof}{\protect\vspace{2\baselineskip}}%
\addtocontents{lof}{\centerline{\scshape Chapter II}}%
\addtocontents{lof}{\protect\vspace{1\baselineskip}}%

and so on. Change \vspace to suit your design, as well as the  
\scshape, to whatever you wish.


Best,

Axel

Message-ID: <200803172340.m2HNeWK06553@f7.net>

TUG has been accepted as a mentoring organization for Google's Summer of
Code 2008, so thanks to Google.
http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/03/meet-your-mentors.html
provides some background and next steps.

If you are a TeX developer and have an idea for your package or program
that could be usefully implemented by a student working full-time over
the summer, and are (hopefully) willing to mentor the project, please
email summer-of-code at tug.org with the details.  See http://tug.org/gsoc/
for the ideas we've posted so far.

You can also offer to mentor a package without specific projects in
mind -- many students submit ideas of their own.  Again, just let us
know.

If you are a student or know a student who might like to participate,
please consider submitting an idea from the list, or one of your own.
Early applications inevitably get more attention than later ones, so the
sooner the better.

Anyone is welcome to subscribe or post to our organizational SoC mailing
list: http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/summer-of-code.

Thanks,
Karl

Subject: [texhax] Kubuntu Greek PS font?
Message-ID: <47E03240.1040604@gmail.com>

I am running Kubuntu gutsy amd64, which comes with texlive.

A long, long time ago I created a TeX document that contained a smattering
of Greek words. In those days, one would generate bitmapped characters from
MF sources: painful, but at least it worked OK for producing DVI output.

Fast forward to now... and I need to do something similar, but with the
output being PDF. For the main text of the document I am using the Latin
Modern fonts. As far as I can tell, the LM project does not include glyphs
for typesetting Greek language (maybe I'm worng, but I couldn't find any
reference to typesetting Greek with LM, and the very name "Latin" suggests
that it does not contain such glyphs). So what would people suggest I use
in order to be able to create a PDF with properly-scalable Greek characters?

(I expect that this is easy; but I still live in the world of TeX from 15
years ago, and I have a hard time figuring out which of the stuff I know is
now hopelessly outdated and which is still correct, with the result that I
probably find this all quite a bit harder than would a complete neophyte.)

    in order to be able to create a PDF with properly-scalable Greek
    characters?

http://ctan.org/fonts/greek/cbfonts has the Greek fonts as outlines.  A
decent modern TeX installation will have this already installed.
Whether Kubuntu gutsy bothered to include it, I cannot say.  It is part
of the original TeX Live.

You are right that Greek is not part of Latin Modern at present.

Subject: [texhax] Vertical spacing between theorems
Message-ID: <000001c88a05$5da05f80$0300000a@flaptop>

Hey,

I have my exercise package now which gives me a simple environment for
exercises. It squirrels away the answers in a \newbox to be recalled all
at once with an \unvbox at some later stage (some may remember that I
found the mysterious \bgroup and \egroup commands to achieve this after
hacking another exercise package, together with an indecent amount of
swearing at the screen one evening).

So I now have my exercises but the vertical space between them remains a
problem. I've had a look at the amsthm package and found these lines...

+++

\newskip\theorempreskipamount
\newskip\theorempostskipamount
\global\setlength\theorempreskipamount{12pt plus 5pt minus 3pt}

...which I've added to my own package to get the correct rubber lengths
between my exercises and neighbouring paragraphs, section headings

My problem is still that pre and post separations are added together
when one exercise comes immediately after another. I've guessed that the
amsthm package has some mechanism for suppressing this but after an
hour's look at theorem.sty I cannot work it out.

I hope my problem is clear. Apologies for rambling.

if you're using the techniques of amsthm.sty,
looking in theorem.sty probably won't help
much.  <g>

and, admittedly, the code in amsthm.sty isn't
crystal clear because it uses internal latex
tricks.  but essentially, what happens at the
beginning of a theorem element is
  \addvspace{\theorempreskipamount}
which first checks existing skip and resets it
to whichever is greater, the space already there
or the \theorempreskipamount.

Barbara,

thanks for the prompt reply, in fact I'm still working on this (although
just about to stop).

I found this...

http://compgeom.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/pubs/tex/scribe.sty

...and learned (I think) that correct spacing (not quite the same as
amsthm, still but) can be had with \trivlist, so I've hacked what's
there somewhat and come up with two new commands that basically work
(apologies for the code listings now, you're free to ignore them!)

I see in amsthm.sty that \trivlist is also used, so I hope I'm heading
along the right lines in adapting it here. I assume the amsthm package
cancels out the default \parskip and replaces it with it's own spacing?
I searched for your \addvspace and saw this:

+++

    \addvspace\@topsep
    \addvspace{-\parskip}%

done it again (it's copying a pasting that does it)...

    \addvspace\@topsep
    \addvspace{-\parskip}%

Anyway, I'm happy with what I have, I think, although I may yet find a
way to adjust the vertical spacing to match amsthm precisely, but not
tonight.

Subject: [texhax] pdftex and images
Message-ID: <47E2C69E.4050208@gmail.com>

I realise this is a ridiculous question. Sorry.

How on Earth do I include an image with pdftex?

I just spent an hour googling and reading, and I can't find anything better
than the pdftex manual, which has a rather obscure section on "Graphics
inclusion" which is more or less incomprehensible to me (and,
unfortunately, doesn't seem to contain an example).

I optimistically tried:
\pdfximage{map.png}
but that didn't do anything :-( [it neither gave me an error nor produced
any visible output]

I also tried a bunch of other things, but the best I ever got was a blank
page, and I've tried so many things that now I can't even remember how I
got that.

Please can someone just point me to a good example and put me out of my misery?

After \pdfximage use:
\pdfrefximage\pdflastximage

See /usr/share/texmf/doc/pdftex/examples/example.tex (or similar).

No such file on my system, but your suggestion did produce an image, for
which many thanks.

I had to add some \hskip and \vskip commands to get it in the right place,
but after a couple of iterations I got it where I wanted it. Thanks very much.

Are you using plain TeX or LaTeX?   If you are using plain TeX, look
for \pdfrefximage in the manual.  

In LaTeX \includegraphics{map.png} should be sufficient.

Message-ID: <47E2ADEE.1030804@swissmail.org>

Hi,
I desperately need help.
I am using pdflatex under opensuse 10.3 (i.e. the latest version).
I have two computers with what I thought was exactly the same 
installation. But on one computer the processing of my simple
.tex file works without problems. On the other computer I get
the following error message

I tried to reinstall everything from the default repositories.
I tried to compare the contents of the relevant directories on the
two computers. I tried to compare the settings of the environment
variables and the output of texconfig.
I can't find any difference between the two installations.

The missing file 'html.sty' is actually not missing!
It is in /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/html/html.sty !
As it is on the machine where everything is working.

I suspect some setup file is not correctly written.
But which one.
And how can this be if I installed everything as it
came from the repository on both machines?

Please help!

Thanks in advance.

Hi,
I already found a solution to my problem. It involved texhash.
Still don't understand why the installation didn't perform this
by itself, though.
Thank you.

Warnings are just warnings, but the problem is with the Error.

You are missing html.sty

You must download this and install this class.

Start by looking in the CTAN repository

pdf(e)tex is "plain" TeX. pdf(e)latex is the "LaTeX-version".

Doc:
"No such file on my system"
I'm sure there's a example.tex in your system. Which TeX-distro and
opsystem do you use? In linux maybe you should install tetex-doc or
similar package.

There are loads of them (44 to be precise, below /usr), but not the one
that you mentioned; and in particular there is none related to pdftex:

----

[H:usr] find . -name example.tex | grep pdftex
[H:usr]

----


Apart from the fact that I have added the LM fonts, I am running a vanilla
installation of TeX as provided by 64-bit Kubuntu gutsy, which seems to be
based on texlive.

Hi, 

I just installed Latex on my computer but cannot get it to work. I think it has to do with the TEX-distribution

I have defined the profiles LaTex=>DVI, pdf and PS but when I try to use the configuration wizzard, I cannot find the full path directory, where the executable (latex,tex, ect) of my TeX-distribution are located.

I tried the following paths but did not get any where:

C:\Program Files\MiKTex 2.7\
C:\Program Files\TeXnic Center\
C:\Document and Settings\Jean-Guy\My Documents\LaTex
C:\Program Files\MiKTek2.7\bin

When I try the above paths, the configuration wizzard gives the following message:

The application 'LaTex'has not been found in the directory of your TEX-distribution.

Please enter the directory where the executable file (tex.exe, latex.exe, ect) are located as your distribution's directory.

Could you please help me with this problem.

Thank you for your kind attention

I don't think so. If you install TeXnicCenter *after* you install  
MikTeX, the former should set its paths correctly.

LaTeX=>DVI should be

LaTeX compiler:
C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.7\miktex\bin\latex.exe

BibTeX:
C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.7\miktex\bin\bibtex.exe

MakeIndex:
C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.7\miktex\bin\makeindex.exe

LaTeX=>PDF

LaTeX compiler:
C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.7\miktex\bin\pdflatex.exe

That sounds like the file-path hashing is set up differently.
You can verify the search using kpsewhich.  There is a way
to show the search path, but I forget it.

By any chance was the broken system upgraded from an older install
with tetex, which may still partially exist?  You may be pulling
input files from the old directories.  Or you may have environment
variables set differently.

Hi everybody,

I have been trying to compile my .tex file many times using both pdflatex
and latex but unfortunately I get the following error message:

Unknown graphics extension: .eps

If I change the format of the graphics files to .pdf, then it compiles
correctly. However, the journal where I want to submit my document only
accepts .eps graphics files.
Can anybody help me?

Thanks

then you cannot use pdflatex, as it does not support eps.

what kind of formats are your figures in?

pdflatex doesn't know what to do with .eps
You have to run through normal latex, then dvipdf

Message-ID: <19af81400803250552k1e63ce1axc97ff849d8cb46a@mail.gmail.com>

I am using memoir class. I would like to have some chapters having
special sections in the end, called Appendices. So it would be like


1 Chapter
    1.1 Section
    1.2 Section
    1.3 Section
    1.A. Appendices

2 Chapter
    2.1 Section
    2.2 Section
    2.A. Appendices
    2.B. Appendices


etc and while subsections in regular sections are 1.2.5 and similarly
numbered environments (like equations, theorems)
in Appendix type of sections they should be numbered as 1.A.8   etc

I would like to have toc and pdfbookmarks listing appendices.

Is the an elegant solution not based on manual reseting numbering but in

\newcommand{\append}{????}


Thank you.
          Victor

check the subappendices in the memoir manual, this might do the job

\begin{subappendices}

\section{First appendix to this chapter}

blah blah

\section{Second appendix to this chapter}

blah blah

\end{subappandices}

\chapter{Next chapter}

memoir manual page 81

My figures have been created using MATLAB.
I have already tried using latex and later dvipdf and it works.
Thanks for the advice!

You can use .eps graphics with the epstopdf package, by Heiko Oberdiek:

\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{epstopdf}

In your terminal or Command Prompt type

texdoc epstopdf

Message-ID: <44ff02430803251838qc2024dfy59d810f78e5dfaa0@mail.gmail.com>

I know you are not supposed to indent the first paragraph of a section, but
I am unable to find an authority on the subject. So far the best I have
found is an MIT webpage (
http://web.mit.edu/answers/latex/formatting/latex_indentfirst.html). Can
anyone direct me to a style manual? I could not find it in the Chicago
Manual of Style, and I am trying to settle an argument.

And to offer a potentially useful piece of information, you can include the
indentfirst package to indent the first paragraph.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <C01DAABD-C514-4218-B8A4-4C6D8762CD68@alphabyte.co.nz>

Hi,

Sorry for the cross postings but I am having a frustrating time with a  
persistent error with citations in captions in figure and table  
environments.

The input is more or less the same in each case:...

  \caption{Work System Lifecycle: \emph{Source, adapted from~ 
\citeauthor{Alter2002a}, \citeyearNP[p.~95]{Alter2002a}}.}  
\label{fig:WorkSystemLifecycle}

... and each returns an error as below:

! Illegal parameter number in definition of \reserved at a.
<to be read again>
                    }
l.101 ... \emph{Source~\cite[p.~93]{Alter2002a}}.}
                                                     
\label{fig:WorkSystemFram...

Any clues as to what I may be doing wrong or is this a bug?

I am using TeXLive 2007 so if there is a newer version of apacite...

Cheers

	page
Message-ID: <dd258e120803260151m6835a0a5u64f5afd86e9100ee@mail.gmail.com>

I have run into the common problem of an unnumbered title page after
which page numbering are reset. This breaks hyperref with the error
message "destination with the same identifier (name{page.1}) has been
already used, duplicate ignored", because from hyperref's point of
view, page 1 occurs twice.

This error is described in the TeX FAQ
(http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=pdfpagelabels) but
offers no elegant solution.

Should I set the title page number to -1 or something like that?

For the record, here in Brazil the habit is to indent all paragraphs.
As a matter of fact, I don't recall ever seeing something printed in
here that was not done like this (while I have seen American
publishings that do indent the first paragraph.)

This seems to be a rule for other latin countries, too, but I cannot
speak for sure.

(it is a legacy file). I am happy how bibliography looks like. However
I have an obvious problem with \cite{}:

[Snip]

Apparently, Robert Bringhurst recommends not indenting the first
paragraph in his Elements of Typographic Style.

Bringhurst, 1st ed.:

    2.3.1 Set opening paragraphs flush left.

    The function of a paragraph indent is to mark a pause, setting the
paragraph apart from what precedes it. If a paragraph is preceded by a
title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be
omitted, as it is here.

Only apply this if there is vertical space in-between the header and
the body text (as in the example I quoted).

I found the above in a similar discussion here (by googling):
http://ask.metafilter.com/18872/No-indentation-of-initial-paragraphs

Thanks Erik, Ross and Stefan,

\protect certainly did the trick. Something I should have remembered, but in
the heat of the moment of frustration :)

As Erik pointed out, \cite is fragile and while natbib has resolved the issue
apacite has yet to.

Subject: [texhax] Please don't feed the birds
Message-ID: <200803262111.m2QLBMX09140@perseus.hcc.hawaii.edu>

At a local restaurant this morning I saw a sign that said "Please 
don't feed the birds."  That request was then repeated in about 
seven different languages.

It occurs to me that with help from the TeX community, I can do
much better than that.

Please send me (at sam at tug.org or sam at perseus.hcc.hawaii.edu) the TeX
(LaTeX) code that would print "Please don't feed the birds" in whatever
language(s) you can.  I'd like to create a sign containing that request
in as many languages as possible.  It seems to me that the result
should be attractive.  Please include whatever other code that I will
need to create the document.  Also, please make it clear, in English,
what language (and dialect?) is being used; I surely will not know in
many instances.

I will, of course, send you the result if you so request.

Thanks,

Sam.

Is the sign intended to help the birds,
or help the restaurant owners and customers ?
I would far prefer to dine at a restaurant
where feeding the birds (with appropriate food)
is encouraged.

Sam is in Hawai'i, so these aren't town pigeons, inured to the  
presence of man, but wild creatures which need to be protected and  
encouraged to live in their natural habitat

Actually, it doesn't really matter where you are, feeding wildlife is  
usually a bad idea (check w/ your local fish and game commission),  
unless you're planting some sort of plant which will provide food /  
cover.

Please allow me to edit that to say, ``...some sort of _local /

The oxford guide to style just mentions that "it is common not to indent 
the first paragraph in each chapter or the first new paragraph following a 
heading..."

Hi, 

I'm using latex (foiltex) to produce slides. 

It would be nice to tell it to make all text in one color, and all math-mode
content in another color. Anyone know if there is a way to do this ? the
only option I currently see is to do it manually each time. 

 

Thanks, 

Ofer

Actually there is a serious TeX question. The common ground is to use utf8

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{cmap}
\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc} %tells to use Russian fonts
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\begin{document}
??, ??? ?????? ?????? ????? ????????? ????????????!
\end{document}

which is the stern warning which (may be)  will prevent Russian
speakers from feeding the birds :-)

But what to do with conflicting options for \fontenc? Should we list them all ?

Dear Yiqing,

Maybe one of the real experts will chime in after me but graphics and  
figures don't need to be in one-one correspondence.

You can do:

\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\includegraphics[graphic1]
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\includegraphics[graphic2]
\end{minipage}
\caption{Two great graphics in one figure}
\end{figure}

If you want more than this, like labels for the individual graphics,  
look into the subfigure package.

Hope that helps.

Does this help?

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{color}
\everymath\expandafter{\the\everymath\color{red}}
\begin{document}
\color{blue}
The test is in blue and the math in red: $\mathrm{incarnadine}=\infty$, ok?

Dear Sirs,
my name is Marek Pietrow and I am from Poland. Recently I use LaTeX to 
write my thesis. Please give me some advices concerning following 
problem (or redirect me somewhere else where it is possible to get such 
advices):

Till now I have used the bibliography in the form:
\begin{thebibliography}
\bibitem...
...
\end{thebibliography}

but after computing many positions of the literature the problem 
appeared- my reference list must be listed out in the order of citing 
sequence. I have no idea to reorganize this list except of using BibTeX. 
As I know BibTeX requires to place all the information in the specific 
pattern, which requires much work (I have about 300 positions of citing 
literature which changes). Is there other tool which just reorganizes 
written list in the right way?
Best regards. Marek Pietrow.

If the purpose of the exercise is the result, not the process, it
might be the easiest and the most robust to use plain TeX and type
non-Latin characters as ^^xx, where xx is the hexadecimal position of
the glyph in the font.  Something like this:

-------------------->%--------------------
\font\birds=t2a-anttr \birds

% Russian
% ??????????, ?? ??????? ????!
^^cf^^ee^^e6^^e0^^eb^^f3^^e9^^f1^^f2^^e0,
^^ed^^e5
^^ea^^ee^^f0^^ec^^e8^^f2^^e5
^^ef^^f2^^e8^^f6!

% Ukrainian
% ???? ?????, ?? ??????? ??????!
^^c1^^f3^^e4^^fc
^^eb^^e0^^f1^^ea^^e0,
^^ed^^e5
^^e3^^ee^^e4^^f3^^e9^^f2^^e5
^^ef^^f2^^e0^^f5i^^e2!

\bye
--------------------%<--------------------

Actually, this method has its own advantages -- it shows how to type
in various languages without having to switch keyboard layouts!

Actually the easiest way is to put
\input{cyracc.def}

and use wncyr fonts and translit.

All methods not involving native language inputs however are very
error prone and require very careful checking of the output.

So has translit, but it requires input and many inputs could be conflicting

I am afraid that determined Russian cannot be stopped by anything.
Note that Germans also usu verbotten rather than bitte

Subject: [texhax] simple rotate/invert character
Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.64.0803311137370.289@bryan-lepores-powerbook-g4-12.local>

is there a short command to rotate/invert a letter?  so that without 
having to start a new environment, one could do something like :

\invert{B}

or

\rotate{B}

so the "B" gets inverted or rotated?
