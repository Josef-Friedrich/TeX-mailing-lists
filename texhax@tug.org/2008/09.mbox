maybe switch to single-column mode just before \begin{tabular} (which
should be a non-float item). The two text columns above the table will
balance to same length. Use the tabularx package to stretch the table to
the full \textwidth, if you like. After the table proceed in 2-column
mode. This should give a rather logic reading sequence.

Hi folks
any tips on typesetting use case scenarios in LaTeX?
I'm looking for a quick an easy way of including several dozen use 
cases in a LaTeX document, so any help would be much appreciated.
Cheers

Subject: [texhax] TeX Live 2008 available
Message-ID: <200809012323.m81NNoQ29911@f7.net>

TeX Live 2008 is now officially released; for the list of basic links,
see the home page, http://tug.org/texlive.  For download and DVD
information, see http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html.

Perhaps the biggest news is that the underlying package infrastructure
has been completely rewritten, and dynamic package updates are now
possible.  We will be updating packages as they are released to CTAN (as
MiKTeX has been doing for many years).  For other news, there's a link
on the home page.

This seems a good place to mention that monetary donations to TeX
development will count double though August 2009 (up to US$10,000).  The
same generous donor as last year has provided matching funds (and an
outright grant).  Of course there are many non-financial ways to
contribute as well; see http://tug.org/texlive/contribute.html.

Happy TeXing,
Karl

All mirrors I've seen since yesterday announcement, for example,

http://carroll.aset.psu.edu/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/Images/

have 2008-08-22 as date; therefore, may I assume that if one already  
has that iso.lzma image (texlive2008-20080822.iso.lzma) one is up to  
date and doesn't
need to download anything else?

Best,

Do you mean use case diagrams? If so, I think pgf/TikZ or PSTricks  
could be your choice.

There is a mailing list, see <http://www.luatex.org/faq.html> for

All of the other posts were very good and I'm certain you'll find them  
helpful.

The short answer is LaTeX is a compleat (and complex) toolchain made  
up of a markup definition implemented as macros for the TeX  
typesetting tool for which specialized editors exist which are  
supported by a myriad of special-purpose utilities.

You may also find of interest a graphical front-end called LyX:

http://www.lyx.org

This also makes LaTeX very easy to install on Windows and affords one  
the option of directly entering raw TeX or LaTeX code at need.

That should probably go to the dev-luatex mailing list _after_ you've  
checked the archives and all documentation:

are only available to suscribers (so I will suscribe). But it may be a bug
since they say that "LuaTeX defaults to pdftex (but expecting UtF8
encoding)" and the problem has nothing to do with the encoding, so the
format file should compile without errors as it does in pdftex.

Subject: [texhax] Insert text at the beginning of bibliography
Message-ID: <48BC9615.9000905@sci.monash.edu.au>

Hello,

I would like to insert some text at the beginning of my bibliography. I 
am using pdfTex with Memoir class and natbib.

Other included packages (not sure if these are relevant): pdftex, 
amsmath, amssymb,  fontencm, textcomp, microtype, mathdots, hyperref and 
memhfixc.

Specifically, I would like to add a couple of lines of text to the 
effect that the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) number included in some 
of the references can be accessed by prefixing "http://dx.doi.org/" to 
the start of the DOI number. I would prefer to not include the full URL 
for each reference.

Any help would be greatly appreciated - thesis submission in a few days 
and this one has me tearing my hair out!

Many thanks,
David Vine

Hi William and Javier,
the best approach is to simply post the log file to this mailing list.

Correct.  The final ISO image for TL'08 is the 2008-08-22 build.
If you already have it, there's nothing more to get.

OTOH, the first dynamic updates should appear within a few days.

I presume that tlmgr will be updating /2008/ tree not texmf-local. I
also presume that the packages to be updated must be packed in some
special way as it is the case with MikTeX

Am I correct?

Dear All, 
 
I'm at the relatively beginning stages (1000 lines) of writing my own open-source DVI previewer which I plan on embedding in a future educational math-visualization software project.  It's going great.  I'm really seeing how much fun programming my own stuff can be (as opposed to programming useless bells and whistles for a dot com, my last real job many moons ago).  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone can point me to some repository of sample TeX files, preferably mathematical, that I can use to test/QA my DVI previewer.  Nothing too fancy, but preferably a wide variety.  I already checked out the TeX Showcase linked to TUG's home page and found some good stuff there, but was itching for some more.  
 
Thanks in advance,
-Daniel W. 
 
P.S.  I posted to this mailing list about 2 years ago, when I first had the idea of a math-visualization educational tool, but have postponed beginning the actual coding of it till just a couple of weeks ago, due to personal issues.  Anyway, I really really liked the response I got from you guys back then, and wanted to thank you all again for helping and encouraging me.  I only wish I was in a position to begin coding it back then, but better late than never.

A DVI previewer that handled rotation, postscript and actively updated
when the file changed would be nice ...

Have you looked at www.arxiv.org?

Lots of stuff there, w/ the source available for download.

Or just look at some of the math tutorials (Gr?tzer's Math into LaTeX)  
and chunk that down.

Or, grab one of the opensource math textbooks which uses LaTeX:

http://linear.ups.edu/opentexts.html

Compleat site on this sort of thing here:

You may find that educational math-visualisation will soon require a
MathML+SVG viewer: and one that uses the algorithm from TeX to format the
maths would be really nice!

Thanks so much for the links, William!  They were really helpful.  Chris and Tom, thanks for the suggestions!  While I can't promise that my DVI previewer will be much more than a primitive tool to suit my own eccentric needs in the offing, I will say that I eventually do want to address feature requests of other people who are building similar educational software.  Back to coding!  I'll be sure to re-post to this mailing list when the DVI previewer is ready for others to play with.  (Maybe several months from now?)

Right.

Right.

I am using memoir with parts, chapters etc. I noticed that in the

How to fix the first one and force those bookmarks on the top level?

Message-ID: <e99407f60809070404i15745668ra7b93cd38c0540e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm having problems with usage of defined macros simply being
ignored by TeXlive (standard, full Ubuntu 8.04 installation).
These are macros with several parameters (see below) and were
ported from Mac (Textures). I've minimized the problem and am
now at a loss why this simple macro use is being ignored:

\def\Thema#1\par#2\par#3\par{\vfill\supereject\nopagenumbers
\message{#1}% show the Thema title on the terminal
\setbox\Themabox=\vtop{\offinterlineskip\hbox{\strut#1\unskip}
   \hbox{\strut#2\unskip}
   \hbox{\strut#3\unskip}}}

Though the \message is being shown during parsing of \Thema usage
with three arguments later on. See attachment of plain tex file
and the PDF, which is missing "Title of publication here", and
"Firstname Lastname Date" at the top of the page.

As far as I could tell, all definitions conform with Knuth's TeXbook,
so I'd be very happy if someone could elaborate what's wrong here,
or any pointers regarding where to start looking.

$ tex --version
TeX 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.6)
kpathsea version 3.5.6


Thanks,

Kemal Akman

Subject: [texhax] Vertical leaders alignment / Actual line width
Message-ID: <BAY104-W51A1E1B24BC2E0B8C98AE8B3550@phx.gbl>


Hi again,
in case anyone's interested, I found a solution, though admittedly imperfect:
In essence, I calculate the TOTAL line width, if all the title were to be put on one line, then keep subtracting the MAXIMUM line width allowed, till I end up with a sort of "mod" line width for the last line. The only problem with this approach is that it doesn't take the actual WORDS into account, so it assumes Latex will just break the line at any point, which isn't the point of course. This way, the width calculated for the last line will always be <= the line width Latex will end up giving us. Still it gives a good estimate, and I just added some fixed extra width to the line to account for that. Here's the code:
          %save chapter title in a box, all on one line
          \sbox{\chapterbox}{\rm\Large\expandafter\MakeUppercase{\chapterlabel}}%
            %maximum allowed width
            \setlength{\chapterwmax}{\textwidth}\addtolength{\chapterwmax}{-\chapterrulet}\addtolength{\chapterwmax}{-2\p@}%
            %actual width of the chapter title, possibly longer than the maximum allowed width
            \setlength{\chapterw}{\wd\chapterbox}%
            \ifnum\chapterw>\chapterwmax%
                %keep subtracting the width of one line from the chapter title, until left with the width of the last line
                \ifnum\chapterw>\chapterwmax\addtolength{\chapterw}{-\chapterwmax}\repeat%
                %the width of the bottom rule is the maximum width minus the width of the last line of the chapter title
                \setlength{\chapterrulew}{\chapterwmax}\addtolength{\chapterrulew}{\chapterrulet}\addtolength{\chapterrulew}{-\chapterw}%
                %extra space, because last line width will always be larger than total text width %(number of lines - 1)
                \addtolength{\chapterrulew}{-25\p@}%
                \setlength{\chapterw}{\chapterwmax}%
                %now set the title in a parbox of width=maximum width
                \sbox{\chapterbox}{\parbox[b]{\chapterw}{\raggedleft\rm\Large\expandafter\MakeUppercase{\chapterlabel}}}%
            \fi%

Hope this helps someone somewhere!
Cheers.


--------------------
Original Message:
Hi, I'm trying to format chapter titles in a frame, where the title text is aligned bottom-right, and where the bottom line of the frame is vertically aligned with the baseline (thus the title text) and also ends right before the text startes, so it looks something  like this:
_________________
|                            |
|_____chapter name|

If anyone is familiar with the "Glenn" style in the fncychap package, this looks basically the same...
Anyway, I got up to that point, the trouble is when the text of the chapter title doesn't fit on one line. Ideally, I would want it to look like this:
__________________
|                             |
| A very long chapter|
|      title which spans|
|______several lines|

I got as far as putting it (right-aligned) in a parbox, and adjusting the vertical lengths. The trouble is with the bottom horizonal line: I give the maximum length for par-width, so doing it with rule+hfill+parbox like with single lines results in a zero-length rule, because the parbox takes up all the width. I checked out the pbox package, but it doesn't give me the width of the last line which is the one I'm interested in, and which is mostly the shortest.

I have several thoughts but I'm not exactly sure whether they make sense or how to implement them:
- If I could only find out the actual width of the last line, I could manually set the width of the bottom rule. But, like I said, pbox didn't calculate that.
- One could integrate the bottom line INSIDE the parbox, like with leaders or something. It's the closest I got, but then it's aligned with the first par line of course. Is there a way to indicate the vertical alignment of the leaders, so I could say it should point to the bottom line?
- One idea is to manually separate the lines of the parbox, but I'm not sure how, and is prob way difficult and not very clean...
- I tried setting the parbox first, vskipping and hskipping back to where the bottom line should start, and then rule+fill, but of course it then ignores the parbox altogether and goes the whole textwidth (right acros the bottom line).
- I thought maybe a white hrule or underline or something in the bottom of the parbox (are white chars processed at all or just ignored? Not even sure...) to overwrite the bottom rule where the bottom text is ("several lines"), but again not sure how...


ANY ideas are appreciated!!
Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <D9A345DB-28DB-4C64-AD94-A9EFF67F46F9@alxp.gr>

Hi all,

I didn't find any previous post on this topic, so sorry if it had  
already been covered (it seems to me that it should be a frequent  
question).

I wanted to know if there's a method to compile a small piece of LaTeX  
code to a standalone PDF output containing only that part. I might not  
be very clear, but I basically want to convert for example a formula  
to a PDF output displaying that formula as interpreted by LaTeX (for  
example as latex2html does, or even as MediaWiki does with texvc and  
the <math>...</math> construct - except I am looking for PDF output  
and not PNG).

For the moment, I am only aware of the following workaround:

-create a tex file that will contain nothing more than the formula to  
be displayed (i.e. use \pagestyle{empty}).
-use the latex engine
-use dvips -E to find a tight bounding box
-convert to PDF.

But that's not satisfactory when I want, for some reasons, to compile  
using the pdflatex engine. So my question is, how can I generate a PDF  
using pdflatex in a way that acts like (latex + dvips -E + epstopdf) ?

Thanks for your answers.

An idea (untested) : typeset into a box, measure
the box, then set PdfTeX's page dimensions to the
box dimensions before shipping the box out.

Something like :

\setbox 0 = \hbox {$x = {-b \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}$}
\hsize = \wd 0
\vsize = \ht 0
\advance \vsize by \dp 0
\pdfpageheight = \vsize
\pdfpagewidth = \hsize
\pdfhorigin = 0 px
\pdfvorigin = 0 px
\box 0
\end

You'll need to:

  - wrap the equation / tex bit in a wrapper which loads any needed  
macros and packages and \begin/\end{document}s

  - include a macro wrapper which typesets the macro into a box,  
measures the box and sets the page size to that (using say the  
geometry package)

Or you could post-process the .pdf

If you're using Mac OS X you may find LaTeXiT of interest:

http://ktd.club.fr/programmation/latexit_en.php

Which is a re-creation of the NeXTstep TeXview.app's tex eq -> eps  
Service for .pdfs

with preview.sty

\usepackage[active,tightpage]{preview}

or use pgf/TikZ and

\beginpgfgraphicnamed{...
 <stuff>
\endpgfgraphicnamed

you can use the same procedure with pdflatex and then crop the
resulting pdf with pdfcrop.

This looks to be the obvious pure latex solution, though others have
suggested the generic idea of changing the pagesize by measuring the
typeset box.

Personally, I use pdfcrop to post-process the pdf file. It does an
excellent job of cropping pdf files with options to add/subtract margins
and do other things.

You might find pdfcrop amongst your tex goodies somewhere, else find it
at ctan. The README says that it probably doesn't work in windows.

    how can I generate a PDF  
    using pdflatex in a way that acts like (latex + dvips -E + epstopdf) ?

Here's what I do:

pdflatex foo.tex
pdfcrop foo.pdf  # outputs foo-crop.pdf

pdfcrop is a Perl script by Heiko Oberdiek; it's included in TeX Live
and is available on CTAN.

Best,
Karl

It works fine on my WinXP PC. Of course you need to have Perl
installed.

Hi all,

Thank you very much for all of your answers. I took a look at the  
various proposals, and I retained the pdfcrop and the preview package  
ones.

Especially the preview package seems absolutely PERFECT for what I  
want. I will stick to that, but I just wonder: is there any reason to  
prefer one or the other solution? Wouldn't pdfcrop, as a perl script  
and as a PDF post-processor, be "less efficient"?

Additionally, there's the need to have perl installed (which isn't a  
problem for me as I'm on Mac OS X), but it could be a problem if I  
want to release my scripts.

Concerning LaTeXiT, yes, I already took a look at its sources, but I  
didn't really understand how it operates (there seems to be a three  
step way of guessing, from the most efficient to the most robust, and  
it seems like the robust method uses PS).

If you're curious about what I was doing, I was writing a script that  
converts a FIG file to a single PDF file (as opposed to the combined  
PDFTEX format, which comes with two files - having one single PDF file  
is more "portable" for sharing with others, for example). I really  
wanted pdflatex because my tex template file (the one to generate the  
preview from) must use the beamer class (which doesn't really behave  
well with latex), as my FIG file may contain overlay specifications.  
In which case I obtain a multi-image PDF that contains each step of  
the FIG file. Additionally, that creates a nice visualiser for a FIG  
file (which can be very complex to understand when you start having a  
lot of special latex text in it, and still more when that text has  
overlay specifications). I might consider in the future creating a  
Quicklook plugin from that (at the moment I'm too lazy to read the doc  
about that).

If anyone is interested, I can post it to the list at a later time,  
when it's well polished.

Regards,

ap

Not directly related the question by OP, but I tried the pdfcrop package
and was surprised at the resulting file size :

    cv.pdf        -> 161 kB
    cv-crop.pdf   -> 742 kB

For a cropped file, I find that size increase is too much :-)

Posted this to the LyX list, but thought it should be archived here so  
it would be easier to find.

Since pdflatex can't insert .pdf tags (or is there a package for  
this?), you need to certify against pdf/A-1b:

- Open the file in Adobe Acrobat
- Save File As and choose as Format: PDF/A
- choose pdf/a-1b in the pop-up
- quit Acrobat
- re-open the file
- preflight (successfully) as PDF/A-1b

That said, I also posted a message to the dvipdfmx list, hoping to  
stir up some effort in doing this more directly --- does anyone know  
if it's on the radar for luatex?

Some steps has been taken by Heiko Oberdiek in package hyperref.

2008-04-16  6.77p  Heiko Oberdiek
    * New option `pdfa' to improve compatibility with PDF/A,
      see README.

>From the README:

Option `pdfa'
-------`----'
  The new option `pdfa' tries to avoid violations of PDF/A in code
  generated by hyperref. However, the result is usually not in PDF/A,
  because many features aren't controlled by hyperref (XMP metadata,
  fonts, colors, driver dependend low level stuff, ...).

  Currently, option `pdfa' sets and disables the following items:
  * Enabled annotation flags: Print, NoZoom, NoRotate [PDF/A 6.5.3].
  * Disabled annotation flags: Hidden, Invisible, NoView [PDF/A
6.5.3].
  * Disabled: Launch action (\href{run:...} [PDF/A 6.6.1].
  * Restricted: Named actions (\Acrobatmenu: NextPage, PrevPage,
    FirstPage, LastPage) [PDF/A 6.6.1].
  * Many things are disabled in PDF formulars:
    * JavaScript actions [PDF/A 6.6.1]
    * Trigger events (additional actions) [PDF/A 6.6.2]
    * Push button (because of JavaScript)
    * Interactive Forms: Flag NeedAppearances is the default `false'
      (Because of this, hyperref's implementation of Forms looks
ugly).
      [PDF/A 6.9]

  The default value of the new option `pdfa' is `false'. It
influences
  the loading of the package and cannot be changed after hyperref is
  loaded (\usepackage{hyperref}).

  ToDo:
  * XMP support
  * ...
  But perhaps Adobe Acrobat is now happy and can now convert
  the PDF file to PDF/A.

Hi

I am MikTeX user, i wanted to know if there's a method to compile pdflatex without disturbing the figures (figures are in pdf format), all the figure i am converting from eps to pdf for pdflatex purpose because it will not read .eps files and i don't want to use .jpg format. But the problem is when i compile tex file using pdflatex, inside the figures some characters are not displaying because in eps format Open Type Fonts fonts have been used, and pdflatex using type1 fonts and type1 have only 256 characters and that character will not come under 256.

I might not be very clear, but I basically want to convert for example a TeX to a PDF output without disturbing the figures, is there any way to skip a figures while compiling using pdflatex like 
(latex + dvi + dvips + pdf(acrobat distiller)) ?

Thanks for your answers.

Is the font embedded in the figures?

pdflatex does not change included figures. Can you make a figure
and a minimal sample document showing the error available online?

See the fancyhdr package documentation:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/fancyhdr/

It's very likely you already have it in your distribution. For article  
class, you will have to use

\documentclass[twoside]{article}

I'm think you mean proTeXt

http://www.tug.org/protext/

and that the missing ``t'' was just a typo; if that's so, proTeXt is a  
repackaging of MiKTeX, and therefore you should have an application  
called ``Update'' inside the MiKTeX directory.

Maybe it will need to update it's binaries before doing the TeX  
distribution update properly.

Personally, I don't use MiKTeX, but I know it is a very up to date  
distribution.

Best,

Axel

Certainly there is, redefine the \includegraphics... to insert nothing
but an invisible vertical rule being as high as the figure would be ...
but sorry, I can't afford doing this right now, better somebody with
daily practice with including graphics might do it.

>pdflatex does not change included figures. Can you make a figure

I have an example of a .tex -> .pdf "skipping" an "embedded"
(I thought) .eps, contrary to my intention. I kind of remember
that this is a known problem, yet I can't afford ...
I mean, the place filled by the figure in YAP is nothing but empty
space in the .pdf.

Sorry ...

     Uwe.

Hi

I am MikTeX user, i am using hyperref package with dvips option to get linking in the pdf. The problem is if i use this package with pdflatex the links are going to the particular place where it is required, but if i use dvips option after creating the pdf the links are going to that page not particular place.

Hi mahi,
remove the dvips option.  Hyperref is smart enough to find out whether
you are creating dvi or pdf.  You have to specify a driver in very
rare occasions only.

I don't know why you specified a driver at all.  Who asked you to do
it?  Please ***never*** search Google if you encounter a problem with
LaTeX.  There is too much crap in the internet.  The only reliable web
site is:

  I've downloaded MiKTEX v. 2.7 from one of the CTAN mirror sites, and
successfully used it with the American Astronomical Society's AASTEX
v5.2 macro to create a typeset draft of a new journal article.  I can
successfully build and then print the file to my local laser printer
without incident.  However, I can not save a copy of the built .dvi
file.  The only menu option for saving that file is "print" it to my
computer as a .pdf file.  I would be very happy with that option, but it
doesn't work.  I originally got a Metatext resolution error that my IT
group has been trying to resolve without success.  (There is no formal
support at my institution for TEX.)
 
  Can you offer any suggestions as to how to successfully save (i.e.,
"print") such files in .pdf format?

Maybe because Knuth decided that there should be a 1 inch offset by
default (horizontally and vertically.).

Please try:
 
  \advance \hoffset by -1in

\usepackage{hypdvips}

     http://ctan.tug.org/pkg/hypdvips

     "The hypdvips package fixes some problems when using hyperref with 
dvips."

- I don't mean to have understood anything, just an association,
due to some accident or magic or the package author just read
Mahi's posting and released a new version, now announced by
ctan-ann.

I don't know if I fully understand what you mean, and I don't know  
what editor you use, but in general you have two ways to get a PDF:

1) If you don't have postscript specials (like, say, PSTricks  
figures), simply click the button PDFLaTeX in your editor (TeXmaker,  
TeXnicCenter, etc.).

2) If you have postscript specials, typeset with LaTeX and then click  
in the button DviPS to get a *.ps file which you can distill with, for  
example, Ghostscript or Adobe Distiller.

Again, I don't know if I'm really understanding your question.


Best,

Axel

Hi

I am MikTeX user, i am creating a pdf using hyperref.sty with dvips option, after converting to dvi + ps + pdf when i click that link in pdf for(reference, figures etc.......) it is not going to the proper place just its going to the particular page, but if i use same package with pdftex option the links goes to the particular references or figure, how can i fix this bug for dvips option.

I might not be very clear, but basically i want to convert a hyper linked pdf using dvi + ps + pdf, and in pdf when i click to the reference citation that should go to the particular number of reference section not particular page e.g. In text [15] if i click this in pdf it should go to the reference [15].

Thanks for your answers.

hyperref can detect if you compile with pdflatex directly to pdf
or with latex to dvi. In the latter case hyperref assumes you use
dvips + ps2pdf to get the pdf. You don't need to specify dvips by
option.

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}
\ref{sec:foo}
\lipsum[1-20]
\section{Foo}
\label{sec:foo}
\lipsum[1]
\end{document}

The above works with both pdflatex and latex->dvips->ps2pdf on my
MiKTeX system. You must be doing something differently.

HI ?

Thanks for the reply. The example what u have given is write only its working for me also, but this example (dvips) doesn't create a link in the pdf,only pdflatex creates the link.
 
I wanted to know if there's a method to compile pdflatex without disturbing the figures (figures are in pdf format), all the figure i am converting from eps to pdf for pdflatex purpose because it will not read .eps files and i don't want to use .jpg format. But the problem is when i compile tex file using pdflatex, inside the figures some characters are not displaying because in eps format Open Type Fonts fonts have been used, and pdflatex using type1 fonts and type1 have only 256 characters and that character will not come under 256.

Because of this problem i am creating a pdf with dvi+ps+pfd option and in hyperref packages i am giving option as a dvips.

Did the chararacters display before you included the pdf figure
in the document?

Make a minimal example that demonstrates the problem(s) and put
the original eps and pdf figures somewere online so others can test.

Can you tell me how I do this in Latex.

suppose I have this in the begining of me .tex file

\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

If I write
\begin{theorem}
\end{theorem}

then it will print 

Theorem 1.

If I write it again, it will print

Theorem 2.

How do I avoid printing ``1." in the first example and ``2." in the second example.
I mean I want to avoid printing the number after Theorem.

Please tell me how I may do it.
If you want I can pay you

Thanking you

Use \newtheorem*.

You'll need the amsthm package:

\usepackage{amsthm}

And no, you don't have to pay me :)

Message-ID: <d2e22f8e0809221527s52547a9eqb593d4623e4a4096@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I am trying to create my first LaTex document. I am using TexMaker as a
frontend, running Ubuntu 8.04 as my OS. I have created a few figures using R
with both the .eps and .png file format. Now I wish to import these into my
LaTex document. I thought this would be pretty easy and doubly easu
considering I was using TexMaker. Here is what I have done to try and enter
these figures:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}[dvips]

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{Graphs PNG/Color Contour SLI.png}
\caption{This is a test.}
\end{figure}
\end{document}

This portion of my document returns this error:

LaTeX Warning: File `Graphs PNG/Color Contour SLI.png' not found on input
line
48.
! LaTeX Error: File `Graphs PNG/Color Contour SLI.png' not found.
See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type H <return> for immediate help.
...
l.48 ...scale=1]{Graphs PNG/Color Contour SLI.png}
Try typing <return> to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type X <return> to quit.
! LaTeX Error: Cannot determine size of graphic in Graphs PNG/Color Contour
SLI
.png (no BoundingBox).
See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type H <return> for immediate help.
...
l.48 ...scale=1]{Graphs PNG/Color Contour SLI.png}
Try typing <return> to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type X <return> to quit.
File: Graphs PNG/Color Contour SLI.png Graphic file (type eps)
<Graphs PNG/Color Contour SLI.png>

Basically, I can't figure out why LaTex can't find my file. I have tried
entering the path manually and using the includegraphics function within
TexMaker using both an .eps file and .png. In both cases my .dvi output
simply displays the title of the figure and an empty black box. I know this
is super simple but all the documentation I have been able to find hasn't
been able to address my problem. Am I loading up the wrong driver? Any help
would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Sam,

I have not used Texmaker, but I think it may be because of the spaces
in your folder and filenames ? Have you tried a EPS or PNG file that
does not have any space in the filename and is present in your current
directory ?

The DVI output may not show the graphics in your document correctly.
Try to convert the DVI file to either PS or PDF using either: dvips
filename.dvi -o (or) dvipdf filename.dvi filename.pdf and check if the
PS or PDF file is all right.

HTH,

Senthil

To complement Senthil Kumar's reply,

1) If you want to use png images, typeset with pdfLaTeX; there is a  
button for that in TeXmaker.

As Senthil Kumar said, don't use spaces; and better yet, put all your  
figures (EPS and PNG) in a single directory (say, Graphs) inside your  
working directory, and then,

2)
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{epstopdf}         %<- To convert your EPS files to PDF
\epstopdfsetup{update,prepend}%<- This checks if your EPS file has
                               %   changed and, if so, updates the
                               %   the PDF file
\graphicspath{{./Graphs/}}    %<- Then no need to type the whole path
\begin{document}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{Color-Contour-SLI.png}
\caption{This is a test.}
\end{figure}
\end{document}

Best,

Axel

Hi

I never used TexMaker, but i think the below one works
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[10cm, 5cm][10cm, 5cm]{Graphs PNG/Color Contour SLI.png}
\caption{This is a test.}
\end{figure}


"[10cm, 5cm][10cm, 5cm]" it is the width of the bounding box you can the value according to your figure measurement.

As someone else pointed out your problem may be the spaces.  Spaces
are used for parsing in many unix systems unless you put quote marks
around the name.  I don't know if that can be done in LaTeX.  I wasn't
able to replicate your example (I got a different error message), but
I avoid the problem generally by replacing spaces in file names with
underscores.  I have a script for that (written in - ugh! - tcsh)
called usfn.  I have released it at:

ftp://ftp.ncifcrf.gov/pub/delila/usfn

It goes through all files in a directory and changes spaces to
underscores.  It also changes some other characters that cause parsing
problems, see the documentation.

Dear Support Group,

First of all let me thank you for all the time and work you are
investing in the TeXLive project. TeXLive has become for me a very
interesting and stable (La)TeX distribution not only for Linux but also
for Win32 systems.

But I think I have encountered a tiny bug in the description of
obtaining the TeXLive iso file.

At http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html you write:

" ...
The image is compressed with lzma. The results are much superior to zip
(or bzip2 or gzip), and for the file this size, it's worth it. If
needed, get the sources for lzma utilities and/or the lzma binaries,
including Windows, that we've compiled for TeX Live. From a command
prompt, run lzmadec <texlive2008.iso.lzma >texlive2008.iso to decompress
it.
..."

Well, I'm not very experienced as Unix or Windows User, I just wanted to
download and burn the ISO file on DVD on my Windows Vista PC. So I
followed your instructions, but it did'nt work. There is no command
lzmadec.

- Perhaps you mean the program lzmadec.win32.exe. OK, at I have found So
I have downloaded the file lzmadec.win32.exe and executed the command
lzmadec.win32 texlive2008-20080822.iso.lzma texlive2008-20080822.iso and
waited. But nothing happened. So I guess your description is incorrect
once more.

Please can you help me to do the right things in olrder to burn a
TeXLive DVD?

Thanks in andvance G?nter Thaler

Note the < and > signs in the command line. It should be

lzmadec.win32 < texlive2008-20080822.iso.lzma > texlive2008-20080822.iso


***

On the other hand, I think that the average Windows user will have a lot
of trouble with that decompression, many wouldn't even know what command
prompt is or what it means to type a command line.

Leo,
   Use the \date{} command. If you feed it no arguments, it will leave the
date blank; otherwise, you can put whatever you want in there.

Cheers,

Before \maketitle put \date{} %if you really want no date at all
or else \date{whatever text you want to put in place of "today"}.

But, IMO, every good document has an author, a title, and a date :-)

Recent versions of pdftex (at least) support spaces in filenames.  The
\input primitive had been extended.  Now you can say

  \input "foo bar"

in plain tex

or

  \input{"foo bar"}

in latex.  To be more precise, \input is a primitive, not a macro.
All macros which are using this primitive will inherit the new
behavior.  Since \includegraphics is a macro which depends on \input,
I assume that you can quote spaces in filenames there too.

What probably does not work are filenames with consecutive spaces.
tex (the program) regards any number of space tokens as one space
token.  The behavior depends on the format file you are using.  It can
be changed there.

BTW, I often see that people recommend not to use spaces in
filenames.  I disagree here.  All operating systems available today
support spaces in filenames somehow.  If you are using a GUI, you'll
have to fill out a form and it is not obvious which characters are
allowed or not in the "filename" field.  

It would be more helpful if people don't care about spaces in
filenames but file a bug report if something doesn't work as expected.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I have downloaded the .iso.lzma, decompressed it with the tex-live
program and all went well.I do not have access to the compressed file
at home but i would imagine that the program 7-zip would also
decompress the lmza file as several other decompression programs will.
 7-zip for windows does have a gui interface and the non command line
user might be more comfortable with it.  The texlive version is very
small and appears to be very efficient - as one would expect from that
source.

Agreed, but I prefer the date to be the date I wrote the document
(along with a version number and file name), not the date that the
document happened to be printed.  The date of the document creation is
more useful.

The distribution of the texlive2008.iso as a LZMA compression is 
unbearable. A really bad idea. No doubt it compresses better, but on 
every and each PC/MAC/Linux you have an unzipper ready to run. Rather 
download 100 or even 500MB more than run after a decompressor.

    The texlive version is very small and appears to be very efficient -
    as one would expect from that source.

Thanks for the kudos, but we (TL) didn't write any of the lzma tools
ourselves.  The format was invented by Igor Pavlov (who wrote 7-zip),
and we use the lzmadec from the lzma-utils (http://tukaani.org/lzma).

Technically, it is essentially the standard "deflate" ([g]zip) algorithm,
but with a vastly increased dictionary size.

Dear Walter,
what you say is pure crap.  Sorry.  Do you really need the ISO image?
The preferred way to install TeX Live is to use the network installer.

I could explain why TL-2008 is using lzma compression but I don't see
any good reason to do it.  There is a very good reason to use lzma
compression indeed.  But since you didn't ask but complained quite
impolitely, I'm not willing to waste my time.  Sorry.

Regards,
  Reinhard

If it's in zip format, you'll have to run a decompressor after in the
same way.

However, I do agree that the instructions for decompressing in Windows
(involving the command prompt, redirection, etc.) are too complicated
for the average Windows user. If some graphical decompressor (WinRar,
7zip, or whatever) supports decompressing lzma files, that tool should
be described.

Eh???   What the fuck are you talking about????????

What do you mean with

  "the instructions for decompressing in Windows"???????

Go to http://tug.org/texlive and follow the instructions given there.

Everything else is bullshit.

I'm refering to what this user posted:
http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2008-September/011006.html . And those
instructions (using lzmadec from the command line) are indeed in the
page mentioned in the post, http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html .

The ISO is useful if one wants to install TeXlive in several machines
(easier than setting up a proxy, at least).

PS: No need to CC me, thanks, I read the list.

You don't really know Windows users, do you? ;-)

I believe the page would need some screenshots describing each stage.
And even so, many users would find that incredibly difficult if it's not
just double-clicking on a file and clicking "Next" repeatedly. On the
other hand, these users would never know what to do with an .iso image,
so perhaps it's not such a big deal after all, as long as the easy net
install option is clearly indicated as the best way to install.

    every and each PC/MAC/Linux you have an unzipper ready to run. 

Which is why we provide pre-made lzmadec binaries for all the platforms
TL supports.

You are welcome to distribute the uncompressed .iso yourself.

Message-ID: <9f42a6dc0809231718y5cf105b7h568fafa538562ba7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a slightly unconventional need for latex that I'm hoping you latex
wizards out there can help me with.

The basic problem I'm trying to solve is:
Given some input plain text, create (i) an image that renders that text and
also (ii) output a file that records each printed character from the input
text and the corresponding bounding box coordinates of that character in the
image.

The first goal of creating an image from the text is the easy part, and in
fact I dont really need latex to do it. The second goal is very unclear.
However, given latex's outstanding ability wrt text layout, and the fact
that it can also handle things like equations etc. I imagine that this
layout information is computed and stored somewhere along the way, perhaps
even implicitly within the dvi file. (And maybe this is preserved in ps/pdf
files generated from that point on).

In short, do you know of a way to extract the bounding box coordinates of
the characters in the output dvi or via some other way that utilizes latex?

Thanks!

And there's precisely the kind of self-righteously arrogant ignorance that
makes some people never want to express themselves in public again. (In
another variant, it makes Kansas such a terrible place in which to live.)

The choice of a highly *nonstandard* compression/decompression algorithm
little used outside the *nix coterie typifies the worst stereotypes of "my
way or the highway" *nix users. (The arXiv suffered from this until Cornell
humanized it somewhat.)

The facts are that a network install is not an option if one is not on a
suitable network. I belabor the obvious to remind us that not all users have
the luxury of having their system maintained by an academic or corporate
sysad. (I do at the office, but not at home.)

And the question of why a more widely-used method (such as zip, or even its
crippled offspring gzip) was not chosen is not at all impolite; it is most
specifically pertinent. Especially when faced with the "my way or not at all"
attitude epitomized by not offering individual users any options whatsoever.

Duuuh, how about:

"get the sources for lzma utilities and/or the lzma binaries, including 
Windows, that we've compiled for TeX Live. From a command prompt, run 
lzmadec <texlive2008.iso.lzma >texlive2008.iso to decompress it."

That's where this crap comes from.  Also the download page for lzma
is terrible.


Walter S?gesser wrote:

The sizes are 1.19GB vs 2.44GB for lzma vs raw, but I'll have to
download the raw and zip it in order to compare sensibly.


If you want to help distribute the raw iso, download it by bittorrent
on a well-connected computer, and seed it.

I am not sure why Reinhard decided to demonstrate his rather limited
knowledge of English 4-letter words and definitely do not condone this
demo but I suspect that time spent to protest the usage of lzma would
be enough not only to install and learn how to use it but also to
study the whole algorithm in the details

PS I am thankful to TL team for forcing me to install highly effective
compression algorithm to my Mac

Bull pucky. That's just more of the same. 

To belabor what should be, but clearly is not, obvious: not every LaTeX user
is either a C coder or is sufficient knowledgeable about algorithmics to do
what you so blithely posit.

Nor is every user of LaTeX drooling in anticipation of learning how to use
the latestest and greatest (de)compressors, especially knowing that it's just
so this week.

TL2008 is the latest and the greatest only this year. Those who do not
want to spend 5 minutes to learn a new thing probably do not need
TL2008 or even TL2007 or even latex2e.

I've been getting into keeping a record of what I'm doing.  So in a
recently submitted paper named emmgeo I have:

\newcommand{\theversion}%
   {{version = 1.61 of emmgeo.tex 2008 Aug 12 }}
% 2008 Aug 12, 1.61: margin_control - remove top_margin PRL SUBMITTED VERSION
...
% 2008 Apr 26, 1.01: more typing
% 2008 Apr 26, 1.00: origin from handwritten sheets.

and then

\date{\theversion}

By doing it this way I can put \theversion anywhere I want and yet the
version numbers line up nicely.

I have a tool that saves and compresses the current version of the
paper according to the version number (eg emmgeo.tex.1.61.Z) in my
backup files.  So I have some idea when I modified the paper and it's
history.

Hm. Are you aware of the fact that miktex (a highly non-unix TeX-System)
use lzma since over a year?
And that 7-zip is a native windows application? To quote their website:
"7-Zip works in Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP/Vista. There is a port of the
command line version to Linux/Unix."

All miktex users -- may they work at home or elsewhere -- use a "network
installer" since many years to install and update packages without
problems.  You only need access to the web to use it. The package
installer does everything: Download the lzma, decompress it, put all
files where they belong, update the file caches, run updmap. 
Miktex also use a "network installer" for the first install (it is
called setupwiz).

We just had this discussion.

See the recent thread ``compile to a small PDF''.

Short answer, put the characters in a box and measure the box.

Long answer, look at the code for the preview.sty package.

Sorry, I should have worded my question more carefully...My intention is
*not* to get one bounding box for all the characters together, but to get
the bounding box coordinates of *each* character in the input text. So if
the text I want to render is "$y = x^2$", I'd like to be able to obtain the
bbox coordinates of "y", "=", "x" and "2".
Suggestions? Thanks!

Aaaah yes, now you have to: master the 7th level 6 times; ave 5 million guldern in your

Then put each character into a box and measure each box.

See Philip Taylor's response in the ``compile to a small pdf'' thread  
for a code sample which can be adapted to single characters.

Or you can observe that the definition of \input start with 
@\ifnextchar\bgroup
and branches accordingly :-).

Forgive my ignorance, but it seems like Philip's suggestion (
http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2008-September/010964.html) gives a way to
get a compact pdf file for a given text (or equation) string, and that your
suggestion is to do this procedure for each character, and then compute the
dimensions of each resulting image as the bounding box for the respective
character. But that is not what I want at all!

Following the above procedure would give me the dimensions that each
character requires *in isolation*. Working with my previous example, if my
text is $y = x ^2$, I want the coordinates (not the dimensions!) of the
bounding boxes of the individual characters  ("y", "=", etc.) as they would
occur when rendered within the whole $y=x^2$ string.

Consider the image obtained from rendering $y=x^2$. Imagine a 2D coordinate
system on this image with the origin at the bottom left of the image, its x
axis ranging from 0 to the width of the image and  its y-axis ranging from 0
to the height of the image. I'd like output in the form of a set of tuples
(left, top, right, bottom) for each of the 4 characters in the y=x^2
example, and the resulting bbox coordinates of "y" should reflect, for
instance, that its "left" field is smaller in value than, say, that of the
"=" character which is placed to the right of "y" when rendered in the
image. So I'm essentially looking the intermediate results after the
procedure that decides where exactly the characters are to be placed in the
image of $y=x^2$.

And no, these values cannot be obtained by simply using the bounding box
dimensions of the characters rendered in isolation. For instance the
dimensions of the "2" would be much larger when rendered in isolation as
$2$, than when it appears as a superscript to "x" in $y=x^2$.

Hope that makes the problem a little clearer. Suggestions? Thanks!

In my opinion, such language is both inappropriate
and totally uncalled for, particularly on a public
list such as this.  Whilst not everyone will
necessarily agree with the messages to which these
replies were sent, it would have been both possible
and infinitely preferable to cast the replies in
a considerably more moderate and less offensive tone.

if you have a little fun of hacking, the actually easiest and most
straightforward way seems to be adding print statements for page
coordinates (cur_h, cur_v) to the pdftex engine just at the few places
where glyphs and other stuff (rules etc.) are put on the page.

I agree. I don't think I fully understood what the argument was about,
but it was obvious that it could have been carried out more politely.
I didn't speak up at the time because I'm relatively new to this list,
and because I didn't want to be the target of such language.

Hartmut,

That sounds like a more promising general direction and I'd certainly
be up for pursuing it. Could you advise me on what the right entry
points for making these modifications would be? I haven't hacked latex
or the pdftex engine before, so any details (docs, webpages on related
topics etc.) would be immensely useful.
Thanks!

    If you want to help distribute the raw iso, download it by bittorrent
    on a well-connected computer, and seed it.

The raw iso is already available as a torrent --
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4370550/, as given on
tug.org/texlive/acquire.html.  (Thanks to Phil Taylor.)

Of course, many users (including me) do not have much luck in dealing
with torrents, so it's not a panacea.  Nothing is.

The iso zipped with "zip -9" has a size of 1.42GB.  I don't know
that the 230MB saving is worth the fuss, but it is not insignificant.

I don't know if it will help, but you might like
to look at the code that GUST use to produce
their logo :

	http://www.gust.org.pl/logo.jpg

I don't remember who it was who implemented this,
but I suspect one of Staszek Wawrykiewicz <staw at gust.org.pl>,
Bogus\l aw Jackowski <bop at bop.com.pl> or Jerzy Ludwichowski
<J.Ludwichowski at uck.uni.torun.pl> would be able to advise.

Hi,

I am looking for a little program to print a pdf poster on A4 pages on a

able to deal with multiple pages, able to read the bounding box from the
pdf, and called from the command line.

Can anyone recommend such a program?

Thanks in advance,

It is not 230MB we are talking about. It is 230MB *per download*.

There are people who are always unhappy. I had no idea what lzma is
and it took few minutes not only to get source but say magic words and
compile (I did not realize that tug distributes binaries)

Then I set LAN distribution of raw disks (on LAN even 1 GB is not
worth fuss usually)

Copywrite Holders Collective is coming after you; they would not
believe that anyone runs bittorrent (or buys blank CDs) to distribute
anything but illegal music. :-)

Subject: [texhax] Question about \skip\footins
Message-ID: <C0FA6DFC-A7F3-4C5D-A3C5-F4FF93D2C0AF@mac.com>

Hi,

I'm using the book class with no size option (therefore, 10pt with  
12pt baseline skip) and a sty file where I have defined footnotes as  
follow:

     \renewcommand{\footnoterule}{\vspace*{-3pt}}%

therefore, no rule between main text and footnotes; and

     \setlength{\skip\footins}{1.0\baselineskip plus0.5\baselineskip  
minus0.5\baselineskip}

therefore I would expect \skip\footins = 12pt, plus 6pt minus 6pt (the  
baselineskip of main text is *indeed* 12pt); but if I put anywhere in  
my document

     footins = \the\skip\footins

I get

     footins = 10.0pt plus 5.0pt minus 5.0pt

Can someone explain to me why this is so?


Thank you in advance.

Axel

Message-ID: <311224200809250225k78f08506hed4eedf001a1a14d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Does anyone here have experience with the \hyperbaseurl property of
hyperref. According to the documentation whatever address is in a
\href will get prepended with the value of \hyperbaseurl. Now, this
works fine for me for local relative url such as:

\hyperbaseurl{./}
\href{html/index.html}{Link to the index page}

I had hoped to be able to change the hyperbaseurl to e.g.
\hyperbaseurl{http://www.mysite.org} which would make my href now
instead point to 'http://www.mysite.org/html/index.html' but that does
not seem to be the case. What I'm trying to achieve is to change the
search path for all hrefs by changeing the hyperbaseurl property,
pointing to local as well as remote locations.

Am I doing something wrong or is this not the functionality intended
by hyperbaseurl? Is there another way to achieve the same result?

Thanks for any suggestions,

/henrik

I have the same problem with Spanish; the universal solution is, v.gr.,

\index{logica at l?gica}

so it would be \index{Oxxx@?xxx}.

For Spanish there is now esindex by Javier Bezos, but I haven't tried  
it. Maybe there is something similar for German.

Best,

you could build your own using some scripts and pdflatex + graphicx/pdfpages

I do something similar do grap one half of an A3 and glue it onto a 
preprint to use the the title page.

xindy, don't know if it is available on anything else than Linux yet. 
But on linux it can sort the danish alphabet correctly. It has loads of 
languages, so there should be one that suits you, otherwise you can 
specify your own sorting.

That's not what I get; I just did it get

      footins = 12.0pt plus 6.0pt minus 6.0pt

So, what you're really doing probably isn't quite as simple as your claim.

I imagine you've already considered this possibility, but what's wrong with
using ps2pdf on the postscript output from poster?

I'm using Walter Schmidt's lucimatx.sty (from PCTeX) with option  
lucidasmallscale, but I have ruled that out because a) it doesn't  
redefine fontins anywhere, and b) as I said, the leading *is indeed*  
12pt (I have a watermark 1pc grid to check that, and I get 43 lines of  
normalsize text with a 516pt textheight).

I'll try to investigate further, to see if I find what's going on.

Thanks a lot for your test and kind reply.

It has the print option "Tile large pages".

You could look into using utf-8.

Thanks, Phil, but ps2pdf's output keeps turning out wrong bounding boxes,
screwing this path :-(

I will check Acrobat's tile printing abilities, thanks for the pointer. I'm
quite curious if it rescales ... (I guess it will, which makes it unusable
for my purpose.)

Maybe stupid question: did you check this with
\hyperbaseurl{http://www.mysite.org/} ?
Your first example does include the slash, the second does not.

No, that's the whole point : it divides the image
into however many pages are needed to print it.
I have used this for the Kansai rail map (which
is unreadably small on A4 or even A3) and tiled
to A2, I can read everything !

I don't think it's a stupid Q at all., but I did try it and it makes
no difference, i.e. it will still not prepend the href address with
the hyperbaseurl argument. The trailing slash should be there, at
least for \hyperbaseurl{./} for \hyperbaseurl{.} does not work.

I just tried it but it doesn't help makeidx *sort* the index
alphabetically correctly. After all there is no language specific
information in utf-8. However, the Scandinavian characters I tried are
correctly rendered in the index with utf-8 (that is, without spelling
them out)

Yes, that is the torrent I meant.  Maybe we should put the same
torrent entry on mininova... it sounds less pirated...

Today I see an unsettling comment on the .lzma torrent:

  Compression is done with LZMA. But 7zip will *not* read the file, as 
  far as I can tell.  So the implementation of LZMA compression is a 
  little obscure, at least for Windows users.

I haven't tested this myself, and I don't know what version of 7zip the
commentator was using.

That is an error!  \footnoterule must consume zero vertical space.

No, we would have to know the details:  either \baselineskip is still
10pt when you set \skip\footins, or \skip\footins is later changed,
either by a setting you don't know about or because the first setting
was in a local group.

Literally, eureka! It's all about greek and T1 font encoding! Try this:

\documentclass{book}
%\usepackage[10pt]{type1ec}%        <- These two don't matter: enable
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}[2006/03/24]% <- them or leave them commented out
\usepackage[greek,english,spanish]{babel}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\setlength{\skip\footins}{1.0\baselineskip plus0.5\baselineskip  
minus0.5\baselineskip}

\begin{document}

footins = \the\skip\footins

\end{document}

As such, you'll get ``footins = 10.0pt plus 5.0pt minus 5.0pt''.

Now either delete greek in babel or comment out ``\usepackage[T1] 
{fontenc}'' and you'll get ``footins = 12.0pt plus 6.0pt minus 6.0pt''.

Whom should I report this?

Best,

Axel

Thank you. I'll look into this. I took half the code from The LaTeX  
Companion, 2nd ed., p. 112:

So to get no rule I omitted the second half of the code.

Thank you again.

    So to get no rule I omitted the second half of the code.

you failed to notice that this is a three-part
definition:
  \renewcommand\footnoterule{\vspace*{-3pt}%
     \hrule width 2in height 0.4pt
     \vspace*{2.6pt}}

the first part backs up three points;
the second adds .4pt as a rule;
the third adds 2.6pt of space.
the total space occupied is 0pt (-3 + .4 + 2.6).
so an equivalent definition without a rule would
be either
  \renewcommand\footnoterule{\vspace*{-3pt}%
     \vspace*{3pt}}
or just
  \renewcommand\footnoterule{}

Thank you very much for taking the time to explain to me what should  
have been obvious in the very first place.

See how the vspaces plus the height (thickness) of the rule add
up to zero?

For no rule, just define

\renewcommand\footnoterule{}

It seems to be a bug in \DeclareErrorFont, which sets the current font
size and baselineskip immediately, rather than just declaring a fall-back
font.

I thought \DeclareErrorFont sets size, not leading; but anyway,  
according to TLC 2nd ed., ``Its default is Computer Modern Roman  
10pt'', which by default has a leading of 12pt.

And again, this happens with a combination of greek in babel and T1 as  
font encoding ---either deleting greek from babel or commenting out  
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}, \skip\footins is, as expected, 12.0pt plus  
6.0pt minus 6.0pt.

I will write to Apostolos Syropoulos about this, but I don't know if I  
should report it to anyone else.

Best,

Axel

I just found out that even \usepackage[LGR]{fontenc} produces

??????? = 10.0?? ???? 5.0?? ????? 5.0??; so its  
all about greek and fontenc, not a particular encoding. I have already  
notified Apostolos Syropoulos. Anyone else?

    But 7zip will *not* read the file, as far as I can tell.  

That is too bad.  I guess lzma-utils and 7-zip are not compatible.  So I
won't bother writing anything about 7-zip.

The general question of the lzma file format is not settled.  The actual
compression method is fine, but the surrounding headers, magic bytes,
etc., are a subject of ongoing discussion.  Hopefully it will be settled
by next year.

I have version 4.23 installed and I can confirm that it is not
compatible with the .iso.lzma file.  I downloaded version 4.60 beta
and it can expand the archive.  The Windows GUI is marginally improved
also.

Hi Phil,
yes, you are right, excuse me please.  I had been upset because it
was not as easy as one might assume to switch from zip to tar.lzma and
it hasn't been done because it's more convenient for us.  I never
expected that someone complains.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Eduardo, please excuse my impoliteness, it was a quite spontaneous
reaction.

Apostolos Syropoulos found out that setting \skip\footins before babel  
and fontenc you get the expected result (as a matter of fact, it's  
enough to set it *before* fontenc, between babel and fontenc). I can't  
understand why, but this works:

\documentclass{book}
\setlength{\skip\footins}{1.0\baselineskip plus0.5\baselineskip  
minus0.5\baselineskip}
\usepackage[greek,english,spanish]{babel}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}


\begin{document}

footins = \the\skip\footins

\end{document}

Axel

Message-ID: <fa8771800809272208p7719159x7b25200bd018e4c9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I'm a bit of a TeX newbie.
I'm working on a project where I want to layout images and text in
rectangles. This is for creating playing cards (kinda like those for a
CCG) for games I design.
Basically I want to specify some rectangles, put images in some,
wrapped text in others. Might want to embed some icons in the text, as
well.

It seems like TeX might fit the bill for this, but what flavor should
I be looking at? LaTeX and most other macro packages seem to be
document-oriented (tracking table of contents and soforth).
Or maybe I should create my own set of macros, using plain TeX?
I'm a programmer; I don't mind if it gets technical, just don't want
to re-invent perfectly good wheels.

And, slightly off-topic, anyone have any pointers to other solutions
that might work for me?
I was also considering straight PostScript, since my needs are really
quite simple.
I initially was just going to use ImageMagick, but the text support is
not great, and I would have to do a lot of fiddling with font metrics
and such.

Have you considered option -g? This one provides treating O umlaut as Oe.

You could use ConTeXt, what you want is not so hard to achieve.

Hi John,
straight PostScript is certainly simple but there are a few drawbacks:
PS doesn't insert kerning automatically.  The other problem is that it
doesn't break lines automatically and doesn't hyphenate words.
On the other hand, drawing icons is quite easy in PS.

I would look into the latex picture environment. It allows you to
position objects easily.  Don't know whether you can use \parbox'es
(boxes containing aligned paragraphs) inside a picture environment.
This is not documented in the manual, but it's quite likely that it
works.

You can also use plain tex.  In this case I recommend eplain, an
extended version of plain tex.

  http://www.tug.org/eplain/doc/eplain/index.html

The advantage of eplain is that you can use the latex graphics package
in order to include external graphics. 

Whether latex or plain/eplain is better for you depends on what you
want to do exactly.  Since there is probably no latex package which
exactly does what you need, it's not easy to make a suggestion.

But here are a few hints at least:

Avoid to extend latex by plain tex code.  It's possible but requires
detailed knowledge about latex internals.  If things are not done the
latex way, there is no chance that latex issues a proper error message.

The icons are not a problem at all.  You can insert them everywhere in
your text.  You can load external graphic files or draw them directly
in the *tex sources.  There is a wonderful drawing tool called
TikZ/pgf

   http://ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/base/doc/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf

which supports latex and *plain.

I don't know whether eplain supports placing objects relative to a
particular origin.  This is what the latex picture environment does.
If it's not supported by eplain, consult "The TeXbook", there is an
example on page 389.

Sorry that I can't tell you exactly which approach is the best.  But
since you said that you are a programmer and even considered
PostScript already, I'm inclined to propose to look into eplain first.

Regards,
  Reinhard

 Namaste,

 

Iam very much new to Latex and am practicing it daily and getting used to
it, However I am not able to resolve few things:

1.     Iam not able to get the font colors - all I get is plain Black Text
as output.

2.     I would like to know the procedures or packages required for
incorporating Diagrams and Circuit-Diagrams

3.     Even the Graphics package though being called in the preamble, is
still not working

 

Your help and suggestions in this regard would be of great Endeavour. 

 

Warm Regards, 
  
Vasudeva,

For 1 and 3, could you send a minimal not working example? Also,  
please tell us what platform and TeX distribution you are using.

For 2a, what kind of diagrams? For 2b, see if the circ package works  
for you ---its documentation, in Linux or Mac, should be here:

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/circ/


Best,

Axel

Fine. For instructions to use the color package, at the Command Prompt  
type

texdoc grfguide <enter>

A pdf file with the title ?Packages in the ?graphics? bundle? should  
open. Read it to know how to use the color options.

And yes, the circ package will work on Windows ---it's already in your  
MiKTeX distribution. Also, at the Command Prompt type

texdoc circ <enter>

and you'll get the documentation.

(Next time, in your examples include your preamble as well, that is, a  
minimal non working example, but from \documentclass{<whatever class>}  
to \end{document} ---the preamble is crucial to know what's going  
wrong.)

Best,

Axel

The LaTeX Wikibook explains some essentials:

     http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing_Graphics
     http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Creating_Graphics
     http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Colors

The Topical Index of the TeX Catalogue is often helpful to find out what 
packages
serve certain purposes:

     http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html

Packages are listed "by topic", with a one-line description and a link to 
get more for each.

Packages for including graphics made outside TeX are listed here:

     http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#graphics

This is about drawing using TeX:

     http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#charts

And here is something about colours:

     http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#colour

This is just the CTAN directory of (free) packages for drawing and graphics:

     http://mirror.ctan.org/graphics/

-- Please note that many TeX users are not fond of getting
HTML (or likewise formatted) mails since their mail programs
show the script code instead of processing it.

HTH -- Uwe.

When I applied your suggested code all white spaces disappeared in the
title and author fields. The solution for me was to use the
pdfusetitle option for the hyperref package
(http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/README):

\usepackage[pdftex,pdfusetitle]{hyperref}

Hopefully it can solve your line break problem as well...
