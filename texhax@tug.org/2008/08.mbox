Subject: [texhax] updates for TeX Live 2008
Message-ID: <200808010025.m710P2M16432@f7.net>

We are nearing the end of the release cycle for TeX Live 2008.
No drop-dead date yet, but we're getting close.

So, if anyone is contemplating package updates that they'd like to see
on the DVD, please get them to CTAN as soon as possible.

At least this is less critical than it may have been in previous years,
since we can provide updates after the release that users can easily get
from the Internet, using the new dynamic package system that is the
principal new feature this year.

By the way, if anyone wants to help test before the DVD's get burned,
see http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html.

Thanks,
Karl

I am unable to find pst-char.sty file. I was away from my linux
computer using a windows machine and I cannot compile a talk because
the pst-char.sty file is no where to be found. Why do I find
references to this style file including a change from an old name to a

Once I get near my linux machine I will get the style file but being
out of town makes things hard, like I cannot edit my tex file because
it will never compile without this file. What I don't understand is
why did it go away?

ww,

    I am unable to find pst-char.sty file. I was away from my linux
    computer using a windows machine and I cannot compile a talk because
    the pst-char.sty file is no where to be found. Why do I find
    references to this style file including a change from an old name to a
    new name yet I cannot find it anywhere online?

the file pst-news06.pdf announces that

  The package pst-char is now part of pst-text and the package pst-ghsb
  is now part of pst-grad. The macros and enviroments will work in the same
  way.

presumably additional useful features have
been added that were more text-y than
character-specific, so a new name was
desirable.

pst-text *is* available from ctan.

Message-ID: <6b823fbc0808031108t2ff78856j322072ba30acdfaf@mail.gmail.com>

I've been searching for a way to typeset graphics in plain teX and
haven't really found much documentation on doing so.  Is this pretty
much black magic, or a lost art?  Are there any pointers for doing so
or even a howto that covers this?  I found the teTeX howto, but it
seemed to revert to laTeX when it came to graphics.  Maybe the only
option in plain teX is to leave a blank box where the graphic is
intended to go?

Any suggestions/help are appreciated.

The Tikz package for drawing graphics claims to work also in Plain Tex,
and is very powerful.

Well, I use (almost) exclusively Plain TeX,
and here is how I include my signature
(as a JPEG) at the bottom of my correspondence :

	Yours sincerely
	\vskip +1\baselineskip
	\setbox 0 = \hbox {\pdfximage width 60 mm {Philip-Taylor.jpg}\pdfrefximage \pdflastximage}
	\box 0
	\vskip -1\baselineskip
	Philip Taylor
	\end

This does, of course, rely on PdfTeX rather than
TeX proper, but I haven't used real TeX for some
years ...

    I've been searching for a way to typeset graphics in plain teX and

In addition to the pdfTeX and PGF answers already cited:

For simple .epsf graphics:
\input epsf.sty  % works with both plain and latex
... \epsfbox{filename.eps} ...
Read the beginning of epsf.sty for other features.

If you want to do more complicated things, you can use the LaTeX
graphics, graphicx, and color packages in plain TeX, via Eplain.
Essentially:
\input eplain
\beginpackages
\usepackage{graphicx}
\endpackages

(See http://tug.org/eplain for full documentation, etc.)

Happy picturing,
karl

P.S. Robin, perhaps
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=impgraph should be
updated with some of the above?

Message-ID: <20080804073656.GB8517@fzd.de>

Hi,

is there a way to get the functionalty of the LaTeX package `ifthen' in
TeX too? I am particularly interested in negating and combining boolean
expressions using \NOT, \AND, \OR.

It is surprising that TeX doesn't provide this functionality by itself,
as building complex conditional expressions is quite a common task and
even the most ancient and most primitive higher programming languages
provide the means for doing such things.

Regards,
Alexander

I think it would be better to use something like
\newenvironment{quotationRight}

If you redefine existing commands, you will most probably have forgotten
about that in a year or two when you try to re-use parts of your document,
and then wonder why it looks different...

Just my humble opinion,

TeX is not a programming language. :-)  (Though many people have used it
as one.)

Yes.  Check out the rotating package, use that plus \raisebox and some
\hspace commands to maneuver the title in the right place from the page
header or footer.  You may want to make a box the size of the text body
and center your book and chapter titles (read about the "marks") in it.

(n.b. the dvi programs probably won't display this properly, but they
end up ok in the pdf or ps output.)

Well if you can program a Mars rover in TeX, you can do almost anything

let me mention PiCTeX, just because I have dealt with it this year.
I'm attaching some "meta"-documentation for it.
But please don't consider this a recommendation!

Rather look at the UK FAQ:

Subject: [texhax] Drawing text boxes for forms
Message-ID: <1217875164.7680.5.camel@jigsaw>

Hello list,

I'm looking for a way to draw text input boxes for forms.

Examples:

		Time:		|_|_| : |_|_| : |_|_|
		Place of Birth:	?|_|_?|_|_?|_|_?|_|_?|_|_?|_|_|

Any idea how to do this nicely with tex? Is there already a helper class
or style for this?

Kind regards
Sebastian

Thanks for the suggested URLs.  I realize now that I was a little
vague in the description.

Let's assume that the graphic to be inserted will be an EPS (for now).

Based upon the rest of the suggestions, it looks like this won't
exactly work in just plain TeX and will require a bit of work on my
part to get going.  I might have to look at some of the graphics
handling in LaTeX to get some hints.

Thanks again,

Ludwig

There's a very rudimentary introduction to this in the TeXbook.  Looks
something like:

\def\mybox{\vbox{\hrule\hbox{\vrule\kern3pt
  \vbox{\kern3pt \kern3pt}\kern3pt\vrule}\hrule}}

Hopefully this will give you an idea on how you could construct your own.

I didn't see this until just now!  Gmail filtered this particular
message (time to retrain).  This might be something that will work.

Subject: [texhax] Typesetting in landscape mode.
Message-ID: <6b823fbc0808042213h6315dbcbs18fff1f3c0432a98@mail.gmail.com>

I have a document that I would like to be entirely in landscape mode
(two columns).  Something like this:

_____________________
| text text | text text |
| text text | text text |
| text text | text text |
| text text | text text |
|__________|__________|

I sure hope this comes out right from gmail... I know postscript can
easily rotate, is there something similar in plain TeX?  It will be on
8.5x11in paper (letter).

I know I can use \vsize and \hsize to control the actual size of the
margins.  I suppose I could output two pages, and then rotate them on
a copy machine?  Maybe something like pstops could take the two pages
and somehow conjoin them rotated?

I saw the FAQs about landscape with LaTex:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html-gamma?label=landscape

But it seemed more for a LaTeX usage.

Thanks for any suggestions.

Not at all ---as Karl Barry said,

-------------
\input eplain
\beginpackages
\usepackage{graphicx}
\endpackages

\includegraphics{<your_graphic>.eps}

\bye
--------------

Also, but maybe less versatile than Eplain,

--------------
\input graphicx.tex

\includegraphics{Figura-III_4.eps}

\bye
---------------

There's the psnup tool from psutils package which can do this (and
much more).  For PDF the equivalent is pdfnup from pdfjam.

Here is a small example of how you can achieve it:

Yes, in the end this is what I ended up doing.  For the archives, I
calculated the magnifcation which would be required to rotate a page
and fit it into 4.25x5.5.  Turns out that its between \magstep2 and
\magstep3, so I'm using:

\magnification=\magstep3

And then using psnup to rotate the pages and fit two onto one 8.5x11
page.  The text is then about the right size.

Thanks for confirming my course of action on this.

I seem to be running into a dead end while trying to typeset a word in
a large font (say cmr20).  The superscript seems to remain in a much
smaller font than I would expect:

\font\bigfont=cmr20

{\bigfont Six$^{th}$}

Doesn't produce what I would think is a proportionally small
superscript.  Also, the superscript seems to show up in the middle of
the x vertically and is not offset above it. Am I missing something
obvious?

Thanks in advance,

Yes :-)  Subscripts are mathematical, and are
taken from the current set of maths fonts,
which are unrelated to the text font that
you have just selected.  Appendix G probably
has all the gory details ...

I belatedly realized I should clarify one thing for the record: Debian
and the FSF define "freedom" differently with respect to various
features of the GNU Free Documentation License.  TeX Live follows the FSF.

http://tug.org/texlive/LICENSE.TL explains in more detail.

Appendix G definitely looks like it might work.  I'm not quite the
TeXnician at this point, so we'll see.  Maybe I can just make my own
macro that creates an hbox that is raised up some proportional value.

On that note, is it possible to change the scale of the font without
changing the font?  For example,

{\bigfont Some text that is one size {\scaledown by .5 text that is smaller}}

I see that TeXbook used something like \tenpoint and \ninepoint to do
this, but it uses some font family magic that I'm not yet a TeXpert
at. Maybe this is the only way though (short of defining all the fonts
that I would need at various sizes).

Or how can I change the default font for the entire document?  I know
I could wrap everything in {\bigfont ...} but there is probably a
better way, right?

Thanks,

Ludwig

Turns out that what I wanted was \raise with a bit of \hbox magic with
a different font.  I think I will revisit Appendix G after I have read
through all the slippery road sign sections.  The following seems to
work fine:

{\bigfont Six$\raise.5ex\hbox{\smallfont th}}$

Maybe I don't even really need mathmode for this but I'm not sure how
to accomplish that just yet.

OK, you look as if you're getting there, but
let me answer your last question, which may
suffice :

Make the first line of your file

	\magnification \magstep 1

(or 2, or 3, or 4, or 5).  The result will be to make
everything bigger by a factor of 1.2 for each numeric
increment.  Of course, things like the page size don't
vary, so you'll need to specify such things using
absolute sizes, as in :

	\hsize = 210 true mm
	\vsize = 29t true mm

and so on.

Sorry, I wasn't explicit enough.  I'm actually already using
\magnification because the final document will be reduced (thanks to
psnup).  What I really meant was... how do I change the default font
(family?) from cmr to say cmtt.  Is it as simple as defining a font
and then placing that at the beginning of the document?

\font\tentt=cmtt10

You should really copy \twelvepoint or some such and make a version
for fully selecting your large font size, including the math setup.

Hi!
 
I don't know how to make the text be displayed like this:
 




Book review 1 
     
This is a big book in every sense of the word. Drawing on more than two decades of scholarship in the field, Joseph Inikori (University of Rochester) has written a provocative, occasionally frustrating, and ultimately convincing monograph on one of the classic issues in our field, the causes of the British Industrial Revolution. 

Book review 2 
     
The culmination of literally decades of careful scholarship, this book is both magnificent and a bit frustrating. The frustrations are not so much due to flaws in the book itself as to some thoughts about what has been left out. 

Book review 3 
     

One of the drawbacks of the standard geographical organization of the historical discipline (broadly defined to include economic history and historical anthropology and sociology) is that scholarship about those regions considered peripheral to Europe and the United States is little read outside of its own subfield. 
 
 
If I type a long line in the review, the next line will be displayed below the "Book review" number.
In html, we use the table tags (with border=0 ). I tried to use table in latex, but my document is in two columns, and the table  seems not work inside two columns.
 
Can anybody help me?Alexandre.

Hi,

Graphs created with gnuplot or R can be easily integrated with LaTeX
documents. And for circuit diagrams, at least in GNU/Linux, one can
use Xfig, see an example here: http://xfig.org/art9.html . Gnuplot and
R are available for Windows, but I am not sure about Xfig. May be you
can try Inkscape or Mayura ?

HTH,

Senthil

I guess the third example exemplifies a "long line" as opposed to
the upper two, but I can't see what makes it "long" ...

... maybe you sometimes insert <br>, sometimes not?
(Like \\ with LaTeX ...)

I think this is not a matter of TeX but of good design.
Your review tables may look fine in the html windows,
but in two-column typesetting a table in a single column
will have ugly interword spaces (or ugly ragged-right style).
A table may span columns if this kind of presenting
information is appropriate, but a review is just an article
like any other in a journal or so.

So I think you really have to choose a different design
for your reviews in two-column documents. You find
examples in almost any journal. Just start a review
with the bibliographical data typeset in more salient
fonts (or colour), with proper vertical spacing.

HTH -- Uwe.

Search the topical index of the TeX Catalogue

     http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html

for "circuit"; you find some packages.

For including graphics, look for any LaTeX introductions,
e.g., do you see the links below?

Message-ID: <6b823fbc0808091521q6a54c868x6bd7b7aed20e522@mail.gmail.com>

So I'm trying to create a custom headline.  Looks something like this:

\magnification=\magstep3
\font\bigfont=cmbx14
\font\littlefont=cmbx6

\def\header#1#2{
\headline={\vbox{\hbox to \hsize{{\bigfont #1} \hfill {\littlefont #2}}
  \vskip 2pt
  \hrule height 2pt}}
}

\header{gary indiana}{gary indiana}

gary indiana

\vfill\eject

\header{Gari Indiana}{Gari Indiana}

Gari Indiana

\bye

The problem is, that the hrule and the text above the hrule don't seem
to want to line the way I want them too do.  I would like the \hrule
to set at exactly the same location on each page, but clearly the
deeper letters are somehow causing some extra spacing to be added.
I've tried using \strut and various other tricks but just can't seem
to align them the way I want.  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Ludwig

With the insertion of \strut just before \bigfont kept the rule

A copy of 'LaTeX Graphics Companion' will be of immense help to you.

circ, circuit-macros, makecirc are packages that can be employed to
create circuit diagrams.

A simple seach for plots at CTAN yielded the following:

epix: Utility for mathematically accurate, camera quality plots and
line figures.
makeplot: Easy plots from Matlab in LaTeX.
metaplot: Plot-manipulation macros for use in Metapost.
pgfplots: Create normal/logarithmic plots in LaTeX.
pst-3dplot: Draw 3d curves and graphs using PSTricks.
pst-func: PSTricks package for plotting mathematical functions.
sagetex: Embed Sage code and plots into LaTeX.
textopo: Annotated membrane protein topology plots.

if using \strut, it should be in the sequence \bigfont\strut so that the
\strut really uses the dimensions from the \bigfont font. Another way is
to hide vertical box dimensions (height, depth) by \smash{}, which stops
\headline to move vertically depending on its contents, e. g.:

\def\header#1#2{%
  \headline={\smash{\vbox{
    \smash{\line{{\bigfont #1}\hfill {\littlefont #2}}}
    \vskip 4pt
    \hrule height 2pt
}}}}

Yes, the insertion of the \strut just before the font worked!  I had
placed it in the wrong place apparently.  This now works properly.

Looks like I spoke too soon.  It also looks like there was more to the
problem than I originally thought; I didn't describe it well enough
either since I didn't describe what was being passed in.

Try the following for the first and second page headers:

\header{gary 25$^{\raise.5ex\hbox{\littlefont th}}$}{gary indiana}

\header{Gari Indiana}{Gari indiana}

While the \strut clearly helped, it hasn't eliminated the spacing
alignment entirely.  I'll look into \smash next.

I guess that's because you haven't set up \strut for \bigfont.  So the
strut you get is for the default 10pt Computer Modern.

Sure? What should be the label?
If the "label" is at least authors + title,
it wouldn't fit one line in twocolumn -
therefore my previous proposal.

However, something like

     \item <bibliographical data>\par <review>

may be nice (but the first par should have special fonts).
Then play with \itemsep and \parsep.

Best,

     Uwe.

ooops, that's nonsense, sorry; this sequence doesn't matter in plain
TeX, as \strut dimensions are fixed (too small to be useful for a 14pt
font). I was thinking LaTeX, where \strut gets its dimensions from the
current baselineskip. So if you want to use a \strut in plain TeX with
other font sizes, you need to make some \mystrut yourself.

The table will span across several pages, so that I would like to use a

Multicols is not working with longtable, and I don't know which is the

\smash is just what was needed.  As you indicated, the \strut in TeX
is  merely a box the size of a standard \baseline which would have to
be redefined for whatever font is in use.

Hi

I am writing to enquire about using bibtex.

Everytime I use to generate reference lists, I get a header/title top
the list as "References". Now I am wondering is there anyway to avoid
this title? And perhaps create a title of my own? or just no title?

I am new to this and am also wondering if this list is the right place

i noticed that bibliography appears in the toc, but does not appear in the 
bookmarks from hyperref.

i gathered that hyperref uses the .out has all the \sections, which end up 
as bookmarks - but \bibliography shouldn't have a \section before it - 
right?

so how can \bibliography become a hyperref bookmark?

You can use the tocbibind package.

I'm ressurecting this thread to mention that the latest TUGboat has an

Message-ID: <A00F10FF-8326-4854-B312-B3C50E5934F6@auckland.ac.nz>


I tried to produce bold slanted sans serif text via

\textbf{\textsl{\textsf{Holy bathroom scales!}}}

and got the warning:

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OT1/cmss/bx/sl' undefined
(Font)              using `OT1/cmss/bx/n' instead on input line 3.

[1] (./test.aux)

LaTeX Font Warning: Some font shapes were not available, defaults  
substituted.

The result was bold sans serif, not slanted.

Questions:

	(1) Is it possible to get bold slanted sans serif?  I.e. can I make the
	right font shapes available?

	(2) If so, how?  I presume I would need to download some (font?)  
file from
	some URL (where?) and then place them in the ``appropriate'' location
	(directory) on my machine (where?).

	If you know the answer to (2), may I humbly beseech you to please be as
	explicit as you possibly can --- I don't understand fonts and the  
sorts of
	files that underlie them worth a damn.  A defect in my character,  
but one
	which I have so far been unable to remedy.

	I am working on an Imac; the results of ``uname -a'' are:

Darwin TURNER-ROLF.local 8.11.1 Darwin Kernel Version 8.11.1: Wed Oct

Hi, everyone,

I'm trying to determine what the absolute bare minimum of files is to
run a LaTeX binary job using packages amstex and amsmath.  The
document class I'm using is article, but I think that all font sizes
would be good to have.

I'm not very familiar with LaTeX, but I'd really appreciate if someone
could tell me what dependencies the latex binary has.  :)

I don't think you need anything more than a base Latex distribution,
since the AMS packages are part of the basic packages.

If for some reason you need less than that, try inserting \listfiles in
your document to get a list of all included files, their versions and
descriptions. It gets output to the screen and log file.

Message-ID: <4FF76AC3-AF34-45FE-8952-5EC4C9F1203A@goyman.com>

Hello,

I'm parsing some xml to produce a pdf document. I have tags inserted  
in a text and I want to replace them with tabulations.
I use the tabbing environment but I'm experiencing 2 problems:

1) When the text before a tab is longer than the distance to the  
corresponding tabstop, the tab still positions itself at this tabstop.  
This results in having the text after the tab to overlap the one before.

\begin{tabbing}
	\hspace{2cm} \= \hspace{2cm} \= \hspace{2cm} \= \hspace{2cm} \=  
\hspace{2cm} \= \kill
	This text is much longer than 2cm\>And this one will be partly  
overlapping the first one
\end{tabbing}

2) There is no word wrapping when the text reaches the right margin.

Does anyone know a way to do this?

Hi,

I'm an amateur TeXlive user and would be happy if
anyone could answer this basic question. I have to
translate plain tex documents, and am getting
"undefined control sequence" errors for the following commands:

  \titlepage
  \pagewidth
  \pageheight
  \killpt
  \tenpoint

I could not find anything in the documents, and commands
like \titlepage should be in the tex standard classes, so
what am I missing and how to correct this error? I'm using
a current texlive installation with all optional texlive debian
packages already installed, including texlive-plain-*.

$ tex --version
TeX 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.6)
kpathsea version 3.5.6

Thank you!

There's no such thing as "TeX standard classes", there's just a single
macro file plain.tex.  You can see for yourself that it doesn't define
any of the above macros.

> so what am I missing and how to correct this error?

You have to find the additional macro file(s) your document is using.
Look for \input <filename> command in the document and check the file
<filename> (and do this recursively).  It's also possible that a
generated format is used, but in that case you'd not be calling TeX as
"tex" but as some other command (like "latex") or with additional
command line arguments.

HTH,
Oleg

Hey, you did not tell me that you do use dvipdf to convert dvi into
pdf.  In that case, you will seldom succeed unless you use the correct
backend driver, 'dvipdf' or dvipdfm' or dvipdfmx' as the case may be
instead of 'dvips.

Happy TeXing and best regards

I get hyperlinks in my PDF files using the \htmladdnormallink{}{}
command, made available by \usepackage{html}, as documented at
<http://www-texdev.ics.mq.edu.au/l2h/docs/manual/Hnode1_ct.html#addnormlink>.
I generate the PDF using the command dvipdf, which may or may not be
the same as dvi2pdf.

The workaround is simple.  The only thing I had to do was to update the 
installation (MikTex).  Now it works perfect.  Sorry for the posting.

Message-ID: <1896.1219148290@as220.org>


Hi all:

Is there a way to typeset a paragraph so that the text of the entire
first line or two is in a larger font than the succeeding lines?  You
sometimes see this effect in newspapers and magazine typesetting.
Browsing CTAN hasn't really helped, since I don't know what to call
this.  Any thoughts?

Thanks

Donald Arseneau's magaz.sty has a feature for that:

http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=magaz

It works quite well --- I used it in an HS phonebook linead  
typesetting system we've developed here at work.

Message-ID: <3b2ddd940808190950o1c21bf9fp757d9498d104dc3f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I am new to using thebibliography environment for creating reference
lists. I am trying to create a reference list with added
annotations/labels that help me sort and classifythe entries. So the
reference list should look something like this:

[1] Entry one....

[2] Entry two....

Label1

[3] Entry three....

[4] Entry four....

[5] Entry five....

Label 2

[6] Entry six....

and so on. I thought of breaking up the list but I need a continuously
numbered reference list (with labels in the middle). Is there any
straight forward way of doing this? I have been trying to look at the
documentation of thebibliography environment but doesnt help much.

I tried typing in the text in between \bibitem entries but it gives me
labels indented much further to the right, could I align them somehow
with the numbers [1], [2],...?

Thanks

Siraj

Please remember that even the most advanced LaTeX users started as  
complete newbies.

First, you need a TeX & friends distribution, like TeXLive, MacTeX or  
MikTeX: see in http://www.tug.org/ the software section as well as  
``Gettiing started''.

See also The not so Short Introduction to LaTeX (in various languages):

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/

If you already have a TeX et al. distro, then

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{a4wide}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage[numbers]{natbib}
\usepackage[portuges]{babel}
\begin{document}

<Your text>

\end{document}

Best,

Axel

I am trying to put a footnote on a section heading without putting it into 
the page header.  If I don't use \protect\footnote, I get an error (extra 
} error) and if do \protect it, I get a strange result.  If the original 
footnote number is 1, then the header has a superscript 2, followed by an 
online 1, neither of which is wanted.  The section titles are separated 
from the text, so it will not do to put the footnote after the heading.

I have tried a couple of different searches on CTAN with no results.

Subject: [texhax] Bug in plainnat.bst?
Message-ID: <20080823102920.GA19088@netsoc.tcd.ie>

Hi,

I am using the crossref feature of bibtex to cross-reference articles in
conference proceedings. The problem starts when those proceedings do not have
an editor; for example:

  @inproceedings{hage:usageanalysis,
   crossref = {ICFP07},
   author   = {Jurriaan Hage and Stefan Holdermans and Arie Middelkoop},
   title    = {A generic usage analysis with subeffect qualifiers},
   pages    = {235--246},
  }
  
  @proceedings{ICFP07,
   title     = {ICFP '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGPLAN international conference on Functional programming},
   booktitle = {ICFP '07: Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGPLAN international conference on Functional programming},
   year      = {2007},
   publisher = {ACM},
   key       = {ICFP07},
  }

(Since ACM proceedings do not have editors, the most logical key to use for
cross-referencing is the mnemonic for the conference.)

With the plainnat.bst style, the entry for hage:usageanalysis will be formatted
as

  Jurriaan Hage, Stefan Holdermans and Arie Middelkoop. A generic usage
  analysis with subeffect qualifiers. In ICFP07 ICFP07, pages 235--246.

Note the double occurrence of the key. In plainnat.bst, this is caused by the
line marked by the arrow in:

  FUNCTION {format.incoll.inproc.crossref}
  { editor empty$
    editor field.or.null author field.or.null =
    or
      { key empty$
          { booktitle empty$
              { "need editor, key, or booktitle for " cite$ * " to crossref " *
                crossref * warning$
                ""
              }
              { "In \emph{" booktitle * "}" * }
            if$
          }
          { "In " key * }    <--------------
        if$
      }
      { "In " }
    if$
    " \citet{" * crossref * "}" *
  }

Since that line outputs the key, which is then *again* output by the citet at
the very end, the key is duplicated in the output. I think this line should be
modified to just

          { "In " } 

unless perhaps I am abusing the entries in some way.

It would be a lot easier for you to use the caption package. It lets  
you modify every element of captions for both tables and figures.  
Chances are you already have it; so

texdoc caption

If you don't,

Well ---that works with a 2007 distribution; if you're using TeX Live  
2008,

texdoc caption-eng

(in TL 2008 ` texdoc caption ' produces the package documentation; `  
texdoc caption-eng ' opens the user documentation in English).

that is the wrong way to do it. Use the caption package instead. 
Everything is explained in the caption package manual.

Subject: [texhax] Vertical leaders alignment / Actual line width
Message-ID: <BAY104-W396CF58C493EE368A4EBEAB3610@phx.gbl>


Hi, I'm trying to format chapter titles in a frame, where the title text is aligned bottom-right, and where the bottom line of the frame is vertically aligned with the baseline (thus the title text) and also ends right before the text startes, so it looks something  like this:
_________________
|                            |
|_____chapter name|

If anyone is familiar with the "Glenn" style in the fncychap package, this looks basically the same...
Anyway, I got up to that point, the trouble is when the text of the chapter title doesn't fit on one line. Ideally, I would want it to look like this:
__________________
|                             |
| A very long chapter|
|      title which spans|
|______several lines|

I got as far as putting it (right-aligned) in a parbox, and adjusting the vertical lengths. The trouble is with the bottom horizonal line: I give the maximum length for par-width, so doing it with rule+hfill+parbox like with single lines results in a zero-length rule, because the parbox takes up all the width. I checked out the pbox package, but it doesn't give me the width of the last line which is the one I'm interested in, and which is mostly the shortest.

I have several thoughts but I'm not exactly sure whether they make sense or how to implement them:
- If I could only find out the actual width of the last line, I could manually set the width of the bottom rule. But, like I said, pbox didn't calculate that.
- One could integrate the bottom line INSIDE the parbox, like with leaders or something. It's the closest I got, but then it's aligned with the first par line of course. Is there a way to indicate the vertical alignment of the leaders, so I could say it should point to the bottom line?
- One idea is to manually separate the lines of the parbox, but I'm not sure how, and is prob way difficult and not very clean...
- I tried setting the parbox first, vskipping and hskipping back to where the bottom line should start, and then rule+fill, but of course it then ignores the parbox altogether and goes the whole textwidth (right acros the bottom line).
- I thought maybe a white hrule or underline or something in the bottom of the parbox (are white chars processed at all or just ignored? Not even sure...) to overwrite the bottom rule where the bottom text is ("several lines"), but again not sure how...


ANY ideas are appreciated!!
Thanks in advance.

Hello,

I hope you can help me. I have a
problem with long table. When I insert picture in long table there is
a white space at the bottom of the picture. When I use a tabular I
repair this with \vspace{} , but this doesn't work in long table.

Thank you for your help.

What I would like to know is why you want to place pictures in tables
-- just curious.

And: please post a minimal example!

    \renewcommand{\tablename}{\textbf{Table}}% Forces Table into bold
    Does the first bit right but how do I get the Table number in bold?

I concur with the other responses that using the caption package (and I
bet there are other packages too) is the best idea.  But if for some
reason you cannot or do not want to do that, with some trepidation, I
will post what we do in tugboat.dtx:

\def\fnum at figure{{\small \bf \figurename\nobreakspace\thefigure}}
\def\fnum at table{{\small \bf \tablename\nobreakspace\thetable}}

(We make further changes in \@makecaption to propagate the \small size,
but anyway ...)

Best,
karl

P.S. To use the above, you have to be in a context where @ is a letter.
If you didn't already know that, or don't know what that means, please
ignore this post entirely :).

Sorry for jumping in the middle. Has TeXLive 2008 been released? What I
see is an iso from Dec 2, 2007.

I hope someone can help me with the following problem:
I want to make a table with two columns. in the first column is a

Sorry if this is a silly question...I truly have been looking everywhere I know to look for an answer.  I've been using LaTex for a few months and am now trying to go beyond what I usually use it for.

Here's what I've got:

\documentclass[12pt]{book}

\usepackage[margin=.75in]{geometry}
\setlength{\parindent}{0in}

\frontmatter
\title{Advanced Placement Calculus}
\author{S. Jonak\\Kirkwood High School}
\date{}
\maketitle \tableofcontents
\mainmatter
\chapter{Precalculus Review}
\section{Functions and their Graphs}

What I'm getting is a blank page immediately after my title page with roman numeral ii in the header, then my table of contents, then another blank page with roman numeral iv and then finally a page with Chapter 1 on it.

What is causing the blank pages?  Can I get rid of them?
Any help is greatly appreciated!

Dear TUG:

My name is Kazuo Yamazaki. I am a math student at Stanford University. I am a typical math student type who has dove into more theoretical side of studies and spent most of my days on blackboard rather than on computer. Consequently, I have had much trouble understanding how to use LaTeX. I really want to understand how to use this program; I have recently written a research paper with a professor and he prefers that I write the draft using LaTeX. I have already tried for a few days to understand how to use it and already ran into troubles. I wonder if I could e-mail you questions periodically and obtain help from you with promise to reply to my questions in a day, or as soon as possible, with enough detail for a beginner like myself to be able to understand. If such request requires that I become a member of TUG, please feel free to inform me as I will be more than happy to. 

Below I typed the questions that I already have so you get an idea of what kind of questions to expect from me:

I went to the CTAN main webpage listed below:

http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html

and downloaded the proTeXt. The web page explained that it has "full TeX system, including LaTeX." But where is LaTeX? After the download was complete, I opened the folder and found the following folders inside:

addons, combobox-2.3, doc, gsv, Install, MiKTeX, Sources, TeXnicCenter, unsupported

I understand that MiKTeX and TeXnicCenter are important features but they are different from LaTeX, aren't they? Assuming MiKTeX and TeXnicCenter are not LaTeX, only thing I could guess after hours of banging my head was that inside the folder "unsupported," there was "texmakerwin32_install" which I downloaded and obtained bunch of pictures and documents and one feature entitled "texmaker." Is that the LaTeX? But if it is LaTex, why, when I click on a button LATEX or PDFLAT, it says "Can't detect the file name"? What does that even mean? 

I have a similar problem with TeXnicCenter. Why, when I try to view output via F5, does it say "Cannot execute the command"?

If you could help me, I would really really appreciate it. Otherwise, please advise me to somewhere else where I could get help.

I look forward to hearing from you.

That's how the book class should work: every chapter should begin at  
odd numbered pages; you can use the report class or

I would suggest

\documentclass[12pt,oneside,openany]{memoir}

which is IMHO much better for books (highly customizable)

Truth is I haven't used memoir yet (but I've read the amazing manual).

Thank you.

You're professor is quite right, and you won't regret learning LaTeX.  
Please download Prof. Gr?tzer's Short Course in

http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Math_into_LaTeX-4/

and start by reading Appendix A. You can say MiKTeX is both a  
distribution of TeX and friends (LaTeX, etc.) as well as the program  
that installs said distribution.

Then read ``The not so Short Introduction to LaTeX'':

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/

Feel free to post your questions here ---this is a mailing list where  
users try to help other users.

And if you can join TUG, it would be great.


Best regards,

Axel

Hi Kazuo,

Seems you need to take a step back to the beginning, rather than  
trying to start in the middle.

Have a look at these tutorials http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/ 
latex/. They may help in understanding the relationship between LaTeX  
and the various editors that exist.
Otherwise the Not So Short Intro here, http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/ 
, is deemed to be a good introduction for those that prefer to do  
stuff offline. Otherwise, buy George Gratzer's new More Math Into  
LaTeX book, which is targetted at people in your position (I see it is  
available from Amazon and that there is Kindle version of it, pretty  
cool).

Cheers
Alan

Prof. Gr?tzer's Short Course, which I recommended:

http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Math_into_LaTeX-4/

is, let's say, the free part of ``More Math Into LaTeX'' (I still have  
*and use* the excellent third edition and bought a copy of the fourth  
ed. for a nephew), and Appendix A are instructions for installing TeX  
et al. on Windows and Mac.

Now ---I'm curious ---I don't know Kindle, but do you know or does  
someone know how does it look a LaTeX book on Kindle? Or scientific  
books in general?


Best,

Axel

In your directory of the document, where you run it by latex
and bibtex exists a file file.bbl

Prof. Voss has been kind to my fellows (I'm a copy-editor myself) --- 
how come they can't open your .bib file? It's a plain text file, and  
if you make it right, it looks something like this

@BOOK{Kurzweil90,
    AUTHOR = {Raymond Kurzweil},
    ADDRESS = {Cambridge, Massachusetts},
    KEY = {Kurzweil, 1990},
    PUBLISHER = {MIT Press},
    TITLE = {The Age of Intelligent Machines},
    YEAR = {1990}
}

and so on.

When you run BibTeX it reads your .bib file and, following  
instructions from a .bst (bibliography style) file it outputs a .bbl  
file, which LaTeX reads to typeset your bibliography. The three are  
different things.

Once you have a .bib file with your references as above (which can  
have any name, like prasad-biblio.bib), you tell LaTeX, in your  
preamble, which bibliography package to use; v.gr.,

\usepackage[round]{natbib}

then, in your document, where the bibliography should appear, you put,  
for example,

\bibliography{prasad-biblio}%
\bibliographystyle{plainnat}

The Natbib documentation tells you to put \bibliographystyle{xxxx}  
just after \begin{document}. For me, it has worked as above. Read the  
excellent Natbib documentation:

texdoc natbib

at your terminal or Command Prompt. Your .bib file doesn't have to  
have the same title as your LaTeX document (you can reuse it for all  
your papers); but the .bbl file will have the same name as your  
document.tex.

Best,

Axel

Consider the file

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
$A\cup \lim(B)$
\end{document}

(which could as well be a plain document).  When composed and viewed, the 
\cup comes much closer to the A than to the lim.  According to the TeXbook 
(p. 170 in the 17th printing), the spacing between a mathbin and either a 
mathord or a mathop and vice versa is supposed to be the same 2mu.  I 
first noticed this on a tight line, where the \cup butted right against 
the \lim while there was still space between the A and the \cup.  Sure I 
could insert the space by hand, but I would like to know why this is so 
oddly spaced and can anything systematic be done about it?  Incidentally, 
adding italic correction has no effect.

Here both the diagnostics (see below) and my eyes/screen with \Huge
and 400% set, show equal spacing.

If you are familiar with list and box listings then something like the
following will enable you to see in the lofg file exactly what is
getting into the 'math list' and the glue in the box thus created.

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\Huge
$A\cup \lim(B) \showboxdepth 1000
\showlists$

\showboxdepth 100
\showboxbreadth 100
