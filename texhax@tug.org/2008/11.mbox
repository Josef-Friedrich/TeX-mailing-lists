Message-ID: <55c10a5f0810311758k14639f45k9bee6b44a3533924@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've upgraded from TeXLive 2007 to TeXLive 2008 recently, since I'd
been having trouble with beamer+hyperref+dvipdfmx. Needless to say,
the diagnostic messages on the command line and in the .log file have always
been a tremendous help: what package versions are being used, what config
config files are being loaded, etc.

When the recent upgrade didn't fully solve the problem, i naturally
tried looking
at the .log file ... only to find out that all but font related
diagnostics have disappeared!!
Where once beamer, pgf, hyperref, used to leave behind a long trail,
now there's practically
nothing useful.

Has some new option been added to LaTeX to turn on the messages?
some settings via the new tlmgr perhaps? Please help.....

While I'm at it, here's the trouble i'm having. The document (slides
really) compiles fine,
but  during dvi -> pdf via dvipdfmx, i see quite a few of the following blocks:

** WARNING ** Can't begin an annotation when one is pending.
** WARNING ** Interpreting special command bann (pdf:) failed.
** WARNING ** >> at page="18" position="(72.816, 79.1588)" (in PDF)

** WARNING ** Interpreting special command eann (pdf:) failed.
** WARNING ** >> at page="18" position="(80.1245, 77.1663)" (in PDF)

Searching on the web didn't return anything useful, maybe someone can
shed light on the issue.

Thanks a lot,
Ritesh

Dear Herbert,

I have also provided a solution to the problem (with \newcommand
statement), have you read the whole letter? The focus of my question was
rather that why it is not possible to use the \usebox command inside
\label?

Because a label is just an identifier. It's just a sequence of
characters (in the input sense, not in the sense of characters that get
printed), while a box is typeset text (or something that will be
typeset). It contains the glyphs to be printed, and possibly glue,
kerns, and other special features.

I'm sure someone can come up with a more technical (or texnical)
explanation, but that is the idea.

I missed (or more correctly deleted) the beginning of this discussion,
but I would point to two things. Firstly, here's the entry for \label
resulting from typing info latex into my linux console and navigating to
the \label command:

==============
`\label{key}'

   A `\label' command appearing in ordinary text assigns to the `key'
the number of the current sectional unit; one appearing inside a
numbered environment assigns that number to the `key'.

   A `key' can consist of any sequence of letters, digits, or
punctuation characters.  Upper and lowercase letters are different.

...
===============

Secondly, and more importantly, \label doesn't typeset anything, it sets
up the key for referencing, e.g.,

\ref{key}  will produce the section number (or enumeration)
corresponding to the location of the \label{key} command, and
\pageref{key} will produce the number of the page where the \label
command appears. Latex does this by looking up "key" in the aux file and
finding the corresponding numbers. The aux file is pure text. There's no
way to put a box there, and even if there were, how would it be able to
look up the contents of a box, which could contain graphics, picture
environments, minipages, or anything else?

Dear Sir/Madam,

Hi, my name is Nader and I'm a beginner of typesetting tool Tex. I managed
to get Tex up and running on Xp fairly easily but had problem to get it up
and running on Vista which eventually I did. now I have only one problem.
the problem is that when I start the process in Dos Prompt, the CMD box
shows that the machine is thinking and this takes at least 1-2 minutes each
time I run it to fix a word! and I have to run Tex thousands of times to get
the scripture text right. in Xp there is no delay and the process is very
fast. is there any way we can omit this delay in Vista?

I would be grateful if you could help me with this or at least put me in
touch with some one who might be able to help me with this.

Best Regards,
Nader Fard

    looking at the .log file ... only to find out that all but font
    related diagnostics have disappeared!!  Where once beamer, pgf,
    hyperref, used to leave behind a long trail, now there's practically
    nothing useful.

    Has some new option been added to LaTeX to turn on the messages?
    some settings via the new tlmgr perhaps? Please help.....

I doubt anything has changed in LaTeX itself in this regard, and tlmgr
has nothing to do with what packages actually do.

So I suspect that beamer/pgf/hyperref themselves are logging
differently.  I cannot say for sure without diffing the sources, and I'm
not up for that right now.  I certainly agree logging is useful and that
it's too bad the current versions do less of it.

    While I'm at it, here's the trouble i'm having. 

It could be a bug in the 08 dvipdfmx.  You could try copying the TL'07
version into TL'08 tree (e.g., as "dvipdfmx07") and see if it works.
It's possible some of its support file changes will cause the 07 binary
to fail in the 08 tree, but I doubt it.  Could be worth a try if you
just want to get your slides out.

In any case, if you send the .tex+.dvi (minimal examples always
appreciated, of course) to the dvipdfmx bug address
(dvipdfmx at project.ktug.or.kr), the authors might be able to find a fix.

Best,
Karl

$AB\I L$

If its argument is a single character, \mathop centers it 
to with respect to the math-axis.

You can define

\newcommand\I{\mathop{\kern0pt I}

to avoid this.

Well, you live and learn.  I never knew that.  I should have checked out 
\mathop in the TeXBook.

If you have a single-letter mathop it gets vertically centered unless you 
put it in a box.  For example, I normally define the expectation operator 
by

\newcommand{\expect}{\mathop{\mbox{$\mathbb E$}}\nolimits}

Sorry, the name isn't stored anywhere by default 
(apart from job.aux or job.toc where it won't be easier to get from). 
A natural way getting it may be the nameref package 
(belonging to hyperref, I think).

Hello.  A journal requires an unusual referencing scheme.  They want

citations in the reference section.  An example:

Einstein defended the theory of special relativity [1].  He also blah 
blah...

I'm trying to use some combination of footnotes and bibtex, but can't seem 
to get the two to work together.

I'm using the most current version of latex (pdflatex, if it matters), 
running ubuntu stable.

I'm sorry if this is covered in a faq, but it's a bit difficult to provide 
proper search terms, without also uncovering irrelevant information.

Thanks for your help.

This is not that unusual ... it is in fact widely used in
science/engineering
journals.  The simplest approach is not to bother with bibtex but simply
use

relativity \cite{key}. ...

The place where I work is such that everybody else uses (yeeuuuchhhh)  
MS Word.
Just now we were given a new collection of fonts (apparently  
proprietary to
the University of Auckland; sigh; I despair ...) that are required/ 
recommended
by the University style guide.

The font files have been placed in ~/Library/Fonts and in /Library/ 
Fonts on my IMac;
they have names like

	GroteskMacronOT-Reg.otf

and the ``file'' command says they are ``OpenType font data''.

Is it possible to use such fonts in LaTeX?  If so, can someone please  
give me
a (fairly explicit) recipe as to how to do so?   Said recipe would  
(said he,
hopefully) include answers to:

	* what font files do I need to create? (*.pk things? *.tfm things?)
	* how do I create them?
	* once they're created, where should I put them?
	* ***then*** what do I do?  I.e. what incantations do I need to
	  put into my *.tex file in order to invoke the use of these fonts?

I don't understand, and never have understood, fonts and font files  
properly,
so please make your explanations, if you are kind enough to provide  
them, as
simple-minded as possible.

Undying gratitude, 'n' stuff like that.

	cheers,

I would suggest using xelatex (or LuaTeX).

http://scripts.sil.org/xetex

for the latter.

Read the fontspec documentation and you should be good to go.

Hi,

I just installed MikTeX 2.7 and TeXnicCenter.  When I tried to compile a 
very simple trial .tex file into DVI and PDF, an error occurs.  It says 
"Windows API error 2: The system cannot find the file specified.".  When 
I look at the log, basically Latex is not generating .aux file.

Right now the path Latex=>DVI is C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 
2.7\miktex\bin\latex.exe, I tried yap.exe, but it doesn't work.

I hope that I can get some help from you.  It seems to me I just missed 
a correct path.  Thank you very much!

are you sure that your document actually compiles?

Does something as simple as

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
hello world
\end{document}

work?

Most editors run in a mode that ignores errors, but if there is a fatal 
error the dvi is not created, and thus Yap cannot find it.

Hmm, I'm not a MikTeX og TeXnicCenter user, but try the following

rebuild the formats, aka. start -> programs -> MikTeX 2.7 -> settings 
there is a button somewhere to rebuild the formats

In two-column format, LaTeX insists on putting the caption in the second
column when the figure falls in the first one.  Even if I leave plenty of
space, it's just filled up with other material from the document.  How can
I make all of this stick together (besides dropping the [h]) ?

Hi,

I am trying to create a link to my publication as follows
\href{http://link.to.paper}{Paper Title}

I am generating a pdf using latex->dvips->ps2pdf. Everything is
working fine, except that my paper title runs over the right margin
since the link text is not broken across lines (
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=breaklinks ). I tried
the following without success

(a) using breaklines=true for hyperref. This breaks the text but the
links are no more active.

(b) using breakurl package. But, since I am using \href (and not \url)
I don't know how to instruct breakurl to break the text of \href
command.


Is there any way I am break the text while still having the link active.


Thanks,
Sumit

Hi,

I have an issue with using enumitem package which is best explained
with this example.

\documentclass[oneside, 10pt, letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage{enumitem}

\begin{document}

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
    \item[ITEM 1]
      \begin{description}
        \item [Middle Item] part of a list
      \end{description}
    \item[ITEM 2]  With only plain text

\end{description}
\end{document}

For some unfathomable reason ITEM 2 is displayed but ITEM 1 isn't. I
have found that if a \item[] is immediately followed by a list the
label is missing.


Thanks

This is certainly not standard behaviour.  Alas, as is often the case, you
provide no minimal example nor do you mention what class or packages you are
using; my crystal ball's at the polishers right so I'm afraid I can't help.

Looks like it might of the creepy-crawly variety: the best thing is to try

I can't reproduce this. Make an example.

Message-ID: <001201c940c1$eaf7bd60$3c0fa8c0@elamnet.elam.com>

Dear Friends,

 

One of my friends who does some programming for our websites found the
solution for the delay in vista. I tried it and it works very well. No
delays any more ;p) could you please post these lines on to your websites
and mailing lists for those who might bump in to this problem? Here are the
short lines:

 

 

 

hi there, found a solution! :)

man, that was a mind blowing thing

the solution is pretty simple:

1. You need to move one of the fonts from C:\Windows\Fonts to Desktop

2. Delete it from C:\Windows\Fonts

3. Drag it back from Desktop into Fonts

4. Run fc-cache, the "Failed to write cache" message should disappear and
xetex should run properly

 

Basically, the modified timestamp on the Windows Fonts needs to be brought
up-to-date for fc-cache to work

in Linux it is easier to modify it, because you have a "touch" command but
in Windows, you need to use the solution above

btw, don't move an essential font (e.g. Arial), move a more obscure one,
like "Vladimir Script"

hope this works for you,

 

 

Thanks

Nader

this is a know issue in enumitem which is even mentioned in the enumitem

You can also use John Owen's otfinst script to get opentype in LaTeX:

http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/code/otfinst/

It's not that complicated (and works nicely if you can't switch to XeTeX).

Hi,

I'm a long time LaTeX "user", but I do not have much experience with
software installation.

I'm running Leopard on a MacPro with tc shell. I installed the MacTEX
package from CTAN, and TeXShop is working.

When I try to run LaTeX from the command line, I get "latex: Command not
found."  I'm guessing that my PATH needs to be modified. I made a .cshrc
file, but I'm not sure what to put in it.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Crystal

Indeed, MacTeX sets the path for bash, the current default shell in  
Mac OS X. You can try setting the path for /usr/texbin

But, better yet, ask in the TeX on Mac OS mailing list:

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

(server not responding right now)

Richard Koch, MacTeX maintainer, is a regular in that mailing list.

L.S.,

The Dutch TeX Language User Group NTG and the ConTeXt task force are
pleased to invite you to the combined EuroTeX 2009 conference and
third international ConTeXt meeting:

    August 24--28, 2009
    Netherlands Defence College (NDC), The Hague
    The Netherlands

See the website for more information and future updates

    http://www.ntg.nl/EuroTeX2009


Call for Papers
===============

As usual, proposals for presentations and workshops are welcomed on
just about any topic of interest to \TeX\ users, but the conference
focus will be on

    Educational uses of TeX

such as manuals, courseware and college presentations, so we
especially welcome proposals on subjects in those fields.

    http://www.ntg.nl/EuroTeX2009/programme.html


Registration
============

The conference is made possible by the Netherlands Defence Academy
(NLDA) that graciously invited us to their facilities, including the
on-site hotel, thereby allowing a very competitive conference fee.

Well, this will be a case of the blind leading the blind, but ....

I am perforce using a Mac, and don't really understand OS X --- I  
treat the
system as being Unix as much as I can.  I do have latex working, but.

When I type ``which latex'' I get /usr/texbin/latex, so /usr/texbin  
has to
be in my path; and it is.  When I type echo $path I get

/sw/bin /sw/sbin /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/ 
texbin /Users/rturner/.bin . /usr/X11R6/bin

I didn't do anything to get /usr/texbin into my path (i.e. there's no  
reference to it
in my .cshrc) --- it just seems to be there.  If it isn't there for  
you, try adding it
to your path in your .cshrc.

HTH.

I read in

and my /private/etc/csh.login, as set by MacTeX, without any

You'll want to use an older setup which has been deprecated.

Go to:

http://ii2.sourceforge.net/

and review.

Download:
ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/comp/macosx/II2-Jaguar-Complete.dmg

and install that.

If at all possible, you really should upgrade (says the guy whose  
wife's PowerBook is still on 10.2.8).

Hi,
 
Thanks for reading my mail. I am sitting and writing a thesis in LaTeX. I got stuck when I try to use \includegraphics for my .eps figures. When I compile the document to pdf the figures are not shown. I have tryed both pdflatex and latex, dvipdfmx. It is just a white box with a black border containing the file name shown. I am using \usepackage{graphicx} in the preamble. The thing is that I am using the \documentclass ua-thesis.cls and that is the problem. When I change to \documentclass book the figures are shown correctly (but the thesis looks ugly).
 
It shold be some additional code in the .cls file but I dont understand how I should write that code.
 
I am very thankful for all help I can get.
 
best regards

I thought ua-thesis executed the draft option by default, but it seems  
I'm wrong; just

\documentclass{ua-thesis}
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}

is enough to see the included graphics ---only be sure not to use the  
draft option; that is,

\documentclass[draft]{ua-thesis}
                  ^
                  |
be sure not to use it like this.

Can't the confinement to ua-thesis be dropped, and \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
suffices to see the graphics? At least don't call any draft option?

Hello,

I am exporting Web of Science references into a .bib files which is
admittedly a fantastic feature. My only issue is that frequently W.O.S.
exports the citation in entirely capital letters. This is obviously not
ideal. Does anyone know if there is any way to fix this? Or am I stuck
manually fixing each citation before using it? I use Texmaker with Ubuntu

Right. First, I thought that ua-thesis was calling the draft option by  
default, so an explicit final option was necessary; but it turns out I  
was wrong ---ua-thesis doesn't call draft option *and* the final  
options adds things you really don't want, unless you're actually  
presenting your work to the University of Arizona.

The thing is ua-tesis is old ---1997, a time of slower processors, and  
the examples you find tell you to use the draft option, which back  
then I think saved a lot of processing time. So maybe Per was  
typesetting with the draft option on, and that's why his graphics  
didn't show up.

Best,

Axel

On the contrary, the [draft] option chewed up *more* processor time
due to its high tolerance value, so checking more breakpoints in paragraphs.

The [final] option produces overfull boxes in paragraphs, which should 
be absolutely forbidden in a final version.

Use the ulem package and the \sout command. See

If strikethrough is used the way you said all {\em ...} commands must  
be replaced by {\it ...}. Otherwise, what is within {\em ...} will be

Regarding Knuth's metaphors, I'm quite familar with TeX's gullet and
stomach as described in The TeXbook.  Nevertheless, I'm still
wondering where the dvi files come from.

Dear Mr. Mousavi,

Salam. I feel that folks at MikTex.org, TexHax, Xetex, and TUG are better
prepared to address your question. There certainly are a huge library of
codes and samples that they will refer you to which will make developing the
style a whole lot easier. It is my experience that these lists are very
active and you will hear from them promptly. On the other hand it may not be
as easy to get useful information from Parsi-Tex developers.

I have listed some useful mailing list addresses  at the bottom of this
email for your convenience. I am sorry that I was not of much help. Good
luck.

Hello:

   I am using colorbox in conjunction with a fancyvrb environment. I am
trying to control the width of the box. The default is the length of the
longest line placed in the box, but I want it to be uniform without
putting in dummy long lines. Here is a sketch of my code:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{myv}

\colorbox{ltgrey} {\BUseVerbatim {myv} }

Hi,

Is it possible to instruct latex to print only the messages from
\typeout or \listfiles (or in short only from latex commands) and not
print any other compiler messages? I was unable to find any such
option.

Is there any package which looks if equation \label{mylabel} is
referred and if not treats it as {equation*}

May be there is script doing this?

foo.aux stores label info but where is stored info about references
(except foo.tex)?

Thank you in advance

Use \tabulary instead of \begin{tabulary} and \endtabulary instead of
\end{tabulary}.

in the latest version you can even tell it if there are some equations 
that are not refered to but who you whould like to be numbered anyway.

Hi,
I doubt that it is possible.  LaTeX is a macro package based on TeX
primitives.  So TeX (the program) is actually not aware about LaTeX.

But if you really need this behavior you can switch to \batchmode at
the beginning and then temporarily to \errorstopmode whenever you want
to print something to screen.

Not very convenient but I have no better idea.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hello All,

I cant' seem to figure out how to cite a website using Bibtex. So far I have
tried this (with \usepackage{url}:

 @MISC{UNBC2008,

AUTHOR = "UNBC",

TITLE = "Natural Resources and Environmental Studies Graduate Program",

MONTH = "November",

YEAR = {2008},

NOTE = "\url{http://www.unbc.ca/nres/grad_overview.html}"


And this:



@MISC{UNBC2008,

AUTHOR = "UNBC",

TITLE = "Natural Resources and Environmental Studies Graduate Program",

MONTH = "November",

YEAR = {2008},

NOTE = "\texttt{http://www.unbc.ca/nres/grad_overview.html}"


Any ideas on the proper way to do this? I am using APA style. Sorry if this
is quite simple.

Hi Sam,

You can use the url field, as in:

@article{Alter2005,
	Author = {Steven Alter},
	Title = {Architecture of {S}ysperanto: A Model-Based Ontology of the  
\textsc{is} Field},
	Journal = {Communications of the {A}ssociation for {I}nformation  
{S}ystems},
	Year = {2005},
	Month = {January},
	Volume = {15},
	Number = {1},
	lastChecked = {16 April, 2008},
	url = {www.stevenalter.com/} }

If you are using APAcite I would suggest reading the documentation. It  
explains how to handle urls well. If you are using TeXLive you should  
be able to use texdoc apacite in a terminal window. Otherwise it is  
available from your local ctan mirror.

I actually find the Wikipedia article on BibTeX (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX)  a useful reference on entry types. It
includes the required and optional fields for common style files. And of
course, you can look at the style file yourself to see the supported fields.
I had to write my own style file for my senior design class last year, and
boy did I get a crash course in stacks! But in terms of getting your bib to
look just right, there's nothing better.

Cheers,

I would have suspected these to work. Do you get any errors/warnings 
from bibtex? And could you provide a full minimal example? both a 
minimal document, so that we can see which bibstyle you are using and a 
sample bibfile, because the entries above are not complete.

Hi,

I would like to use "twocolumn" option for my Hebrew and other Semitic 
Bible editions (e.g. Syriac, Aramaic etc) which are written right-to-left, 
but the problem of "twocolumn" is that it starts from the left column 
whereas I need it to start the page from the right column.

Is there any way to tell XeLaTeX to do this? I looked at the "*dblcolumn* 
routines in base/latex.ltx but cannot figure out how to do this.

Kind regards
Tigran

It is quite easy.  Copy out the \@outputdblcol definition from latex.ltx,
and put it in a .sty (or .cls) file, then, in your copy, exchange the two
lines
                             \box\@leftcolumn \hss}%
and
                             \box\@outputbox \hss}%


You should also declare \@mparswitchtrue.


Correction on my simple exchange above!  I realize that will put
the auxiliary file entries in the wrong order, so, for example, 
bibTeX may get the numbering wrong, and toc entries will be out
of order.

A more thorough redefinition (again, untested) is (part of
\@outputdblcol)

   \setbox\@outputbox \vbox {%
                         \hb at xt@\textwidth {%
                           \kern\textwidth \kern-\columnwidth  %**
                           \hb at xt@\columnwidth {%
                             \box\@leftcolumn \hss}%
                           \kern-\textwidth %**
                           \hfil
                           {\normalcolor\vrule \@width\columnseprule}%
                           \hfil
                           \kern-\textwidth  %**
                           \hb at xt@\columnwidth {%
                             \box\@outputbox \hss}%
                           \kern-\columnwidth \kern\textwidth %**
                                             }%
                              }%
    \@combinedblfloats


(All repositioning is done with \kern and marked with %**)

Hello, Thanks for reading my mail.

It concerns intern PDF links.

When I have various levels of titles without numbers (i.e. section*,

bookmarks which are generated are badly placed and do not return to the 
place exact of the various levels of titles.

Is anybody have an idea to how solve this problem ?

Latexdiff can mark changes.  Maybe you could modify it to have the
changes become PDF comments.  Alternatively, maybe the maintainer
would be willing/able to do it.

Is there a way to insert raw html code into .tex source instead of
editing resulting html?

Thank you very much in advance

\HCode{raw html code}

Hi

You might want to use the \phantomsection command before you insert any labels. The command marks a position in the document where the pdf link can point to.

It should look something like the code snippet below
\subsection*{Testing}
\phantomsection
\label{subsecTesting}

Hello,

I want to write an environment that (among other things) typesets the

cannot use this since my environment accepts arguments (for the

It works perfectly well. But the command \phantomsection should precede 
  the level title (section*, subsection*, etc.) so that the pdf link can 
point to correctely and without using \labels for this kind of levels 
cause their have not counters.

Thanks a lot once again.

Before I purchase Adobe v9 professional
I want to know if anyone 
knows the name of pdfLaTeX hyperref parameters to add passwords for

Here is my hyperref options list:

I have reviewed hyperref.sty

I believe that the kewword parameters are defined here

line 2636:

\define at key{Hyp}{pdfkeywords}{\pdfstringdef\@pdfkeywords{#1}}

line 2740:

This message provides information about 

* Information Mapping

* a hack to implement 
  the InfoMapping Block Label
  in the refart and refrep class

** Information Mapping

* Common Knowledge
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_mapping

* visionary: Robert Horn, information presentation theorist
http://www.stanford.edu/~rhorn/ (obviously a Mac user, eh?!)

* Information Mapping, the company
"Making Information Work."
http://www.infomap.com/

* writing technical documentation is not like writing literature

* concept to replace 'paragraph': Block
  * Block Label in left column, bold, ragged right
  * Description in right column, 
    contains max of 9 (7 +-2) information items
    usually sentences, 
    but also lists (description, enumerate, itemize)
    and charts, figures, etc.


** The RefMan, RefArt and RefRep classes

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/refman/layout_e.pdf

* example:
\documentclass[10pt,smallborder]{refart}%*-margins=0.25 in, for screen
viewing only
%\documentclass[10pt]{refart}
\settextfraction{0.618}%default= .7 phi=0.6.18

* layout widths

| <-- fullwidth (full page width) ... --> |

is divided by the command settextfraction into left and right columns

| <-- leftmarginwidth --> | <-- textwidth ... --> |

* left margin commands

\marginpar{Text is set left (justified)}

\marginlabel{Text is set flush right}


** Problem Statement

* Sectioning commands are set in a box which width is fullwidth
and therefore are across both left and right columns,
i.e.: leftmarginwidth into textwidth.

* Q: How do I implement the Information Mapping Block Label?
or
* Q: How do I provide a box for a Block Label, 
     in the left column only,
     with text in bold face, 
     and ragged right? 


** Kludge

%%refart adjustments to left and right column widths
%%note: implements Info Map style of Block Label as boxed paragraph
%%note: leftmarginwidth is defined by refart
%%\settextfraction{0.618}%default= .7 phi=0.6.18
\newcommand{\marginparX}[1]%
           {\hspace{0pt}%strut
            \marginpar{\parbox[t]%
            {0.764\leftmarginwidth}%phi+phi*(1-phi))
            {\raggedright\textbf{#1}}}}

%%usage:
\marginparX{The Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over the Lazy Dog}%
Program development proceeds through these stages:

%%expected output: columnsep is three spaces for this demo

The Quick Brown Fox    Program development proceeds 
Jumped Over the Lazy   through these stages:
Dog

** Commentary

* Why do I need a strut 
  -- \hspace{0pt} -- 
  before the marginpar?

* Yes, I thought about modifying the sectioning commands,
I think that the paragraph or paragraph* 
would be the appropriate one to use.
However I couldn't easily see how to wedge the parbox 
into the section command syntax.

I would appreciate reading your commentary 
on this issue.

thanx in advance for your holiday musings

Ah, what I like about talking thru a problem with my peers!

solution: redefine paragraph without sectioning commands.

Beauty: allows document to conform to standard LaTeX definitions of
sectioning commands
and changes them only when I usepackage{refman-InfoMap}

Message-ID: <c458a2740811282027w5b1b1f48k5eef2e8ba2f81e9e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to tell latex to input files such that the
paths within those files are appended with a given path.

The situation is as follows:

My directory structure is

allproject
    project1
        fig
    project2
        fig

Each project* directory has a file writeup.tex which has
commands like \includegraphics{fig/example.ps}


Now I am trying to create a summary of all the projects
by having a file allproject/summary.tex as

\input{project1/writeup}
\input{project2/writeup}


But compilations fails as the compiler is not able to find
the figures in allproject/fig.

Is there a way to specify that all paths in the inputted
file should "projectx" appended to it?


Thanks.

Please include my email address on any replies; I am not subscribed to

Can I detect in a macro when I am at the top of a page to avoid adding 
boxes (vertical space and horizontal rule)?

I am using LaTeX to write my homework solutions.  For clarity, I add 
some vertical space and a horizontal rule to visually separate the 
problems.  But I do not need this visual separation if a new problem 
starts at the top of a page, so I would like to omit it to save space 
and minimize confusion.

Thank you!

If it were /just/ vertical white space, TeX would
do what you want automatically; however, you not
only want to lose VWSP at top of page but a
horizontal rule as well.  The key lies in what
exactly TeX is defined to jettison at top of page,
and the answer "discardable items" (pp.~110--112),
which include glue, kerns and penalty items.

Now there's no way you can convert a rule into
a kern or a penalty item, but you /can/ convert
it into a special sort of glue called "leaders".
So if you write (for example)

	\leaders \hrule \vskip 0,4pt

your rule will be concealed inside leaders, and
therefore become discardable.

Whether this will work out of the box with LaTeX,
I cannot say, but others more experienced with
LaTeX should be able to advise.

Subject: [texhax] Updating tlmgr

Hi Richard,

    > http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html
    During the update of bin-texlive, there was a "Does not look like a tar" 
    error message.  At the end of the process tlmgr disappeared from the bin 
    directories

Sorry to hear it.  I believe the underlying causes for that have been
fixed in the current tlmgr, FWIW.

    What is the best way to recover?

http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html#disaster

   I am testing this at home with a more complete installation than I need 
   to be able to advice computer support staff in the Rutgers Math 
   Department on installing TeX Live for a large number of users.

Hope it flies.  Let us know if problems persist.

Best,
Karl

Hi Phil, 
it seems that none of the commands mentioned above are redefined
by LaTeX.  Try:

  latex "\relax\nonstopmode\show\leaders\show\hrule\show\vskip\stop"

(Maybe without the quotes on Windows.)  Unless I misunderstand the
output, they all are primitives not replaced my macros.

\leaders is used by some LaTeX macros, there is an additional macro
\rule which takes an optional and two mandatory arguments.

The LaTeX macro \vspace{0.4pt} is discardable, \vspace*{0.4pt} is not.

There are very few plain TeX commands which had been replaced by LaTeX
macros and most of them are macros, not primitives.  They had been
made obsolete by LaTeX's tabbing environment, LaTeX's output routine,
NFSS, and LaTeX's eqnarray environment [1].  The latter is obsolete
too and document class designers better put
\RequirePackage[all]{onlyamsmath} into their class files.

The only primitive which had been changed that I'm aware of is \input.
However, the original behaviour is retained.  You can say \input{foo}
or \input foo .  (Note the space after foo :)

There are *very* few other plain TeX commands which don't work in
LaTeX (either not as expected or not at all) [1].

I assume that what you proposed works perfectly with LaTeX.  Using
LaTeX macros whenever possible is preferred though.

Thank you for your excellent suggestions. This seems to be working just 
as I want. Thanks again!

Thanks to Donald I found a way to input my file. However, I have another issue.

Each of my files have label with the same name, say \label{sec:intro}
and so on compilation I get  a warning

LaTeX Warning: Label `sec:intro' multiply defined

It is possible to include files such that the labels are redefined and
the references get resolved within their respective files.


Thanks
Sumit

What ?!  Knuth explicitly allows decimal commas /and/
decimal points, unlike CSS !  "0,4 pt" rules OK :-)
(Oh yes, and Knuth allows spaces before the unit while
  CSS does not : Knuth 2, CSS 0).

How could you forget \end?  That causes a help message to be
terribly wrong.  There are others such as \sqrt and \par.  

\box should have been redefined, but was not.
