List readers may be interested in this recent interview with
TeX's architect, Donald Knuth:

	http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856&rll=1

Don talks about TeX, Metafont, literate programming, and the writing
of his famous books, The Art of Computer Programming, and responds to
a number of questions about software development and tools, and the
trend towards multicore and multithreaded CPUs.

Dear all,

I've encountered something unexpected, that perhaps you all could shed  
a light on.  When writing

\def\Group#1{{#1}}
\newenvironment{mygroup}{\collectbody \Group}{}

\def\commandA#1(#2){#1(#2)-D}
\def\commandB#1#2#3{#1({#2(#3)})}
\def\commandC#1#2#3{#1(\bgroup#2(#3)\egroup)}
\def\commandD#1#2#3{#1(\begingroup#2(#3)\endgroup)}
\def\commandE#1#2#3{#1(\begin{mygroup}#2(#3)\end{mygroup})}

I get unexpected behaviour

\expandafter \commandA \commandB A B C	\\	% gives A(B(C))-D
\expandafter \commandA \commandC A B C \\	% gives A(B(C)-D)
\expandafter \commandA \commandD A B C \\	% gives A(B(C)-D)
\expandafter \commandA \commandE A B C \\	% gives A(B(C)-D)

I consider only the first result correct, and all the others wrong!   
In particular, I am looking to have the second version produce the  
first version's result, but I can't get it to work.

What is happening here?  Am I making a (perhaps rather stupid) mistake?

Let's look at the second line.  Imagine \commandC is already expanded
by \expandafter, so you get:

\commandA A(\bgroup B(C)\egroup)
            ^^^^^^^^^^^
            Becomes #2...

...because \bgroup and \egroup do not "wrap up" arguments, TeX does
not nest parentheses like it does braces, and it looks for the closest
argument delimiter, ")" in case of \commandA.  And because \bgroup is
not required to have a matching \egroup in the arguments (unlike
braces), it works without an error (as long as the matching \egroup
follows somewhere).

Does this make sense?  The other lines are similar.

HTH,
Oleg

Yes, in part; disappointing, however: how can you automatically  
generate recursive structures that you want to match against (in the  
functional programming style) if not by using \bgroup and \egroup?   
And they are both 'let' to { and } ... but I understand they are not  
the same.

Can you suggest a way around this?

> The other lines are similar.

What's puzzling me is that even the last alternative goes wrong.   
Following your argument, should TeX not complain about the missing  
"\end{mygroup}" when it closes on the first ")"?

Hi!
 
There is a symbol that I don't know how to write it in Tex/laTex .I saw lots os documents, websites, and none of them show this symbol.
 
It is a triangle made of 3 points, instead of lines. In a logic expression, it is used to give us the result. 
For exemplo if \exists ... therefore ...
 
How can I write this symbol?

Hello,
I think you're refering to the inverted pawnbrokers' sign which is 
read as "therefore" or "then" ( I think) in mathematics. The macro In 
the amsmath usepackage is "\therefore".
I hope it helps.
By the way, folks, I'm Paul, a blind student of software engineering 
from England. I'll probably be asking very similar questions about 
the visual effects of tex/latex macros meself. :-)

The article on Knuth was quite worthwhile reading, partially because of
the interesting links.  One of them was:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Displaying_a_formula

which gives

\therefore

and a lot of other nice symbols all on one page!

Message-ID: <200805021446.32994.john@wexfordpress.com>

I attempted to post to comp.text.tex via google but didn't succeed for 
some reason. I'll ask here instead.

A poster on another group likes to establish discrete page ranges for 
index terms even when they occur on two successive pages alone. He 
does this in case material is added later on between the two pages. I 
disagree with his logic but it is his book after all.  He uses Lyx, 
and hence Latex.

When he does this he wants the system to display the two pages as 
46,47 and not 46-47.  He found a makeindex style file parameter 
somewhere, "_2p" that causes this to happen. 

I don't find this in the manual. Can someone point me to documentation 
on the subject?

I'm not sure what you mean.  Why not use { and } ?  Can you provide an
example of what you want to achieve?

Yes, for argument delimiters, TeX searches for the tokens { and }
(with respective category codes, of course).

Maybe, if I can understand what you want :).

Not really.  "\end{mygroup}" is not even a primitive, so TeX does not
give it any special treatment -- as far as TeX cares, it's just some
control sequence.

You're very welcome.  Anytime someone points out a resource on this
news group that's interesting I put it on the page.  So a lot of
people have done the heavy lifting for me!  It's getting a little top
heavy and probably should be rearranged (or at least reviewed) for
easier use.  But I have to get back to publishing my molecular
information papers ... the next ones are the ones to watch for!!

Note that  the answer that others gave, to look in:

> http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/

is, as far as I know, the \emph{definitive} complete answer. 
Unfortunately it's a really big document and viewing it is slow and
awkward compared to the web.  That's not so good for a quick look up. 
I don't know if the wikipedia page covers everything.  But the big
advantage of the wikipedia page is it's html and one can find things
quickly on it.  So maybe someone could go through the comprehensive
list and see if it is expressed completely on the wiki page.  If not
they could add the missing symbols and then put a statement that it
contains the definitive list (as of whatever version).  That would be
a great service because html pages are so fast for looking up things. 
At minimum, a link to the definitive list on the wiki page would be
useful.

\therefore there is more to do!!  :-)

Hi, 

I began using Latex a few days ago. So far, I was doing pretty well until I came to the following problem.

Latex does not build the current input file to the end. 

I did place the command \newpage one line above the point where the build stops and then I get the complete input file build up. As I scroll back, there is almost half a page with nothing on it.

I did research on the Internet but did not find any help with this problem.

The Latex-Result line in the output screen are 2 Errors, 1 Warnings, 7 Bad Boxes and 6 pages. I tried to learn as much as I could about these and they do not appear to be the cause of the problem I am experiencing.

Your kind advice would be greatly appreciated.

Fix the errors you can first.  They could account for the issue.

If you can pare down your problem to the minimum file, you could post
that and people could then replicate it.  See:

    I don't find this in the manual. Can someone point me to documentation 
    on the subject?

I have no idea, but I wouldn't be surprised if there is none.  The
makeindex documentation has essentially never been updated (as far as I
know) since it was first written decades ago.  I suggest looking at the
sources.

If you or anyone would like to look at it with an eye towards a
general overhaul and update for today's world, comparing it with the
current sources, etc., that would be great.

Thanks,

On Ubuntu, the tex documentation is in a different package, probably
tetex-doc is what you want.

Perhaps he's confusing this with the parameter "suffix_2p", but this
replaces the end number as well as the range character, so for example, 

suffix_2p "f."

will produce 46f. (as far as I can tell from the man page). You could
perhaps define a makeindex style file that puts the entire page list for a
given entry in an argument that could then be parsed by TeX. For example:

delim_0 "\\pagerange{"
delim_1 "\\pagerange{"
delim_2 "\\pagerange{"
delim_t "}"

and then define \pagerange{<list>} to parse the list, substituting the
relevant character (but this might get complicated if the page ranges have
formatting commands).

CFP: Towards Digital Mathematics Library (DML 2008)
July 27th, 2008, Birmingham, UK c/o MKM 2008

Workshop webpage:
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/dml-2008.xhtml

Deadlines: May 31st: abstract submissions 
           Jun  1st: paper submissions 
           Jun 20th: paper acceptance/rejection decision
           Jun 27th: versions for the proceedings due
           Jul 27th: workshop date, proceedings on site

Submissions:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=dml2008
Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, 
potential impact for building DML, and clarity. Papers must conform to the 
Springer LNCS style, preferably using LaTeX2e and the Springer llncs class files.

Submission categories:
Full paper: 4-12 LNCS pages
Short paper/poster/work in progress report: 1-4 LNCS pages 

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects, 
asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow [CEDRAM model])?

Proceedings:
will be published by Masaryk University and will be available on site,
with best papers chosen for postconference proceedings published
by renowned publisher or for journal.

Keynote:

Subject: [texhax] pdfTeX warning.
Message-ID: <20080505220715.GA4807@math.ku.edu>

Hello

In a file that I am trying to compile with pdflatex, I have the following
line

[...]
characteristic of the field. See~\cite{eiscommalg} for the definition of
[...]

I am calling hyperref with 

\RequirePackage[pdftex,pagebackref=true,breaklinks=true,colorlinks=false,plainpages=true,pdfborder=0 0 0]{hyperref}
\AtBeginDocument{\hypersetup{pdftitle={\@title},pdfauthor={\@author}}}

Now, the \cite command works correctly, but I get the following warning 

! pdfTeX warning (dest): name{cite.eiscommalg} has been referenced but does not
 exist, replaced by a fixed one
 
In the pdf file, the label for this citation appears as a clickable
internal link, but when I click on it, it goes to the first page, and not to
the bibliography. This problem does not occur for \ref, though; I can get
to the correct \label, by clicking on those links.

I saw multiple references to this problem in the context of footnotes on
various mailing lists, but none in the context of bibliography. How can I
fix this?

Thank you.
Manoj.

I am struggling in bibtex, if anyone of u know how to delete a dot at the end of the bibliography for a particular references.

e.g.

The dot is programmed into the .bst file.  So in theory you can
reprogram it not to be there.  The bst language is somewhat weird but
it is possible.  Of course you have to give up the bst you were using.

Having a period at the end of a URL is not good, but if you use

\usepackage{html}

you can have the links be active in your pdf(!) and it wouldn't matter
for the user, in that case anyway.

See:
http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html#makebst
for more information and links.  makebst lets you make your own bst.
Tame the BeaST is about programming.

Subject: [texhax] color with titletoc
Message-ID: <541641.45865.qm@web27006.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I would like to use colors in my TOC. Until now, I use
the package titletoc to format my TOC, but I can't
manage to put color for entries...
Here is the kind of code I use:
\titlecontents{chapter}[20pt]%
{\addvspace{1pc}\normalfont\sffamily\bfseries\large\color{chapterColor}}%
{\color{chapterColor}}{\color{chapterColor}}%
{\hfill\contentspage}[]

The only effect of (the first instance of)
"\color{chapterColor}" is to color the number of the
page. No success to color the entry itself.
Any suggestion?
Thanks
Thierry

Message-ID: <4821D4E3.6070605@uit.co.uk>

- Using book.cls

\def\@schapter#1{

\def\@schapter#1{
     \@makeschapterhead{#1}%
     \@afterheading
     \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{#1}}

we get error:

   \originalTeX ->\noextrasenglish

However, if we change the added line to:

then it "works", i.e. runs without error, but it's useless
of course.  The same pattern happens when we try to insert
	\mkboth{#1}{#1}

I assume I'm doing something stupid, but I'm so confused

i'm not really conversant with how book.cls
does its toc insertions, but the amsbook.cls
does put the starred chapters into the t-of-c.
you might be able to crib some code from that.

    I assume I'm doing something stupid, but I'm so confused
    after trying this for hours that I can't think how to
    start tracking it down.  Help!

i've also seen your other message about adding
"Appendices" in the t-of-c.  i think your best
bet there is to use something like this:

  \addcontentsline{toc}{part}{Appendices}

alternatively, you could try entering all the
gory details:

  \addtocontents{toc}{\protect\contentsline{part}%
    {\protect\tocpart{}{}{Appendices}}{}

with amsbook, this would give just the heading,
with no page number; i'm not sure how book.cls
will react to this.

good luck.

I personally do not like such redefinitions. I think it would be better to
define a new command for the new job -- after all, are you sure you will
never need the original starred version? And will you still be able to read
your own code in some years? Especially the second part will be much easier
if you use a new name for the new command.

So what I would do is something like this (untested!):

\usepackage{ifthen}
\newcommand{\chapterNoNumber}[2][]{%
	\chapter*{#2}%
	% allow for the optional argument of chapter*:
	\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{}}%
		{\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{#2}\markboth{#2}{#2}}%
		{\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{#1}\markboth{#1}{#1}}%
}

Hope that helps,

These are the keywords. What you seem to be looking for is
\frontmatter, \mainmatter and \backmatter. Then no starred versions of
\chapter are needed.

Subject: [texhax] \addcontentsline -- line added to TOC appears in wrong
 place -- ANSWER
Message-ID: <4822B54E.6040602@uit.co.uk>

The answer is:
(a) The description below isn't accurate -- the \chapter*'s
     are in fact \include'd in the main file.
(b) The LaTeX Companion explicitly describes the problem of
     \addtocontents when used at the same level as \include,
     on p49 (Second Ed.).  It says, in effect, "don't do it".
(c) \input instead of \include does seem to work OK, and lets
     us keep the same file organization.

Subject: [texhax] variable number of columns in a longtable
Message-ID: <20080508113206.GB13084@eureca.de>

Hi,

I would like to use the same document for two output formats, both
generated with LaTeX. One of the differences is the number of columns in
one longtable.

What I have right now (stripped down of course):

--------------------
\documentclass{scrartcl}
\usepackage{longtable}
\begin{document}

\makeatletter
\newif\if at SHORT
% only the short column (does not work):
%\@SHORTtrue
% two columns instead (seems to work):
\@SHORTfalse

\if at SHORT\longtable{|l|l|}\else\longtable{|l|l|l|}\fi
\hline
\endhead
\endfoot
main column
& \if at SHORT
    only one additional column
  \else
      first  additional column
    & second additional column
  \fi
\\\hline
\endlongtable
\end{document}
---------------

I think I understand why it does not work (it seems OK if you generate the
long version, but its flaw shows itself for the short version).

Any ideas how I could make this work?

Thanks a lot for your help,

	Susan

Message-ID: <20080508114119.GC13084@eureca.de>

Hi,

for a LaTeX document I would like to define a macro \CREATE, which
- takes some arguments itself
- creates and accesses a counter with a name of the first argument
  concatenated with some identifying letters (I need more than one such
  counter)
- creates a macro with a name equal to the first argument, where other
  arguments of the \CREATE macro define specifics of this macro, and which
  itself takes some arguments

Such a macro would greatly reduce duplicated code in a document I'm writing
currently, but unfortunately it's far beyond my skills :-(

Any pointers as to how to solve this problem would be very welcome,

Your guess is probably right.

This is all I could come up with in the ten minutes I had spare, but it
seems to work.  By the way, I wouldn't use @ and \makeatletter all the way
through your code; it's really not likely to be necessary if you use capital
letters.

\documentclass{scrartcl}
\usepackage{longtable}
\begin{document}

\newif\ifSHORT
\SHORTtrue % only the short column
%\SHORTfalse % two columns instead

\def\SecondCol#1#2{\ifSHORT#1\else#2\fi}
\def\ThirdCol#1{\ifSHORT\else#1\fi}
\ifSHORT
  \longtable{|l|l@{}l|}
\else
  \longtable{|l|l|l|}
\fi
\hline
\endhead
\endfoot
main column
&\SecondCol{only one additional column}{first  additional column}
&\ThirdCol{second additional column}
\\\hline
\endlongtable
\end{document}

I am a member of TUG, and since I switched computers MiKTeX often can't find common .sty files, such as verbatim.sty, listings.sty, fullpage.sty, etc.
 
I decided to uninstall MiKTeX and reinstall it from my TeX Collection cd, but it is unreadable.  In fact, the shiny side is even partly discolored .
 
How can I uninstall and download a complete fresh MiKTex?
 
Also, could you mail me a good cd?

Hi,

I download and burned the DVD ISO and installed it on my computer
(windows xp). I changed the default root from C:\TexLive2007 to D:
\TexLive2007. I then proceeded to selet my packages and installed the
whole thing. When I try to compile a sample tex file using pdflatex, I
get this error:

I seems its looking at the wrong place for texmf.cnf. I do not know
how to make to it look at the correct place.

Any help on this is greatly appreciated.

No, you should use \frontmatter and \backmatter instead.
If you do what you intend then there is no option for fragile
commands in titles to \chapter*.

classic fragile command in a moving argument.  I don't what the argument
was, but the moving is done by \addcontentsline or \markboth.

>    \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{foobar}

foobar contains no fragile commands.

Dear TeX users,

Conferences:

- TUG 2008 (http://tug.org/tug2008) will return to Cork, Ireland, again
  hosted by Peter Flynn, July 21-24, 2008.  We've extended the deadline
  for submission of abstracts to May 31, 2008; a few slots are still
  available.  The accepted submissions are listed at
  http://www.ucc.ie/en/tug2008/prog.  Please join us!

- Other upcoming meetings include:
  The second ConTeXt user meeting, in Bohinj, Slovenia,
    August 20-25, 2008: http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2008.

  And a look towards next year:
  - TUG 2009 will be held at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend,
    Indiana, USA, from July 27-31, 2009.
  - EuroTeX 2009 will be held in The Hague, The Netherlands, from
    August 31 through September 4, 2009.


Journals:

- Issue 2008-1 of the PracTeX Journal has been published; it is
  available at http://tug.org/pracjourn.  The theme of this issue is
  LaTeXniques.

- The second (regular) issue of TUGboat for 2008 is nearly complete and
  should make its way to the printer within a couple more weeks.


Software:

- We are happy to pass on the news that UK-TUG (http://uk.tug.org) has
  given generous support to the TeX Gyre (fonts) and TeXWorks (front
  end) projects, which TUG has also been sponsoring.  (TUG's overall
  development roadmap document is available via
  http://tug.org/tc/devfund/grants.html.)  Thanks to UK-TUG!

- TUG was selected as one of the organizations to participate in
  Google's Summer of Code 2008, and three projects were funded:
  Christoph Hafmeister with MathTran, Arthur Reutenauer with improving
  Unicode support in TeX extensions, and Mojca Miklavec on enhancing the
  TeXShow documentation system.  http://tug.org/gsoc/ has more info.

- Finally, work on TeX Live 2008 continues apace; the developers 
  still hope that it will be released in time for the TUG'08 conference.


Happy TeXing,

This is the only question I can answer (I'm just a plain TUG member).  
I'm not a MikTeX user, but I have it installed in a virtual machine.

Go to the Start menu and open Set Program Access and Defaults. In the  
window that opens choose Change or Remove Programs; scroll down to  
MikTeX and choose Remove. The MikTeX site

http://www.miktex.org/2.7/Setup.aspx

In the same page above there are links to download either the basic

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0805090845450.2992@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

I am not entirely certain what you are trying to do, but I would like to 
offer the following code from my diagram making macros:

\def\node#1(#2,#3)[#4]{%
\expandafter\gdef\csname x@#1\endcsname{#2}%
\expandafter\gdef\csname y@#1\endcsname{#3}%
\expandafter\gdef\csname ob@#1\endcsname{#4}%
\ignorespaces}%

What this code does is to take something like
\node a(30,40)[A]
and define three macros whose definitions are equivalent to
\gdef\x at a{30}
\gdef\y at a{40}
\gdef\ob at a{A}

There are several things to note.  First, \newcommand will not work.  Of 
course, if I used it as
\node {a}{30}{40}{A}
it would, but I don't much like all those braces (and most parts of the 
diagram macros cannot be coded using \newcommand either.  I use \gdef 
because this appears inside another macro; I don't think there is a 
\newcommand equivalent.  Finally, the node names don't have to be letters 
only.  I could (and regularly do) use things like
\node 3c(30,40)[A]
since the form
\expandafter \csname ??? \endcsname {definition}
allows any string of characters as a control sequence name.  Of course, 
when calling these macros, the same thing has to be done.  These macros 
are used in the following form:
\morphism(\csname x@#3\endcsname,\csname y@#3\endcsname)|#1|/{#2}/%
<\xfinish,\yfinish>[\csname ob@#3\endcsname`\csname ob@#4\endcsname;#5]%
}%
An earlier implementation of this used two counters for each node.  This 
one uses just two counters, since the numerical values are stored as 
macros, not counters and just  two temporary counters are used for a whole 
diagram.  This is important since tex puts a severe restriction on the 
number of counters (256, of which several dozen are used by latex alone) 
while the number of macros is effectively unlimited (my tex implementation 
reports that there are 10000 + 50000, which I don't understand, but 5000 
is what I typically use).

I hope this helps.

Look at The TeXbook: 
AFAIK the `&'s in a TeX array are the tokens that TeX looks at first for in an \halign. 
Therefore you can't hide them by any \if. 

I dare to become bold and unhumble, but thus I might convince you 
that my solution is well-tested, namely with more than three dozens of tables in a 
critical editions I'm working for (volume for German Copernicus Complete Edition). 

My simple solution to hide `&' is fooling TeX by making `&' active and expanding to  
to TeX's original `&'. The following snippet from my 

    http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/lineno/edtable.sty

may make clear how to exactly (I also omit confusing lines): 

% Change ampersand at \Anote etc.: (wizard interface) 
%% 2003/10/31. 
% & is changed by \Anote etc. \begingroup 
% ---Global change seems to break table setup. 
\begingroup 
\gdef\@ET at hideamps{\catcode`\&\active}
\@ET at hideamps 
\gdef\@ET at ampnotes{% 
  \let&\@ET at hideamp 
  \let\@ET at EN@rnote\@EN at note 
  \def\@EN at note{\@ET at hideamps\@ET at EN@rnote}%
  \let\@ET at EN@rnotelb\@EN at notelabel 
  \def\@EN at notelabel{\@ET at hideamps\@ET at EN@rnotelb}%

Axel has answered this sufficiently, but have you looked for `MiKTeX' 
in "all programs" from the start menu? You should find it if MiKTeX has been installed 
as it should be IMHO. And in installing, you might think of this HO of mine.

This is from suggestions for the TeX Catalogue that I have made recent months: 

- makecmds, suffix weiter dazu passend:
(a) twoopt, xargs, xoptarg
(Zahl m?glicher optionaler Parameter)
(b) cmdstring, etoolbox, etexcmds, mathcmd,
patch, patchcmd, pdftexcmds, robustcommand, xnewcommand

I leave it to you to find whether something in the list solves your problem, 
but it may be interesting to compare the packages. Most or all of them 
are just in 

    [tex-archive]/macros/latex/contrib/

Or better: I have discovered things like 

    http://ctan.tug.org/pkg/makecmds

just recent days (maybe recent great work of the CTAN Team). 
You can replace the `makecmds' there with other package names. 
What I find great about this is that you needn't bookmark it, 
because it is easy to memorize and to type. 

I might easily make exactly what you want, but I urgently must tame my 
addiction to volunteering ...

It looks like you are making most of the table optional, so it
would be simpler to have one test selecting between two complete
lontable environments.  

How long are they?  Enough to overflow TeX's memory?

Subject: [texhax] nested macro and counter generation [better]
Message-ID: <878301572@web.de>

... my former list may not have helped you, sorry. But isn't it simply

    \newcommand{\CREATE}[1]{%
      \newcounter{#1}\expandafter \newcommand \csname #1\endcsname}

? Then use \CREATE like \newcommand with the only difference that you omit 
the backslash starting the desired command name, or like \newenvironment 
omitting the final argument. 

But it is not entirely clear to me what you mean about the counters. 
Do you mean you may need more than one counter per one new command? Then perhaps

  \makeatletter
    \newcommand{\CREATE}[2][\empty\empty]{% effect: \def\@fortmp{\empty}%
      \@for\CREATEid:=#1\do{\newcounter{#2\CREATEid}}%
      \expandafter \newcommand \csname #2\endcsname}
  \makeatother

(tested). The \@for is a LaTeX internal. 
The mandatory argument would be the command name (without backslash), 
again use \CREATE similarly to \newcommand as above. If you want more 
than one counter, use the optional argument for a comma-separated list. 
E.g., \CREATE[a,b,c]{foo}[1]{\typeout{#1!!}} will obtain counter names 
fooa, foob, fooc. 

The last \CREATEid could be preceded with a, e.g., `-', to obtain counter names, 
e.g., foo-a, foo-b, foo-c: 

  \makeatletter
    \newcommand{\CREATE}[2][\empty\empty]{%
      \@for\CREATEid:=#1\do{% 
        \newcounter{#2\expandafter \ifx\CREATEid\empty \else -\CREATEid \fi}}%
      \expandafter \newcommand \csname #2\endcsname}
  \makeatother

but \thefoo-a would break. Then you might define something like 

    \newcommand{\The}[1]{\csname the#1\endcsname}

to type \The{foo-a} instead of \thefoo-a. (Tested without-option and with [a,b,c]. ) 

And it is not clear wether you want that the counters are reset by others. 

HTH -- Uwe.

Sorry, I keep my diagnosis from before, but I hardly hinted at a ready solution -- 
I am presenting one here. 

Diagnosis was: "Look at The TeXbook: AFAIK the `&'s in a TeX array are the tokens that 
TeX looks at first for in an \halign. Therefore you can't hide them by any \if. " 

Very simple solution (after hours of trying along my former way): 

    \newcommand{\HiddenAmp}{&}
    \newcommand{\longcolumn}[1]{\if at SHORT\else \HiddenAmp #1\fi}

This ensures that TeX's \halign discovers the cell delimiter only after the \if 
has been expanded.

You haven't specified which column is the extra one, below you can choose via `%' 
whether it is the second or the third one (tested). 

--------------------
\documentclass{scrartcl}
\usepackage{longtable}
\begin{document}

\makeatletter
\newif\if at SHORT
%\@SHORTtrue
\@SHORTfalse

\newcommand{\HiddenAmp}{&}
\newcommand{\longcolumn}[1]{\if at SHORT\else \HiddenAmp #1\fi}

\if at SHORT\longtable{|l|l|}\else\longtable{|l|l|l|}\fi
\hline
\endhead
\endfoot
first certain column
\longcolumn{additional column}
& 
second certain column
% \longcolumn{additional column}
\\\hline
\endlongtable

Except I didn't type it from memory.  I used search to go to the
page and then pasted the URL from the location bar!  Except I must 
have gone back or something before pasting!  My URL is for the
search "keyword=", and so yours is also for a search.  What you

Right, I was on

   http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=conditional

(for other readers) and then probably copied your URL inside the message and changed ... 
dear readers, "label=conditional" is an instance of "keyword=optional".

I really don't know, but would it be possible for you to download  
MacTeX?:

http://www.tug.org/mactex/

It's a huge download, I know, but worth every byte. MacTeX is the Mac  
distribution of TeXLive, which is the standard TeX distro. It comes  
with TeXShop, a very friendly (La)TeX editor that calls pdfTeX by  
default. There are other front-ends (editors), like TeXmaker

http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/

that also work out of the box with MacTeX.

There is a mailing list for TeX on Mac OS X:

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex


Best,

Axel

Message-ID: <9e0d35cb0805112221h3f8d6bc9m949f389081611bd1@mail.gmail.com>

I've been having trouble trying to figure out how to get LaTeX to give
me an inter-sentence space where I want it. I've spent some time with
TeX FAQs and Google, and I've briefly searched the texhax archives,
too. The closest I can find is the standard advice about how to
restore an inter-sentence space when a sentence ends with a capital
letter (i.e., use \@.). This isn't my problem, though.

My problem is when a sentence ends inside a nested quotation, as, for
example, in The Brothers Karamazov:

`But when you come ... ``Publish it through all the town," she would
say, ``I'm not afraid of you."' I looked at the young lady, ...

Notice that there are two end-quotation marks between "of you." and "I
looked": first a ", and then a '. While LaTeX seems to use
inter-sentence space correctly when a sentence ends inside a single
quotation, it doesn't seem to give me an inter-sentence space here,
where two quotations have ended.

I'm not sure I understand, but both the TeXbook and the LaTeX guide
show examples:

``\,`Fi' or `fum'\,'' he asked.

And, by the way, don't use ", use ''.

it's a question of the \sfcode, see TeXbook p. 76. You can play with it
like:

\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
\begin{document}

french:
\sfcode`\'3000 \sfcode`\"3000

town." I \par town."' I

nonfrench:
\sfcode`\'1000 \sfcode`\"1000

town." I\par town."' I

transparent:
\sfcode`\'0 \sfcode`\"0 % cf. TeXbook p. 76

town." I\par town."' I
\end{document}

i guess what you want is to make both " and ' transparent to the space
factor of the point, which they are not by default (not even the " as
you see in the example). These default settings you find in latex.ltx.

That's not a "by the way", that is the answer!

" is not correct input for end-quotes, and it hides the
punctuation from the end of sentence.

Thanks! I normally type '', but in this case there were "s in the text
I was working from, and I thought they were equivalent, so I didn't
bother changing them all. This solution even works with the \thinspace
I'm using to help distinguish adjacent quote-marks.

I'm still mildly curious about how to input a space of equivalent size
and stretchiness to an inter-sentence space. Perhaps Hartmut's answer
is the key, but I think I need the TeXbook to understand it. I wonder
how much it costs to ship it to New Zealand ...

That's one answer, but you'll have to read the TeXbook to figure it out:-)

    \spacefactor\sfcode`.{ }

That seems best, but somehow I feel compelled to mention
\fontdimen7\font, where is where the "extra space" after-sentence amount
originates.  (Appendix F.)

Message-ID: <2109.200.133.3.100.1210702010.squirrel@www.webmail.univasf.edu.br>

Hello,

I understand that the \leftmark command contains the text for the
headings of a page (in this case, the chapter name), and is updated
every time the \chapter command is issued. However, the \chapter* does
not update \leftmark accordingly and I have to do this by hand, as
below:

\leftmark {some-text}

This works well, except for the fact that all uses of the \chapter
command after the line above will not update the headings to the name
of the current chapters, which remains, in all chapters, "some-text".


My question is: how can I restore \leftmark to its original definition
before the \leftmark was issued? Or, if easier, how do I make the
\chapter* command update the headings of the page correctly (i.e, the
contents of \leftmark command)?

Thanks in advance,

Thanks for all this information, everyone. Your knowledge of TeX is

If you're using Mac or Linux, in your terminal do the following  
commands:

sudo updmap-sys --setoption dvipsDownloadBase35 true
sudo updmap-sys --setoption pdftexDownloadBase14 true
sudo updmap-sys --setoption dvipdfmDownloadBase14 true


Maybe is the same for TeXLive on Windows (I don't know for MikTeX).

Best,

Axel

As Tom Sgouros has answered, this is really hard.
The header/footer thing is probably easy, just as Tom Sgouros
suggested. A paragraph identifier as the first string in the first
line of the page is really very very, needing knowledge that
(AFAIK) is difficult to access.

I guess that Donald Arseneau's

     http://ctan.tug.org/pkg/fwlw

("first word/ last word") can be used with an additional trick.
(Attach a string to that first word, with a negative \hspace.)

-- Uwe.

P.S.: lineno.sty perhaps gives some ideas, together with
The TeXbook and the LaTeX source about output routines.
A not released version of lineno.sty is near putting that
identifier into the margin.

    How can i embedded all fonts using pdflatex?

That is the default.

When fonts end up unembedded from including figure pdf's (or whatever),
I use Ghostscript to do it:
ps2pdf -dEmbedAllFonts=true -dPDFX=true in.pdf out.pdf

(Despite the name, it will read .pdf too.)

There are other suggestions for gs in this area:
 -dPDFSETTINGS=/printer 
 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress
 -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 

Good luck,
karl

Subject: [texhax] How to dereference a \ref in a command definition?
Message-ID: <20080516171637.GA2367@lapse.madduck.net>

Hello,

I am trying to write a command to manipulate some section
references. My problem is that when I pass it something like

  \ref{mysection}

in #1, then \meaning{#2} tells me it's

  \protect\ref{mysection}

If I define a variable with that value (I am probably not using the
right terms here...),

  \def\myref{#2}

then I can get rid of the \protect and \meaning\myref gives:

  \ref{mysection}

What I would really want/need at this stage is the section ref
"unpacked", so replaced with its number, e.g. 4.1.2.

How can I achieve this?

Thank you!

You probably need an \edef.  It's not entirely
clear what you're up to, but the following
fragment may illustrate the use of \edef for
dererencing \ref s.

move about 15 mm up on the page. Anyone who knows what to do?

Hey, thanks for taking the time to respond!

Okay, this helps, and I got it working in a test case, which
I attached. The idea is that moving around a lot of text and having
subsubsections unnumbered invariably causes stuff like

  1.2.3 A section

  Bla bla as I will show in \ref{sub} bla bla
  [...]

  Subsection title \label{sub}

  Bla bla

Which then turns into the silly

  1.2.3 A section

  Bla bla as I will show in 1.2.3 bla bla

Thus, I was thinking to compare the expanded ref with \the* and use
pagerefs instead, leaving the rest of the magic up to varioref. I'd
love to be shown a better solution, because once I get this working,
I'll need to deal with the fact that then stuff like

  "in 1.2.3"

will suddenly become

  "in page 4"

which is also stupid.

I've also brought up this issue before on texhax, but it's been so
long that I decided to start from scratch and somehow ended up doing
so on tug! :)

>> \edef \theref {\ref {b}}

So unfortunately, in my complex thesis document, when I use the
attached refs.sty, which now uses \edef to expand the rvalue,
latex (texlive) dies on the first occurrence of any of the \?ref{}
commands:

! Use of \\aref doesn't match its definition.
\@ifnextchar ... \reserved at d =#1\def \reserved at a {
                                                  #2}\def \reserved at b {#3}\f...
l.52 ... documents, the \ac{DFSG} (see \aref{dfsg}
                                                  ), a part of \D{}'s

If I change back to using \def instead of \edef on line 6 of
refs.sty, then stuff goes back to normal.

This leaves me completely clueless.

Thanks for your time and help!

Ah, nice. Except in my thesis, I still get

! Use of \\aref doesn't match its definition.
\@ifnextchar ... \reserved at d =#1\def \reserved at a {
                                                  #2}\def \reserved at b {#3}\f...

No idea what this is about... and no idea how to recreate that in
the test case...

But now \meaning\curref says:

  macro:\getrefnumber ->\protect \ref{mysection}

and obviously there is no match with the output of e.g.
\thesubsection...

Gosh, this is rocket science to me...

Did you also change the macros calling \rrefx as I showed you?

This is hyperref. If you \usepackage{hyperref} in refs.sty, you'll
see it.

I realise hyperref probably messes *a lot* with \ref, but I wonder
if there is still a way to get what I want?

 From your email address I guess that you are in Sweeden and are using 
A4  paper. Acrobat distiller defaults to letter paper which is shorter 
and wider than A4 and this causes the effect that you observed. You can 
change the paper size in the "Settings|Edit Adobe PDF settings..." menu 
item and save a new default.

Hope this helps,

Second Call for papers: Towards Digital Mathematics Library (DML 2008)
July 27th, 2008, Birmingham, UK c/o MKM 2008

Workshop webpage:
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/dml-2008.xhtml

Deadlines: May 31st: abstract submissions 
           Jun  1st: paper submissions 
           Jun 20th: paper acceptance/rejection decision
           Jun 27th: versions for the proceedings due
           Jul 27th: workshop date, proceedings on site

Submissions:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=dml2008
Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, 
potential impact for building DML, and clarity. Papers must conform to the 
Springer LNCS style, preferably using LaTeX2e and the Springer llncs class files.

Submission categories:
Full paper: 4-12 LNCS pages
Short paper/poster/work in progress report: 1-4 LNCS pages 

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects, 
asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow [CEDRAM model])?

Proceedings:
will be published by Masaryk University and will be available on site,
with best papers chosen for postconference proceedings published
by renowned publisher or for journal.

Keynote: 
Thierry Bouche (Universite de Grenoble I, CNRS, Institut Fourier 
& Cellule Mathdoc): CEDRICS: when CEDRAM meets Tralics

Topics: 
(include, but are not limited to)
  o search, indexing and retrieval of mathematical documents
  o ranking of mathematical papers, similarity of mathematical documents
  o math OCR with MathML/TeX output
  o document conversions from/to MathML, OpenMath, LaTeX,

  o conversions between various mathematical formalisms
  o mathematical document compression
  o processing of scanned images
  o algorithms for crosslinking of bibliographical items, 
    intext citations search
  o mathematical document classification, MSC 2010
  o mathematical text mining
  o mathematical documents metadata exchange via OAI-PMH and/or OAI-ORE
  o long term archiving, data migration
  o reports and experience from math digitization projects
  o math publishing with long term archival goal

Isn't pdfLaTeX embedding the font as NimbusSanL? That's the URW name  
for Helvetica.

Hi All, I hope this list is not strict about off topic questions.
Not sure where else to get better info. Please disregard or
respond off list with complaints I'll forward summary to the list
if that is warrented.

I've come across PDF files that I can read fine on screen but
which contain fonts that don't print, for example

http://www.ciaonet.org/journals/gjia/v9i1/0000699.pdf

I can read "Science&Technology" across the top, even copy that
text on screen. But, it's not on the printout, neither the
paragraph headings.  I'm using mac (leopard/preview) to view/print
the doc. In the past I've tried a variety of pdf transforming; the
only way I was able to make it work was making a tiff file which I
cold print, with obvious limitations/problems.

Why does this happen/how can I avoid it in my docs?  Is there a
way to fix it for a complete printout?

Can't replicate the problem using Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.1.2
under Windows/XP.  No idea what "Leopard/preview" is/does;
have you tried Adobe Acrobat Reader on your Macintosh ?

Hi George,
though you created the document with Quark I think it's ok to ask
here.

It seems that the document is ok.  Subsets of all the fonts are
embedded.  The font used in the headline is:

/Notice (Copyright (c) 1992 Adobe Systems Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.Grotesque is a trademark of The Monotype Corporation plc registered in the U.S. Patent & TM Office.) readonly def
/FullName (Grotesque MT Condensed) readonly def

I disassembled the embedded subset of this font and at a first glance
I can't detect anything unusual.

However, when I extract the font from the PDF file and create a
PostScript file using this subset then I get an empty page when I try
to display the file with gv/ghostscript.  In order to double-check I
included another font (Pagella).  This one works.

This is the PS file I created:
-------------------------------------------------------
%!PS
%!PS-AdobeFont-1.0: TeXGyrePagella-Regular 1.103
%%% [a lot of stuff omitted]

%!FontType1-1.0: GrotesqueMT-Condensed001.000
%%% [a lot of stuff omitted]

100 100 moveto
/GrotesqueMT-Condensed findfont 20 scalefont setfont
(Science&Technology) show

100 300 moveto
/TeXGyrePagella-Regular findfont 20 scalefont setfont
(Science&Technology) show

showpage
-------------------------------------------------------

I only see TeXGyrePagella-Regular but not GrotesqueMT-Condensed.
Though I don't see any irregularities in the disassambled font I
think that there *must* be something unusual with this font.

I have no problems to display your document with acroread and xpdf,
but when I use gv(ghostscript) the page is built up and everything is
visible, even the headlines, but immediately after the page had been
built up everything is wiped out.

George, I don't want to mislead you to violate copyrights.  But maybe
it's ok for debugging:  Microsoft provides a lot of Monotype fonts and
maybe there is also GrotesqueMT-Condensed.  If yes, could you try it?
They provide TrueType fonts while what you are currently using are
Type1 fonts.  Maybe they behave differently.

Do you have a TeX system installed?  It would be helpful.  Do the
programs pdftops, t1ascii, t1disasm, and Perl exist on your system?

If not, see 

  http://ii2.sourceforge.net/tex-index.html

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,

I recently ran into the following problem:


! LaTeX Error: Too many math alphabets used in version normal.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.


How i solve this problem.

I hope you get a better answer than the ones here:

but I really doubt it. I think you'll end up getting back your text  
and doing a LaTeX mark up on it again.

Is there any way that the LaTeX source -- by altering pdflatex -- can
be carried through to the PDF and embedded in some special PDF comment
syntax?

Only as an option of course: not by default.

Then the PDF could be processed to extract-out the original LaTeX.

I would suggest that comments in the original LaTeX not be included,
and that /includes be expanded in-line.

Hi Peter,

I'm sorry to tell you but this is not possible. In the PDF you will not find a 
single line of LaTeX command in the same manner as you would not find a 
single line source code in a .exe file.
Reverse Engineering it the only thing you can do.
You might like to try to save the PDF-file as RTF and try to convert this back 
to LaTeX. But I guess a lot of format styles will be lost and you have to 
make your hands dirty to correct all this. The problem is that all this 
parsers try to set 1:1 the layout by using as much LaTeX code as possible. 
You will find unreadable amounts of LaTeX command for just a single detail of 
the preferred layout.

>From my experience in is a lot of easier to just transfer the plain text and 
to do all this format stuff again. This is much more quicker as you might 
aspect and you will not have to fiddle around with plenty conversion 
parameters.

Thus my way would be
 PDF -> pure TXT -> coffee -> hand made layouting -> coffee -> LaTeX -> Smile

Subject: [texhax] Controlling line spacing in footnotes with plain TeX
Message-ID: <483C9CFF.8020405@gmail.com>

I have the following definition of \footnote:

----

\def\footnote#1{\let\atsf=\empty %
  \ifhmode\edef\atsf{\spacefactor=\the\spacefactor}\/\fi
  \raise 0ex \hbox{#1}\atsf\vfootnote{#1}}

----

and the following definition of \vfootnote:

----

\def\vfootnote#1{\insert\footins\bgroup
  \interlinepenalty=\interfootnotelinepenalty
  \splittopskip=\ht\strutbox
  \splitmaxdepth=\dp\strutbox \floatingpenalty=20000
  \leftskip=0pt \rightskip=0pt \spaceskip=0pt \xspaceskip=0pt
  \baselineskip=XXX (see below)
  \rmfnote
  \textindent{#1}\footstrut\futurelet\next\foatt}

----

Outside of the footnote, \baselineskip is set to 13.5pt ? 0.5pt. But I want
it to be smaller in the footnote. But I don't understand what is happening
as I try various values for XXX in the above code.

I am trying to typeset a three-line footnote.

1. If I omit the line containing XXX, the footnote is typeset with the same
line spacing as the main text, which is what I would expect.

2. However, if I set it to (say) 10pt, the distance between the first pair
of lines in the footnote is visibly less than the distance between the
second pair.

After reviewing page 78 of the TeXbook, I tried the following in place of
the line containing XXX above:

----

  \baselineskip=10pt
  \lineskip=10pt

----

But that just made things worse (for reasons I don't understand at all).
Now  the distance between lines 1 and 2 of the footnote looks reasonable,
but the distance between lines 2 and 3 is huge.

Can someone explain what I need to do to set the lines of the footnote so
that have a consistent separation?

Yes please, if you can provide a small file that shows the problem, I
am sure, it is easy to debug and help you.  Yous example file should
have the same preamble as your original sources.

Subject: [texhax] Positioning of tables
Message-ID: <C462F49E.5713%dafshartous@med.miami.edu>



All,

I have a latex paper with several sections within an appendix.
The first section is a series of tables, each started as follows:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}

The next section is some computer code, started as follows:

\newpage
\section{Computer Code}


Unfortunately, when I compile the document, the computer code gets mixed in
with the tables, i.e., some of the tables appear after the computer code.
I've also tried to insert the [h] with \begin{tabular}[h], but this doesn't
seem to help either.

Any suggestions much appreciated.

remember that [h] does NOT mean instert here, it means try to insert it 
here, and if your figure or table is very big just specifying [h] is 
even worse.

I recommend always using [htbp]

but to solce your problem, simply use

\clearpage instead of \newpage

You can substitutute "\newpage" with "\clearpage". This will output all 
pending tables and start a new page for the Computer Code section.

Preview is apple's default pdf reader, it works well enough that
people generally don't install another. *Printing* this sort of
doc is the only problem I've ever had with it.

I'd have gotten back earlier, but I don't have access to the
printer over weekends, and this was a 3 day weekend here, which
left a lot of catchup work for yesterday.

Yes, Adobe Reader prints the doc fine, as does gv; a colleague of
mine pointed out that if you use the ps driver vs the Lexmark c534
driver, it works (with preview). That is a solution that has been
used here, today, for new docs that have the problem. Downside of
using the ps driver is no duplex printing and probably lacking
other features.

That is odd. Per prior email, I am able to print/view the doc with
gv and/or Acrobat Reader; which has the advantage of printing
(headings et al) duplex vs using the ps driver for the printer...
which works with preview.

I'm pretty sure these are the fonts you are referring to, but GrotesqueMT
isn't in there (I don't think):

this mac has MS Office for Mac installed as well, *lots* of fonts
but I still don't see GrotesqueMT. My initial thought of the
problem was the printer doesn't have the fonts native, but I was
surprised they weren't substituted or transmitted over the printing
protocol.

I had only minimal latex tools to support (pdflatex and TexShop)
but now I have installed texlive from MacPorts. and now I have all
the programs (well pdf2ps). I tried using t1ascii on the doc, but
couldn't get much utility out of it..

I suspect Quark (which I don't have a copy of) is the center of
the problem, but I'm happy to dig deeper if you have some idea for
me to try.

This is because plain TeX (and, I assume, your macros) insert \strut
on the last line of the footnote, to make spacing between consecutive
footnotes consistent.  You've changed \baselineskip and font size, but
haven't changed \strut's definition.  So you get a default \strut
suitable for the default \baselineskip and default font size.  So, set
up \strut accordingly, probably in your \rmfnote macro.

I think you misunderstand the meaning of \lineskip -- it is not
distance between base lines, it is glue inserted between two lines.
This means you'll get 10pt of space before the last footnote line,
which contains a \strut and therefore triggers the \lineskiplimit
case.

Thank you very much. I'll go read up about the \strut command.

Let's put it another way.  With normal lines, spaced down by the normal 
amount of baselineskip, lineskip is not supposed to come into play at 
all.  \lineskip is a safety value to be used if the upper line would for 
some reason bleed into the lower line.  In most normal setting, 
\lineskip never gets called into play. 

I had trouble with footnote lineskip for a while, but I made sure that I 
had a strut whose height is proportional to the font.  That is, if you 
were setting 10 on 13, you determine what is the tallest ascender value 
at 10 point and what is the deepest descender value.  You can derive 
that from the AFM.  Let's say that the tallest ascender value is 8 pt, 
and the deepest descender value is 2pt.  Then the "height"  of the strut 
must be 8/10 x 13 and the "depth" must be 2/10 x 13.  (height = 10.4pt, 
depth = 2.6pt).

So the strut to be added to the end of the footnote will be \hrule 
height 10.4pt depth 2.6pt width 0pt, and if this is automatically added 
to the end of each footnote, succeeding footnotes will always end up 
spaced correctly.  (Careful macro writing can make the hard-coded values 
in the above calculation disappear, but you do need to find a way to 
capture the AFM ascender and descender values. ) 

Once you have done that, the safest value for \lineskip is 0pt.  It 
should never be needed.

Views and prints fine on my Mac, OS 10.5.3, with Preview.

You should try clearing the font caches?

At this point I think it's the print driver (or possibly pre
processing the driver data).  Because I don't have any problem
when I use my printer as a ps printer. When I use the Lexmark C534
print driver, that print copy has missing text.

Presumably other print drivers have the problem too (tm).

Hi George,

Just coming in late to the conversation here.

This is a problem that turns up from time to time with pdfs that are  
produced from, for example, QXP. I usually see the problem on files  
printed from Windows PCs rather than Macs and the problem appearing on  
Canon printers rather than, say, HP.

I think you are right that the problem is likely related to the  
printer driver. Have you tried printing to the same printer with just  
the generic ps driver? Normally printer drivers are able to fudge  
missing fonts from your system by using the font outlines in the pdf,  
but that is not always successful and so you get blanks. Lesser  
drivers are less able to do this successfully.

When I have had this problem I have in the past found the easiest  
solution is to postscript and distill the file, and let the distiller  
or printer driver use default fonts from the system. Not always pretty  
but at least you can read what is supposed to be in there. If you want  
to replace the fonts with something that is similar to what was there  
originally then you can usually set the fonts to replace specific ones  
that are missing in the Distiller prefs.

An alternative, if you have Illustrator handy, is to open the file and  
replace missing fonts that way.

Umm, another way may be to save the file as a tiff from Preview and  
print that.

Good luck

Alan

Or use Adobe Reader's ``Print as Image'' functionality which will RIP  
the pages to bitmaps and send those to the print driver.

I've never been successfull with multi page tiff files.
Always seem to have a problem printing more than the
first page, not sure if I even tried using Preview for
that. ...probably just "lpr <multipage.tiff"

what's the most native way to process tiffs? I know
little about them accept I think they are loss less,
uncompressed, bitmaps. Is that right?

hello,

i'd like to look my \today date exactly like

dec 12th 2008

the month must consist of only 3 small letters and the "th" ("st", "nd"
respectively) of the day must not be a superscript but on the same level
like the rest. i played around with the datetime package and ifthenelse
statements, but didn't succeed. any hints are very much appreciated!

Message-ID: <ada6dab00805301201g4e636e8dp636bd7a2109e53d5@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
i'm writing to you, because it's quite hard to preceise to whom to
write with my issue.

My name's Piotr Turkowski, i'm a student and i come from Poland. I'm
working on pretty advanced project, which in the end will give an
engineering tool to calculate structures made of reinforced concrete,
and if this will work, there will be probably one more for steel
constructions. The program will be platform independant by using Qt4
platform, and as a result it will generate raport from its
calculations and as you probably feel - it will contain a lot of
equations. Therefore i've decided to use TeX as a tool to make those
equtions look good. I plan to write simple *.tex files and convert
them to pdf. I dont know yet if it will be possible to do it like: tex
-> pdf, or tex -> dvi -> ps ->pdf, or any other way - the final result
has to be a pdf file. This is dictated by the platform and program
indepent policy which i try to input on the project. PDF being the
most spred exchange file format is the most suitable solution for me.

My question is: is it possible to include tools like dvips or pdfTeX
in this project ? What i need is to link them directly in my
application or have them as a small command line tool, which will be
called after generating .tex file, either way is okay, but this
program has to be distributed with the program i'm working on. Meaning
it can't be required by program, it has to provide it, so the end-user
will not need to take care of it.

The program is going to be open source, licenced (most probably) under
GNU/GPL v3 and it's going to be written in C++. It's going to be my
master's thesis in 2 years.

For the final notes: I have all the required knowledge to make this
program run good calcuations, but my programming skills are just
enough to make the user interface and write all the algorythms used in
engineering/calculating constructions. Being it possible to use
pdftex, which i find most suitable for my purposes, can i count on
some help linking it with my program ?

Thank you for all the help.

Here is one way of doing it:

\usepackage[normal]{engord}  %% from the Oberdiek bundle at CTAN

\def\today{\ifcase\the\month \or
  Jan\or Feb\or Mar\or Apr\or May\or Jun\or Jul\or Aug\or Sep\or

Yep, that'll do it too :)

In fact any pdf reader that can print or save as a bitmap ought to do  
it.

Actually they can be very lossy, if you use lzw compression, which I  
never use. But they can have pretty much any resolution you may  
require, depending on whether you have straight out black and white or  
colour in your file.

I usually find 300dpi for greyscale and colour images is good enough  
for printing. 1200dpi for lineart.

I've not had any problems with printing multipage tiffs myself, which  
you should be able to print from Preview itself.

Cheers
Alan
