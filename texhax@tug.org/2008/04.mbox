Subject: [texhax] LaTeX package for boxes/forms?
Message-ID: <2d460de70803311859s45d71242t27936a2a55da9f09@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to recreate my own version of
http://dediserver.eu/downloads/example.pdf
for which I need two things:

1) A way to create nested boxes which align nicely, preferably with
nice captions in
them.
2) A way to create the dotted lines, preferably with 2.5 mm distance
in the printed
version.

I do know LaTeX, but I never had to do this kind of formatting, so I
simply don't know
what to do. Looking around CTAN did not yield anything of value (to me, with my
limited knowledge of boxes etc in LaTeX), either :/


Any and all help appreciated :)
Richard

Would it be possible to automatically put the rotated box in the right
position? For example, if we do

\rotatebox{180}{B}oo

you get something like

  oo
 B

(where the B is rotated upside down), whereas I'd prefer
 
 Boo

with the B rotated but the top of the B on the baseline.

>From the "Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List", p57:

Reflecting and rotating existing symbols
   A common request on comp.text.tex is for a reversed or rotated version of an
existing symbol. As a last resort, these effects can be achieved with the
graphicx (or graphics) package?s \reflectbox and \rotatebox macros. For example,
\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{$\iota$}

Presumably, the trick to get stuff at the right height is the "origin" parameter.

It suggests that if you're worried about every output format/renderer doing the
right thing, you should instead try to find an actual upside-down font glyph.

I sent this to Bryan yesterday, but I thought I'd resend to the list  
because it also answers the alignment question.  With the rotating  
package you can rotate characters but keep the baseline where you  
want it.

Dear Byran,

Good question.  It's a little bit tricky because TeX is used to  
putting characters on a page, and once you start rotating characters  
they're not regular characters anymore.  You need a graphical  
solution, which then becomes dependent on the post-TeX processing  
methods (e.g., dvips or pdftex).

If you use regular LaTeX and dvips, try the rotate package.  In  
pdfLaTeX, this works:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{rotating}% provides a rotate environment
\newcommand{\rotxc}[1]{\begin{sideways}#1\end{sideways}}
\newcommand{\invert}[1]{\rotxc{\rotxc{#1}}}

\begin{document}
\begin{itemize}
\item regular B
\item rotate \rotxc B
\item invert \invert B
\end{itemize}
\end{document}

Hope that helps!

\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{B}oo

The 'graphicx' docs list all the options.

That 'sort of' puts the top of the B on the baseline, but not really
(it's a little above it).

If you need something more visually perfect than this then you will
need to define (probably for each class of letter shapes and each font)
precisely what you do mean by 'rotate' and 'invert' for a glyph (easy
ones to start with(??:-) are '=''-' '+'.

In other words: where is the 'correct baseline' of the glyph 'inverted-B'?
Where did the font designer intend it to be?  Would you dare ask her?

Have fun!

Just an idea -- if you don't get help from this list, you might try
this:

  http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Translation_requests

At least for the Latin based scripts, you might be able to typeset the

Message-ID: <FF317E8D-F524-44EE-BE54-55C9D3B623EA@physics.unige.ch>

Hi,

I tried multibib, multibbl, and bibunits, but none of these could
apparently do what I want. Here is the problem.

I have a document reporting on six different projects. In each
project I want an independent bibliography (that is: independent
numeric numbering and independent treatment of identical references
cited in different projects). This is a case for bibunits.

However I need something more that bibunits cannot do: in each
project there are two kinds of citations, the citations of
publications resulting from the project itself, and the citations of
other publications unrelated to the project. Theses two kinds of
citations must share a common numbering inside each project, but
must appear in distinct lists of references at the end of each project
report. If I had only one project this would be a case for multibib
without the 'resetlabels' option. But with several projects the
numbering of citations is not restarted at each project, and
furthermore the labels for citations to identical references in
different projects are mixed.

It seems that a combination of bibunits and multibib would do the
trick, but no idea how to achieve this.

Thanks for your help.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I really hope you can assist me. I have WinEdt v5.5 and have only recently
been using it on my computer. The problem I have is that when I use BibTex,
the reference article come up in the reference section, but in the text
body, there is (?) in place of the usual numbering. In the preamble, I have
the following:

\documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{amsart}
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,euscript,epsfig,graphics,harvard}

and before \end{document}, I have:


\bibliography{publications}
\bibliographystyle{agsm}

Where publications.bib is my list of references and the file agsm.bst is in
both the program files for Winedt, and in the folder where the document I'm
trying to compile is.

Can you please tell me why I am experiencing this and what may be the
problem?

Thanking you in advance.

Kindest regards,
Lisa Majmin.

If you mean the application (program) Scientific WorkPlace, here it is

http://www.mackichan.com/

but I find rather perplexing your statement about a Russian version.

Unfortunately (I think ---I've never tried SWP), there is no Mac  
version of Scientific Word/WorkPlace. Maybe there will be, but I  
don't know. It could run with Windows on a Mac, though (Boot Camp,  
Parallels or VMWare Fusion).

Sorry for asking, but have you typeset your file at least twice in a  
row? LaTeX needs to runs at least for inserting the cited reference  
in your DVI or PDF file.


Again, sorry if that's not the case.

List archives? A minimal longtable works like any LaTeX table,
so follow any ordinary LaTeX guide. Have you tried this? E.g.:

Look into ``The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX'', pp. 41 & ff.:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf

Chances are you already have it ---in your terminal or at the Command  
Prompt type

texdoc lshort

Also, TUG India ``LaTeX Primer'', pp. 62 & ff.:

http://sarovar.org/frs/?group_id=48&release_id=105

is an excellent manual.

Hi all.

I need to put a lot of chemical structure formulae (mostly organic compounds) 
in my LaTeX document.
Until now, I used to draw the structures in a drawing software (Xfig) and then 
to include the eps version of the drawing with \includegraphics.
But I'm considering to do it directly in my LaTeX document.
Which package would you recommend me? chemtex, ochem, something else?

Thank you,
Nat?rcia

I guess it is source specials they can be used for returning back to the 
source code in your editor.

I don't use Yap myself, but you might be able to tell yap to ignore spurce 
specials, otherwise tell your editor not to use source specials

... or simply, again Andy Robert's tutorial page on tables:

     http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/latextutorial4.html

However, I doubt that you will find such a parameter there
(I guess this is why Bryan Lepore is asking here).
The width of ordinary c, l, r cells is the maximal width of entries there,
the width of p{<width>} cells is <width>.

Something in the direction of such a parameter comes with tabular*
and its refinements or variants (may perhaps been considered so).

There are many sophisticated packages for tables some of which
provide a number of extra parameters:

     ftp://www.dante.de/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#tables

However, one should rather start with simple questions, like:
For which purpose do you need such a parameter?
It may turn out that you don't need such a parameter for your purpose.
The question may then have been an instance of

     http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#goal

thanks for the pointers - i need to think about this more.  however ;

> http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#goal

i was avoiding this - but here goes :

i have some cells in a tabular env. that are very wide up at the top, then 
down below i really don't need them so wide.  i'd rather not have to 
insert all sorts of p{} and such (need to think more here), and i have 
seen these '\renewcommand's peppered around the internet that looked 
interesting.

i was hoping i could simply reset the width where i want as i proceed in 
the table.

General remark: YAP is part of MiKTeX, and there is a mailing list for 
MiKTeX users,
where you may find people who know more about YAP than here:

     <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/miktex-users>

Another remark at the occasion: last June the printing range bug of YAP
from MiKTeX 2.5 and 2.6 was dealt with here. I have installed MiKTeX 2.7 
recently,
where the printing range bug is fixed. You might consider just updating 
MiKTeX.

I would not be a good idea, and as \begin{align*} is actually looking for 
the literal string '\end{align*}' I don't think it is possible.

If typing \begin{align*} all the time is tedious, I would recommend 
switching to a better editor.

Note also that using

\begin{align*}
...
\end{align*}

makes the code a lot easier to read than using

$$
...
$$

or as most $$-users do

$$...$$

On a different note, it is not a good idea to use align* for one-liners 
(such as $$...$$) since align is not aware of the length of the line of 
text just before the math display, whereas equation(*) is, and equation(*) 
therefore is able to re-adjust it position acordingly (which uses the 
space on the page a lot better).

As you seem to be danish, I would recommend my Danish LaTeXbook

Now it becomes nice and perhaps starts exceeding my knowledge.

I guess you hoped that a long one-line entry at the beginning of the table
could be broken into two lines within the cell if you "co-erce" the cell
to be less wide.

Unable to remember sophisticated packages I once briefly investigated
(having similar difficulties), and agreeing that p{...} is not nice,
I would just try this:

If you want to have two lines (or more) in a certain cell,
typeset the cell as a (nested) one-column tabular environment
\begin{tabular}{c}<first cell line>\\<second cell line>\end{tabular}
This way the column width is not arbitrary but just as small as
possible. You will get problems with vertical spacing,
you might use \\[...] to have less inter-line space within the cell
than between cells, and you may need additional space
on top and at bottom of the inner table (cellspace or tbles or bigstrut).
You may make a shorthand macro \brokencell for that inner kind
of tables.

Good luck,

   Uwe.

Probably...but not easy. You'll have to change the catcode of $ to make
it into an active character (not too difficult, but requires familiarity
with low-level TeX), then define macros that expand to the right thing
depending on whether you're opening or closing the environment (no idea
how :) The flexisym and breqn packages from the mh bundle (available on
CTAN) might give you some pointers.

It will undoubtedly be easier to define $$ to be a smart short-cut that
inserts \begin{align*} or \end{align*} as appropriate, assuming you're
using a decent editor (e.g. emacs, vim, or something fairly programmable
-- no flame wars about the definition of "decent", please :)

If you were prepared to use \[...\] instead of $$...$$, then it would
probably just be a case of (untested):

\renewcommand{\[}{\begin{align*}
\renewcommand{\]}{\end{align*}

Argghhh!  This is not a good suggestion: LaTeX will bomb out on finding \[
in the text because, as Lars said, \begin{align*} needs to find \end{align*}
and it won't.  (Also both \renewcommand's here are missing a closing brace!)

Yes, indeed.  I assume you're using something like WinEdt and clicking on
the icon that opens the dvi at the point corresponding to the current cursor
position.  I don't think you can use the this facility and turn off the dot
at the same time.  So, either don't use the facility (and disable source
specials) or try moving the cursor a little further down the page (probably
the more sensible option).

No professional chemist that I know would use any of the LaTeX packages
to draw 2-dimensional representations of chemical compounds; none of
these packages have the ability to properly capture structural features.
In addition they are unsuitable for occasional use or for student use
because inter alia they lack intelligence ... for example about the
valence of an element.

 

Use proper chemical structure software such as the freeware IsisDraw
(Windows) to produce publication quality drawings whether eps or
whatever.

Message-ID: <20080408202929.34f9154d.padawan12@obiwannabe.co.uk>

Dear tex hackers,

When I started writing I was unsure of whether to use the word "figure",
"diagram", "fig" or whatever, so I decided to defer that decision until
later. Throughout the text all references are given as \ref{fig:foobar},
or \ref{tab:atable} and so forth.

Now, I want to automatically prepend the word "Fig" or "Table" to each
reference depending on the three characters that appear before the colon.

Such that

In \ref{fig:dataflow1654} you can see ...

Becomes

In Fig 1.2 you can see ...


and likewise for table references of the form \ref{tab:table345} which
would become

In Table 1.7 a summary is given ...

Is it possible to redefine \ref to do this?

Gratefully in anticipation of any help,

Andy

Well you have to, in some form or other, decide what size is the transition
between "very wide" and "not so wide".  You may as well use p{} for them
all.  I am assuming you want the wider entries to be broken into multiple
lines, and the shorter entries to remain intact.

If this means you want to change the column widths part way through the
table, that is not going to work -- it is just the opposite of what a table
is supposed to be.

My crystal ball suggests you are looking for the tabulary package.

here is a rough example:

\documentclass{article}

\newcommand{\origref}{}
\let\origref\ref

\newcommand{\splitref}{}
\def\splitref #1:#2\relax{{%
  \def\a{#1}%

You got an answer to this question, but did you know that
LaTeX already knows if it is a figure or table, regardless 
of the tag?   Just use that:

\makeatletter
\def\p at figure{Fig~}
\def\p at table{Table~}
\makeatother

Oh oh.  Then you will have to make two separate tabular environments,
or use a tabbing environment.

I think tabulary is better than changing column widths, but it sounds
like it isn't what you seek.


I recall "supertabular" had the behavior that the column widths
were set independently for each page of its multi-page tables.

Sorry to have another question so soon,

This is aimed at Donald, who I belive may know the answer, but
all other suggestions are welcome.

I once posted about a problem with orphaned section and subsection

an effect, some of which didn't, but none completely solved the problem.

So, still stuck with this, and I want to attack it again. 

Using picins (\parpic) to create paragraphs which begin with a
wrapped figure and text flowing around it.


For example:

\subsection{Random selection}
\pargraf{images/puredata/random-select}{Random select}{fig:randomselect}{0.6}{r}{12pt}
\noindent
To choose one of several events with uniform probability a combination...


which calls (defined elsewhere)

% Main side graphic, left or right
\newcommand{\pargraf}[6]{
\captionsetup{font=footnotesize, labelfont=bf}
\piccaption{#2\label{#3}}
\pichskip{#6}
\parpic[#5]{\includegraphics[angle=0, scale=#4]{#1}}
}

So, what happens is this... very often the heading (usually a subsection) is
orphaned and everything starts on the next page. This happens even when
there is plenty of room on the previous page.

\clubpenalty etc have absolutely no effect.


\parpic is essential, I cannot change this as the indented text contains
other small figures and hence \wrapfig is unsuitable.


Research led me to this problem which seems relevant. In this case
the author is having trouble with enumerated lists causing a similar
problem.

http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.text.tex/2006-09/msg00149.html

where Michael Rolfe writes:

>> and a page break occurs between the paragraph header and the first
>> \item in the list. That is, the paragraph header is an orphan.


Donald Arseneau replies:

> The \paragraph command puts the title at the start of a

> considered an orphan.


Donald then goes on to provide a solution 

\paragraph{Xyz}~~\par
\makeatletter\@afterheading\makeatother
\begin{enumerate}


So, I have my figure code wrapped in a new command that embeds \parpic
and what I would like is modify this to ***FORBID*** LaTeX from breaking
a page immediately after a subsection heading (whatever the cost - if problems
arise I will have to edit the text at that point)

Unfortunately I don't understand \makeatletter, \makeatother.

Will happily provide links to source and output examples if this helps.

Thankyou all again for help solving this annoying problem and sorry to
keep pestering with it, unfortunately the previous suggestions failed, I think
this is a more subtle problem.

Dear Andy,

unfortunately I cannot help you with your overall problem, but at least I
can answer one of the questions.

They just change the way TeX handles the @ (at). After \makeatletter, you
can use @ as part of a command name; \makeatother reverts that again.

Better, perhaps,

\makeatletter
\def\p at figure{Fig.~}
\def\p at table{Table~}
\makeatother

since "g" is not the final letter of "Figure".

Ah, sorry! I did say it was untested, but I should have been less lazy 
and tested it before posting. I suppose one could try to make \[ look 
for \], expand the latter once into \end{align*}, and the former once 
into \begin{align*}. But it's a lot of work, and as others have said, 
setting up an editor shortcut key sounds like a better solution.

Better still(?), use one of the many existing packages that let you do 
this. The fancyref package does exactly what you asked for: adds a 
string before cross-references (e.g. "Figure") that depends on the label 
prefix, i.e. the part before the colon in \label{fig:foobar}. All you 
have to do is define the strings and prefixes.

Or you could use the cleveref package, which adds the correct string 
irrespective of the label. E.g. if you changed a figure into a table, 
but forgot to rename \label{fig:foobar}, it would add "Table" instead of 
"Figure", even though the label uses the wrong prefix. It can do this 
because, as Donald Arseneau wrote, LaTeX already knows if it's a figure 
or table, or (with a bit of work) equation or theorem or list item etc. 
(Disclosure of interest: I'm the author of cleveref.)

HTH,

Toby

I usually load various packages to help me with tables, and then I  
decide which one to use, depending on each table:

\usepackage{tabularx}
\usepackage{tabulary}
[...]
\usepackage{multirow}
\usepackage{array}
\usepackage{dcolumn}

I dare to insist in my recommendation of the excellent TUG India  
tutorials:

http://www.tug.org.in/tutorials.html

Chapters 6-8 (just a few pages long) cover tables.

Probably...but not easy. You'll have to change the catcode of $ to make 
it into an active character (not too difficult, but requires familiarity 
with low-level TeX), then define macros that expand to the right thing 
depending on whether you're opening or closing the environment (no idea 
how :) The flexisym and breqn packages from the mh bundle (available on 
CTAN) might give you some pointers.

It will undoubtedly be easier to define $$ to be a smart short-cut that 
inserts \begin{align*} or \end{align*} as appropriate, assuming you're 
using a decent editor (e.g. emacs, vim, or something fairly programmable 
-- no flame wars about the definition of "decent", please :)

If you were prepared to use \[...\] instead of $$...$$, then it would 
probably just be a case of (untested):

\renewcommand{\[}{\begin{align*}
\renewcommand{\]}{\end{align*}

Subject: [texhax] Suppressing pagebreak after a list
Message-ID: <1207872503.4708.41.camel@sony-sjs.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk>

Dear All,

Thanks to this forum, I found Paul Taylor's \pushright solution which
puts a qed square flush right on a line (or flushright on the next line
if there's not enough room). This was easy to modify for use in an exam
class that assigns marks to questions. It sets widowpenalties to 10000
to ensure that a pagebreak doesn't separate the theorem from the square.

I've now hit something similar but worse. At the end of each question, I
calculate the total marks which likewise goes flushright (again I use
pushright to do this). However, the class sets up newenvironments for
questions and subquestions. The subquestions are a simple list. The
questions are essentially items of a list, but set up things in the
\begin{question} like zeroing the marks, re-setting equation numbers to
zero, setting footer information, etc. And the \end{question} then puts
the total marks on a line, modifies the footer, and other things before
throwing a page and moving to the next question.

My problem is that I can't suppress a pagebreak before the total marks,
I think because the end of the subquestion list is always identified by
latex as a good pagebreak location. 

Here's what my code looks like:

...
\begin{question}
  \begin{subquestions}
     \item How much is 2+2?  \qmarks{3}
     \item How much is 4+4?  \qmarks{4}
  \end{subquestions}
\end{question}  
       % this generates a line:  [Total 7 marks] using pushright
...

Here's the structure of my question and subquestion environments
(stripped down slightly and without definitions of my counters and
things):

\newenvironment{question}%
  { \setcounter{nmarks}{0}
    % etc.
    \item%
    \markboth{\textit{[This question continues overleaf \ldots]}}{}%
  }
{\pushright{\sffamily[Total~\arabic{nmarks}}]}  % <<<<<<<---------
   \ifthenelse{\equal{\thepage}{\pageref{icphexam at last}}}%
    {\markboth{\textbf{End of examination paper}}{}}%
    {\markboth{\textbf{Please turn over}}{}}
    \par
    \pagebreak}%

\newenvironment{subquestions}%
  {\begin{list}{(\roman{subqno})}{\usecounter{subqno}}}%
  {\end{list}}%


Is there any (simple) way to force the arrowed line to not find itself
alone on the next page?

Thanks
Steve

I doubt the "plenty" part.  

Get picins fixed so it does not break the page when \@nobreak has been set.

It isn't.

It is already forbidden, but picins apparently ignores it: I see
\pagebreak in the code, but no \if at nobreak.

Okay

I wrapped it in a conditional thus:

\ifdim\d at hoehe>\d at tmp%
   \vskip 0pt plus\d at hoehe\relax%
   \if at nobreak\else\pagebreak[3]\fi%
   \vskip 0pt plus-\d at hoehe\relax%
   \ifnum\c at picpos=1\c at picpos=0\else\c at picpos=\@changemode\fi%
 \fi%

Seems to work properly now. 

Thankyou Donald.

Subject: [texhax] Q: how to generate PS font from MF input?
Message-ID: <47FF97FA.4070201@gmail.com>

I have an old file (from 1994) that originally used a home-grown metafont
font, for which I have the source.

Now that I'm trying to render the output as PDF with pdftex. So I think
that means that I have to have the font available as a Type 1 font. I've
googled around, and it appears that metapost is the right program to use
for this task, but I can't find any explanation of how exactly to use it to
create a PS version of the font. Does anyone have a pointer to a detailed
example of how to do this?

Metapost will allow you to make a vector outline of the font's glyphs,  
it won't directly make a computer font. Metatype1 however, will do  
what you want:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/metatype1/

But you don't necessarily need to do this --- pdflatex will include a  
Metafont as bitmaps, which can be made to be print-ready if need be w/  
the appropriate tools.

The installation says "move the resulting mf2pt1.mem file someplace where
metapost can find it".

I've tried all kinds of places, but mf2pt1 keeps complaining that it can't
find it. Do you have any idea where it should go?

Are there any directions anywhere?

I just rebuilt the font from my pal10.mf source. So I now have a
"pal10.2602gf" file. But I don't know what would be the right tools to make
this usable by pdftex :-(

I see that I can open this font in FontForge, and can use FontForge to
create a .pfb file. Now I have pfb, afm and tfm files. I sort of think that
that might be all I need. But I have no idea where to put them so that
pdftex can find and use them.

dear list,

I'm using book as documentclass. Everything is working fine except for the 
biliography.
unfourtunately the heading of my bibliography is always taken from the last 
chapter.
Obviously that is not something I want.
I want it as a chapter but with a bibliography-style.
I couldn't find any solution in the archives or via google.
Can someone give my an advice.

thanks,

christian

dear alex,

your solution works. and of course I meant header. :-)

one further issue:

I want latex to treat the bibliography as a chapter. both in the table of 
contents and that it should start on an uneven page.

Maybe you mean TeX Live:

http://www.tug.org/texlive/

I never tried, but here it says it can be run directly from the DVD:

I suggested that the thread "Running LaTex off a stick." from early 
december 2007 might be relevant. 

(stick as in USB memory stick)

That would be nice, and I think perfectly feasible, as Mandriva sells  
a whole OS in a USB flash:

http://news.softpedia.com/news/Mandriva-Flash-Available-41825.shtml

Maybe TUG could sell these ready to use memory sticks, with logo and  
all.

Subject: [texhax] using \vinphantom
Message-ID: <9f264ca20804131950r294915eha7958da7a63e6c91@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,
Two distinct questions:

(1)

with
\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{verse}

the command

\vinphantom doesn't seem available.

It works with

\documentclass{memoir}

Without using memoir, is there a way to get \vinphantom?


(2)

I would like to subtract the value of \vinphantom from a fixed value to
create an offset inline. I started out with:

\poemtitle{Amor vs Odio}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{??diame! mmmmmm ?No lo odies!}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
??diame!\vinphantom{??diame!}\hspace{6em} ?No lo odies!\\
Porque vengo\vinphantom{Porque vengo}\hspace{6em}??mame!\\
del naciente\vinphantom{del naciente} \hspace{6em}??malo!\\
??dialo!\vinphantom{??dialo!}\hspace{6em}?Am?monos!\\

Then realized I need to subtract the \vinphantom value from the fixed em
value so that the remainder of each line is lined up as if with a tab.

I know there is a tabbing environment, but would like to take this
opportunity to learn something more general about how to subtract variable
values...

Actually, the tabbing environement is not a good solution in this case
anyways it seems because it creates its own indent and a line break with the
rest of the poem...

Although, as Axel says, you can run TL mostly from DVD, there's still an
installation step and a hard disk directory is required.

Perhaps you mean to run TeX from a USB stick.  If this is Windows, you
might find http://www.exomatik.net/LaTeX/USBTeXEnglish to be what you
want.

Best,

Probably trivial for someone who uses tables more often than I do :)

\documentclass[12pt]{memoir}
\usepackage{array}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}



\setlength{\extrarowheight}{12pt}
\setlength{\arrayrulewidth}{0.5pt}
\begin{tabular}%
     {|c|c|}
\hline
$\updelta (x-y) \psi_2(y)^tQ_{2y}$ &
$e^{ih^{-1}\langle x-y,\xi\rangle }q_2(y,\xi ,h)$\\
\hline
$\updelta (t)$ & $1$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


I want

1) to increase the vertical space between equation and the following
\hline (putting switch [t] in {tabular} does not help; actually I want
pretty high cells with [c] vertical alignment

2) to increase the horizontal size of cells (with the same [c]
horizontal alignment;

I want to achieve it by setting parameters, not by adding some spaces
and seps in the cells manually.

Thank you in advance

as far as I know one of the short commings of the times that comes with 
LaTeX is that it is mussing the bold math fonts.

try using the bm package, and use

$\bm{x}$

maybe \boldmath even works now (I never user boldmath so I don't know).

Well, having spent a happy three hours over the weekend trying to get either:

1. pdftex to understand that I have created a type 1 version from the mf
source using fontforge; or

2. pdftex to build/use a bitmapped version of my font

I am now ready to scream and throw my computer against something extremely
hard.

How can it be this hard? Can't someone please tell me where to put the
various files so pdftex can find them?

This whole thing seems to be made considerably more confusing by the fact
that almost all the google hits refer to LaTeX; and many others seem to be
trying to solve the problem of allowing fonts to be used by tex rather than
pdftex.

I have managed to put everything back the way that it was when I started
this fiasco, so at least I haven't broken anything, but I'm certainly no
closer to getting pdftex to be able to compile my TeX file.

To recap:

1. I have an old plain tex file that refers to a font called pal10.
2. I have the MF source for pal10.
3. I am trying to pdftex to compile the plain tex file.

At this point I don't care whether pdftex ends up using the type 1 version
or a bitmapped version.

Naively, it seems like I should just be able to put pal10.mf somewhere and
pdftex should be able to do everything necessary.

That's the default if it doesn't find a map entry for the font.
Does it find the tfm? And what TeX distribution on which OS are you using?

dear list,

I'm using book as documentclass. Everything is working fine except for

unfourtunately the heading of my bibliography is always taken from the

Obviously that is not something I want.
I want it as a chapter but with a bibliography-style.
I couldn't find any solution in the archives or via google.
Can someone give my an advice.

If memory serves, it does that if the .mf is in the same directory as  
the .tex file.

To install the Type 1 font, you'll need to put the files in a texmf  
tree and if necessary update the filename database / hash.

Dr. Ivrii,

If you rearrange your commands slightly (you have two \begin{tabular}
commands, for one thing), your \setlength commands should do what you
need.

The following worked for me:

\documentclass[12pt]{memoir}
\usepackage{array}

\begin{document}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering{
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{12pt}
\setlength{\arrayrulewidth}{0.5pt}
\begin{tabular}%
     {|c|c|}
\hline
$\updelta (x-y) \psi_2(y)^tQ_{2y}$ &
$e^{ih^{-1}\langle x-y,\xi\rangle }q_2(y,\xi ,h)$\\ 
\hline 
$\updelta (t)$ & $1$\\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular} 
}
\end{table}

\end{document}


I hope that helps.

The first page of an article is traditionally set without a title in the

issue \thispagestyle{headings} just before issuing \maketitle.

Wow! Thank you, thank you, thank you.

There I was, messing with all kinds of things in ~/texmf and /.texmf-var; I
never for a moment thought of putting the .mf file in the same directory as
the .tex file.

Just to satisfy my curiosity...

I see that pdftex has created two bitmapped versions of the font:
./pal10.720pk and ./pal10.600pk. According to the log, it seems to use only
the former of these. How does pdftex figure out what dpi should be
generated and/or used for bitmapped fonts created with mf?

Hi,

I want to put a separate header on the title page (i.e., 1st page) which is
different from the header on odd and even numbered pages. Let me explain my problem
with the commands I have used in my Latex document of 4 pages.

\documentclass[psfig,twocolumn,twoside]{article}
\usepackage{psfig}
\usepackage{fancyheadings}
...
...
...

The following commands are used for all even and odd numbered pages and I can
achieve it.

\pagestyle{fancyplain}
\lhead[{\small Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for 2-D Dot Pattern Matching Problem}\\]{}
\rhead[]{{\small Proceedings of the National Conference CSI-RDHS 2008}\\}
\lfoot[{\small \copyright ~~Computer Society of India, 2008}]
      {{\small \copyright ~~Computer Society of India, 2008}}
\cfoot[]{}
...
...
...

Now the following commands are used for the first page of the article. But the
moment I use these commands, the header of the first page and the 3rd page of the
article are changed. But I want the first page header as follows and it is different
from other page header. Please help me out.

\thispagestyle{fancyplain}
\rhead[]{\fancyplain{}{{\small Proceedings of the National Conference on} \\
               {\small Research and Development in Hardware \& System} \\
               {\small (CSI-RDHS 2008)} \\
               {\small June 20-21, 2008, Kolkata, India}}}

Gautam

You're using an old package, fancyheadings; its author, Piet van  
Oostrum, has ask us to use his new package fancyhdr.

(By the way, also psfig is old ---the recommendation is to use  
graphicx.)

You define a page style here

> \lhead[{\small Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for 2-D Dot Pattern  
> Matching Problem}\\]{}
> \rhead[]{{\small Proceedings of the National Conference CSI-RDHS  
> 2008}\\}

[...]

and then redefine the right head of the **same page style** here  
(that's why the 3rd page header changes as well):

> \thispagestyle{fancyplain}
> \rhead[]{\fancyplain{}{{\small Proceedings of the National

In your terminal or Command Prompt type

texdoc fancyhdr <return>

to see the documentation of fancyhdr.sty. See how to define your  
general page styles and then ***see, in p. 7, how to define your  
plain page style***, so you can have the first page of your article  
as you want it.


Best,

Axel

Hi Gautam,

Quoting G. Garai (gautam.garai at saha.ac.in):
> I want to put a separate header on the title page (i.e., 1st page) which is
> different from the header on odd and even numbered pages.

as there have not been better answers yet, I dare to offer something I once
did in one project many years ago. It might not be good, but it still
works.

What I did was to define my own page styles.

\makeatletter	% allow @ as part of command names
\def\ps at myfancyheadings{
	% add head and foot definitions for the 'normal' pages here
}
\def\ps at myspecialfancyheadings{
	% add head and foot definitions for the first page here
}
\makeatother	% revert @ to its special meaning(s)

...

% if you do that first, you can be more sloppy with what you have to
% include in your own page style definitions:
\pagestyle{fancyplain}
% now call your own page style definitions:
\pagestyle{myfancyheadings}
\thispagestyle{myspecialfancyheadings}
...

As my last encounter with fancyheadings was many years ago, I cannot tell
you what exactly is needed in those page styles.

	Susan

Thanks, Lars, for your suggestion.  I had in fact already tried bm and
given up when it clashed with the hyperref package resulting in
TeX capacity exceeded (see attached log) - the same occurs if I load
hyperref before the other packages.

If I remove hyperref it works OK.  So it looks like one has to choose
between bm and hyperref.

Wes

I'm a newbye with mac os x and mactex. Now, reading in the internet, I added

Under FreeBSD I use the command mktexlsr to update the packages.

What should I do under tje texshop of mactex?

If you mean ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/, then it is the right place.

You don't need to run mktexlsr (or its alias texhash) for anything  
you put into ~/Library/texmf, but only if you make changes to /usr/ 
local/texlive/texmf-local/.

Does kpsewhich find your file? In Terminal.app:

kpsewhich translator.sty

If you still have problems ---and even if you don't---, I would  
advise you to join the TeX on Mac OS X Mailing List:

Best,

Axel

Subject: [texhax] separate header on title page
Message-ID: <32812.172.16.0.31.1208412665.squirrel@webmail.saha.ac.in>

Hi,

I want to put a separate header on the title page (i.e., 1st page) which is
different from the header on odd and even numbered pages. Let me explain my problem
with the commands I have used in my Latex document of 4 pages.

\documentclass[psfig,twocolumn,twoside]{article}
\usepackage{psfig}
\usepackage{fancyheadings}
...
...
...

The following commands are used for all even and odd numbered pages and I can
achieve it.

\pagestyle{fancyplain}
\lhead[{\small Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for 2-D Dot Pattern Matching Problem}\\]{}
\rhead[]{{\small Proceedings of the National Conference CSI-RDHS 2008}\\}
\lfoot[{\small \copyright ~~Computer Society of India, 2008}]
      {{\small \copyright ~~Computer Society of India, 2008}}
\cfoot[]{}
...
...
...

Now the following commands are used for the first page of the article. But the
moment I use these commands, the header of the first page and the 3rd page of the
article are changed. But I want the first page header as follows and it is different
from other page header. Please help me out.

\thispagestyle{fancyplain}
\rhead[]{\fancyplain{}{{\small Proceedings of the National Conference on} \\
               {\small Research and Development in Hardware \& System} \\ {\small
(CSI-RDHS 2008)} \\
               {\small June 20-21, 2008, Kolkata, India}}}

The way to solve a segmentation fault is to run the program under a
debugger such as gdb and see where it crashes.  That may or may not be
easy in your case.

You didn't mention what version you are running.  If it is not at least
what was in TeX Live 2007, you should update.  You can get the very
latest version from pdftex.org if you're up for that.

Message-ID: <a06240806c4343a587561@[128.125.226.76]>

I'm an avid TeX Shop user and currently writing papers and a book in 
LaTeX.  I've run into one problem that I cannot completely solve.

I have a table that is much too wide for a page.  I'd like to rotate 
it 90 degrees CCW so that it will fit on a page all by itself, within 
a much larger standard document.  I suppose that I could create two 
documents with different page shapes and splice them together 
afterwards (make the unusual typeset page a graphic, rotate it, and 
then insert it with \includegraphics), but then table, and equation 
numbers, etc., within the rotated material are a problem.  Is there 
any way to rotate one table (a page) within a TeX document?   Ideally 
I would like a \tablerotate{  } command that would float the table to 
the next free page, take care of changes in the page shape and turn 
everything 90 degrees.  I assume that a similar \figurerotate{ } 
command with similar characteristics would be useful too.

Any help would be appreciated.

Try the `rotating' package, and the `sidewaystable' environment. An example

Dear all,

I'm using hyperref to generate links in my PDF files.

Would anyone have any ideas how to solve, or look for causes of, the 
following fault. I can create the PDF through DVI:

Firstable, I compile my file by latex compiler i.e.

latex my_file

and then I use the dvips converter to generate the postscript file

dvips my_file

and finally I use the Acrobat Distiller to creat the PDF file.

Most of the time this works fine, but sometimes it gives me the 
following error.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This isn't a solution per se, but have you tried creating the PDF 
directly via pdflatex? Maybe it'll work better...

First you should update ghostscript (current is 8.62) and see whether
the problem disappears. If not, you should provide a minimal example.

Subject: [texhax] Counters for tables
Message-ID: <000001c8a637$49b219c0$0300000a@flaptop>

Hey,

I have used the table environment for both figures and pseudo-code
listings, so I've had to redefine the captions to read `Figure x.x:...'
and `Listing x.x:...' depending on the context. This I managed easily,
but of course the figures and listings were numbered, say...

Figure 1.1
Listing 1.2
Listing 1.3
Figure 1.4

...instead of:

Figure 1.1
Listing 1.1
Listing 1.2
Figure 1.2

I thought the smartref package would allow me to overcome this without
much programming, maybe I've got the wrong end of the stick, but I've
still had to define separate environments for the tables, incrementing
the counters ``manually'' myself:

+++

\newcounter{pseudoctr}
\newcounter{figurectr}

\addtoreflist{pseudoctr}
\addtoreflist{figurectr}

\newcommand{\resettablecounters}%
{%
    \setcounter{pseudoctr}{0}%
    \setcounter{figurectr}{0}%
}%

\newenvironment{mypseudotable}[1]%
{%
    \addtocounter{pseudoctr}{1}%
    \begin{table}[#1]%
}%
{%
    \end{table}%
    \par%
}%

\newenvironment{myfiguretable}[1]%
{%
    \addtocounter{figurectr}{1}%
    \begin{table}[#1]%
}%
{%
    \end{table}%
    \par%
}%

+++

I call the \resettablecounters command in my custom \chapter command to
reset the counters. I've then had to define dedicated ref commands...

+++

\newcommand{\mypseudoref}[1]{\chapterref{#1}.\pseudoctrref{#1}}
\newcommand{\myfigureref}[1]{\chapterref{#1}.\figurectrref{#1}}

+++

...and redefine the captions...

+++

\usepackage[labelformat=empty]{caption}

\newcommand{\mypseudocaption}[1]%
{%
    \vspace{-1.6em}%
    \caption{Listing \thechapter.\thepseudoctr: \it#1}%
}%

\newcommand{\myfigurecaption}[1]%
{%
    \vspace{-1.6em}%
    \caption{Figure \thechapter.\thefigurectr: \it#1}%
}%

+++

Have a made a meal of this? I accept that I can practically halve the
number of newly created commands and environments by passing a second
argument to differentiate between the pseudo-code listings and figures
but before I attempt this I want to know whether I'm barking up the
wrong tree...

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,

James

Message-ID: <7F140DE91BBA4A4C8A6521FD90F04BC0086A46@CAMPUSV5.xds.umail.utah.edu>

I've searched extensively for some package / class that performs this, but have not found anything, and would greatly appreciate some help.  Here's the problem:
 
I would like to be able to type a document where I can flag certain paragraphs to be treated specially.  For example:
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
This paragraph is normal
 
\begin{special1}
  I would like this paragraph, when typeset, to appear with a "(P1)" at the very beginning of the paragraph.  If this paragraph is broken across pages, I would like the "(P1)" to appear as the first couple characters on the second page where the paragraph is broken.  Also, on any page that contains a portion of this paragraph, I would like the header and footer to say "Paragraph Type 1".
\end{special1}
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
I'm not very familiar with programming with LaTeX.  I am currently reading through The LaTeX Companion.  I do have significant programming background, but the TeX/LaTeX syntax is not like anything I've ever seen before.  I'm not even sure if something like this is possible.  
 
Do you know of anything out there that performs something similar to what I'm looking for.  If not, is LaTeX at least capable of doing something like this.  
 
Thank you so much for your help.

Message-ID: <14fe94a50804250215i26622dbft31429d60cbc0e419@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm writing a table, and used the compactenum environment provided by the
paralist package. Unfortunately, the results are slightly dissatisfactory,
as you can see from the pdf output. There's some vertical space between the
beginning of the line and that of the compactenum. Any idea how to get rid
of that space? I tried \setlength{pltopsep}{0mm} but that didn't work. Hmmm.

Thanks!

Please,

I am trying to print sticky labels to fit the centre of an audio CD,
using a recnt download of Texlive.

I have tried keying the source from Page 110 of the "Graphics
Companion", but I cannot get it to compile.

The examples from here: http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/latex/texdoc.html
(tp-test) are very sparse and do not help me.  (They print arcs OK,
but no curved text.)

When I try to download the "Graphics Companion" examples from CTAN, it
times out :-(

Other examples I have found on the 'net, help me to print for the
Jewel case, but that is not what I want.  I want to print cicular
labels.

I have bought A4 stationary that has two circular blank cut outs per
page.

Any suggestions ?

Thanks

James,

Having recently just created new environments to distinguish maps and
plates from figures, it seems to me that it would be lot simpler for you
to create a new table environment (for the listings, for instance), but
have the new environment use the same counter that your table
environment uses. Or, to use two different counters and set them equal
every time one of the environments is called, advance the counter you
just used, then (again) set them equal to each other.

Also, you might check if your documentclass supports the \numberwithin
command. For example, with amsbook:

\numberwithin{equation}{chapter} (or section or whatever you choose)
\numberwithin{figure}{chapter}
\numberwithin{table}{chapter}

If you created two new environments---one for figures and one for
listings---then if you decide to add a table at the last minute, you
won't have to redefine everything.

Susan

Hey,

I have used the table environment for both figures and pseudo-code
listings, so I've had to redefine the captions to read `Figure x.x:...'
and `Listing x.x:...' depending on the context. This I managed easily,
but of course the figures and listings were numbered, say...

Figure 1.1
Listing 1.2
Listing 1.3
Figure 1.4

...instead of:

Figure 1.1
Listing 1.1
Listing 1.2
Figure 1.2

I thought the smartref package would allow me to overcome this without
much programming, maybe I've got the wrong end of the stick, but I've
still had to define separate environments for the tables, incrementing
the counters ``manually'' myself:

+++

\newcounter{pseudoctr}
\newcounter{figurectr}

\addtoreflist{pseudoctr}
\addtoreflist{figurectr}

\newcommand{\resettablecounters}%
{%
    \setcounter{pseudoctr}{0}%
    \setcounter{figurectr}{0}%
}%

\newenvironment{mypseudotable}[1]%
{%
    \addtocounter{pseudoctr}{1}%
    \begin{table}[#1]%
}%
{%
    \end{table}%
    \par%
}%

\newenvironment{myfiguretable}[1]%
{%
    \addtocounter{figurectr}{1}%
    \begin{table}[#1]%
}%
{%
    \end{table}%
    \par%
}%

+++

I call the \resettablecounters command in my custom \chapter command to
reset the counters. I've then had to define dedicated ref commands...

+++

\newcommand{\mypseudoref}[1]{\chapterref{#1}.\pseudoctrref{#1}}
\newcommand{\myfigureref}[1]{\chapterref{#1}.\figurectrref{#1}}

+++

...and redefine the captions...

+++

\usepackage[labelformat=empty]{caption}

\newcommand{\mypseudocaption}[1]%
{%
    \vspace{-1.6em}%
    \caption{Listing \thechapter.\thepseudoctr: \it#1}%
}%

\newcommand{\myfigurecaption}[1]%
{%
    \vspace{-1.6em}%
    \caption{Figure \thechapter.\thefigurectr: \it#1}%
}%

+++

Have a made a meal of this? I accept that I can practically halve the
number of newly created commands and environments by passing a second
argument to differentiate between the pseudo-code listings and figures
but before I attempt this I want to know whether I'm barking up the
wrong tree...

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,

James

Josh,

I don't know if there is a package or documentclass that will do this
type of thing for you.

For the case you described, I think the easiest solution would be to
create a new environment for these ``special'' paragraphs. That would
take care of setting them off from the rest of the text, and could also
adjust the headers and footers (although that's a bit trickier).

I've searched extensively for some package / class that performs this,
but have not found anything, and would greatly appreciate some help.
Here's the problem:
 
I would like to be able to type a document where I can flag certain
paragraphs to be treated specially.  For example:
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
This paragraph is normal
 
\begin{special1}
  I would like this paragraph, when typeset, to appear with a "(P1)" at
the very beginning of the paragraph.  If this paragraph is broken across
pages, I would like the "(P1)" to appear as the first couple characters
on the second page where the paragraph is broken.  Also, on any page
that contains a portion of this paragraph, I would like the header and
footer to say "Paragraph Type 1".
\end{special1}
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
I'm not very familiar with programming with LaTeX.  I am currently
reading through The LaTeX Companion.  I do have significant programming
background, but the TeX/LaTeX syntax is not like anything I've ever seen
before.  I'm not even sure if something like this is possible.  
 
Do you know of anything out there that performs something similar to
what I'm looking for.  If not, is LaTeX at least capable of doing
something like this.  
 
Thank you so much for your help.

It would useful for you to provide more information, such as what  
packages you are using and the errors that are reported in your log.

There are many mirrors of CTAN. Have you tried a different one?

Well, I am making progress, at least it now compiles:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx,fancyhdr}
%\usepackage{pstricks}

\usepackage{pstcol, pst-text}

\begin{document}

%\definecolor{pink}{rgb}{1, .75, .8}
\begin{pspicture}(-3,-2.2)(3,2.2)
%\psset{linestyle=none}
\newcommand{\curly}[1]{{\fontfamily{pzc}%
 \fontsize{17}{17}\itshape#1}}

\pstextpath[c]{
  \psarcn(0,0){2}{180}{0}
  {\curly{The Unseen University}}
}

\end{pspicture}

\end{document}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This produces a semi circle fine, but the text stands alone and does
not sit on the arc.

In the documentation on CTAN it does explain that this can happen
with some drivers, but I do not know how to fix it.

Thanks a lot.

Dear TUG,

I figured out the problem as I emailed to you earlier. I simply failed  
to save my TeX document as a Cyrillic(Mac OS) document.  Once I did  
that, my text appeared beautifully in the .pdf file and the .tex file.

My next problem: when I re-opened .tex document, the cyrillic  
Ukrainian letters became a mess of unrecognizable symbols.  The  
document still typeset properly, now I just can't read what's in  
the .tex file!

Any ideas?

Thank you for taking the time to read my email.

Hi,

I've been struggling with a problem for a couple of days now, and I  
can't seem to figure it out.  I am trying to type a LaTeX document in  
MacTeX
using English and Ukrainian fonts (Mac OS Leopard), but the Ukrainian

I have tried:

%When typing Ukrainian here, Ukrainian letters look fine.

Josh:

You have asked a hard question, which is why no one is answering much.
In order to do what you want to do, you'll need to get into the \output
routines, which is a confusing and odd sort of place, since they are
called asynchronously from everything else.  The approach I've used in
the past is to take the latex \output routine (it's in latex.ltx) copy
it into your own package, and modify it carefully.

Here's a sketch of something that might help you:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\usepackage{testing}

\global\newbox\parflag
\global\newbox\parflagnext
\setbox\parflag=\hbox{}

\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhead[LE,LO]{\hbox to 0pt{\hspace{-19pt}%
\raisebox{-50pt}[0pt][0pt]{\unhcopy\parflagnext}}
\unhbox\parflagnext%
\global\setbox\parflagnext=\hbox{\unhbox\parflag}}
\fancyhead[RE,RO]{\thepage}

\newenvironment{special1}{\global\setbox\parflag=\hbox{\textbf{P1}}%
\global\setbox\parflagnext=\hbox{\unhcopy\parflag}%
\noindent\hspace{-\wd\parflag}\unhcopy\parflag\hspace{\parindent}}{}

You'll need to do some more work to get it right, but I think something
like this will work for you.

There's a box here called \parflag and a friend called \parflagnext.  I
think you can use the \output routines to load them appropriately with
the data you want, but I am going to leave you to come up with the
arrangement of flags to make it work.  The nonintuitive things you have
to watch out for are that the headers are applied to the page *last*,
and the paragraph in your special environment has all been typeset
before the page is broken.  (So you can't use the closing of the
environment to erase any of the boxes, because they'll be missing when
the page breaks.)

Hope this helps, and good luck,

 -tom

Subject: [texhax] getting to a page
Message-ID: <200804262104.m3QL4XeI019366@strawberry.ncifcrf.gov>

I often work at home while ssh linked into a computer at work.  At
work I edit my file with vim and in a separate Terminal/ssh link use
atchange to trigger latex typesetting (see
http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/atchange.html).  The atchange also
puts a copy of the final pdf on the web.  A program on my home
computer, aw, watches the web and grabs the pdf for display on my
screen.  (This is much faster than a remote xwindows display)  This
works quite nicely except that I would like the pdf to come up on the
page I'm working on in vim or at least to stay on the same page.  But
Adobe Reader insists on starting on the first page and I can't
identify any commands to control its start page.  Does anyone know how
to do that?

On the other end, I've succeeded in programming vim to create a file
that gives the line number I'm on when I write the file out.  It goes
in ~/.vim/plugin  This is the code if you are interested:

********************************************************************************

function CurrentLine()
" original
"  redir! > %.vimcurrentline
  redir! > .%.vimcurrentline
  echo line('.')
  redir END
:endfunction

********************************************************************************

Given the dot file created by this plugin, I know the current line I'm
on.

To locate that line on the output I considered three methods.

1. convert to ps with dvips, then to pdf with gs.  Back convert from
pdf to text with pdftotext.  For some resaon the result is an empty
file, though back converting pdf to text works with other pdfs.

2. convert to rtf with latex2rtf and then examine the text. 
Unfortunately the RTF doesn't have pages.

3. convert to html with latex2html and then examine the text. 
Unfortunately the html doesn't have pages.

So I've got part of the solution but I'm missing the critical part of
identifying which page of the typeset output I'm on.  If I knew which
page it was I could use gs:

echo "quit" | gs -q -r2000x2000 -sDEVICE=pswrite -sOutputFile=$name%02d.ps $name.p
s

to get all the pages and select just one page for transmission and
display.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

You can try accessing the remote pdf file with sshfs:

  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html

AFAIK, in Adobe Reader you'd have to close the file (Ctrl-W) and than
go back (Alt-left) in order to re-read the file.  Alternatively, you
can use a reader like xpdf which can re-read the file on the fly.

HTH,
Oleg

I think Oleg is right that Adobe Reader won't do this automatically, but
both xpdf and the kpdf (kde pdfviewer in linux) will.

kpdf is the easiest, as it does the watching for you and will reload a
pdf file that has changed automatically - and to the same page and
magnification. It also remembers this information from one kpdf session
to another.

xpdf can be run in server mode and triggered to reload when a process
completes. Locally this is done by:

start xpdf by using

xpdf -remote key file.pdf &

then compile your document using 

pdflatex file.tex && xpdf -remote key -reload

then xpdf automatic reloads (to the same page, location, magnification,
etc. -just like hitting an "r" key to xpdf which you might find nearly
as useful RTFM) whenever pdflatex is done. I would guess you could do
this as:

xpdf -remote key file.pdf &
aw ... && xpdf -remote key -reload

and then xpdf would reload your pdf whenever your aw process completed.

Does this help?

Steve

Nope, but I do know that Foxit reader (which too is free and is also faster
than Adobe Reader - I use it as my default pdf reader) reopens on the last

I have the following naive problem in trying to run miktex on
a new vista machine.

No where can I find either the texmf folder of localtexmf (maybe before I 
just copied texmf into localtexmf and then modified and added my special 
configurations.

What is the analogous procedure now?

So perhaps this would have been best addressed to the MiKTeX group.

Assuming you're using the latest version, as expressly mentioned in the info
on the new format, there is no localtexmf and the base tree is probably
C:\miktexmf2.7; the setup will have asked you what you preferred.

You can still create a localtexmf if you wish.

Thanks for the suggestion. I also had written to miktex and got a slighlty 
different answer - replacements for texmf and localtexmf are to be found
in users/administrator/roaming/ ....

I am having trouble finding the end of that chain. But the first part is 
there while there is no file c:\miktexmf

If you are interested the thread on the miktex site I originated has more 
info.

setup did not I think ask where to put such things.

Hello,

I am using the abbr bib style, but instead of something like this:

[1] J. Shorter. Hsp104 a weapon to combat diverse neurodegenerative
disorders. NeuroSignals, 16:63?74, 2008.

[2] S. Sipione and E. Cattaneo. Modeling Huntingtons disease in cells,

I would like to have something like this:

[1] J. Shorter. Hsp104 a weapon to combat diverse neurodegenerative
disorders. NeuroSignals, 16:63?74, 2008. [2] S. Sipione and E.

Cattaneo. Yeast genes that enhance toxicity of a mutant huntintin
fragment ir alphasynuclein. Science, 302:1769?1772, 2003.


Yes, all entries without separating line feeds. If you are wondering,
it is for a space-limited proposal.

I've looked at the bib environment, which is basically a specialized
list, and I could not find out how to alter the list environment to do
this sort of thing.

I'd appreciate any help on this.

thanks,

Glen

In a Linux system, you can do this as follows:

1. Have the line

       \immediate\write18{pwd > path.tex}\input{path}

    in your document, at the place where you want the name of the working
    directory.

2. Run latex with the command

       latex -shell-escape filename

    where filename is the name of your file.

And for Windows, first load the verbatim package in your preamble:

\usepackage{verbatim}

Then

This is a very nasty hack, but it does what you want.

Either

1) Just after the begin{thebibliography} line in your bbl file put

\makeatletter\def\item{\refstepcounter\@listctr\@itemlabel\space}\makeatothe
r

but you will need to redo it every time you run BibTeX, or

2) Edit abbrv.bst and call it something different (e.g., abbrvhacked.bst),
then just after the line

  "\begin{thebibliography}{"  longest.label  * "}" * write$ newline$

add

 
"\makeatletter\def\item{\refstepcounter\@listctr\@itemlabel\space}\makeatoth
er" write$ newline$

Then, of course, use \bibliographystyle{abbrvhacked} in your main LaTeX
file.  For this to be found by BibTeX, you will need to either refresh your
filename database, or save it in your current working directory.

Cheers,  Phil

Philip,

I just found that when I used the xspace package, it seems to nullify
the hack that you suggested. I can live without xspace (I think) but
just for future reference.

thanks,

That's a bit hard to believe since (to my knowledge) the xspace package only
defines new commands that could do nothing to interfere with the hack, dirty
as it might be.  In fact, I just tested it and get no change.

Sure you didn't do something else too?

Cheers,  Phil

Philip,

I just did some proper tests and I believe that you are right and it
is not xspace. It appears to be effected by hyperref. Yes, I have just
toggled it and it goes from one to the other due to hyperref.
