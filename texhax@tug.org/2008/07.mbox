Subject: [texhax] Inserting "rubber space" of enumerate label
Message-ID: <19af81400807010316s78a4bd95hb66e26b774b9b8c6@mail.gmail.com>

Normally in enumerate labels are right-aligned. However assume that
(with enumitem package) my label is

[label=Part  \Roman*.]

Since roman numbers (and in the lesser degree Arabic) have variable
length there is no left justification of Part.

Is it possible to insert a rubber space between Part and \Roman* so
that the result would be

Part    I. blah-blah
Part   II. blah-and-blah
Part  III. blah-and-blah-and-blah
Part IV. blah-and-blah

etc


Thank you very much in advance. Victor

\parbox{some length}{Part\hfill\Roman*}

Unfortunately does not work: \parbox, \makebox or \framebox returns an error:

Use of \\enumerate does not match its definition

\mbox, \hbox, \fbox are accepted


Also \labelwidth={128pt} (or any other value) does not have an observable effect

This helped a little better


\begin{enumerate}[label=\hbox to 2cm{Part~\hfill\Roman*}, 
leftmargin=*,align=left,widest=Part~XVII]
\item dsf
\item sdfsdf
\end{enumerate}

adjust widest to your own liking

Should not that last generate an error ? If \labelwidth is
a <dimen> or <skip> variable, it would expect a <dimen>
or <skip>, not a <general text>.

It neither generate an error nor work. The same without {} but

labelindent=-2cm (or whatever) works.

I was asked by a colleague about companies that use TeX/LaTeX for 
documents, publications, whatever, either just in-house or for the 
public. I can't imagine how such information could be gotten, but I seem 
to recall some such list was prepared at some time in the recent past.

Does this ring a bell with anyone?

Really, any company that needs to manipulate .pdfs or create them  
should consider using pdftex or xetex (or the up-coming luatex).

I regularly use it to create printouts of art programs or lists of  
graphic files or to otherwise batch process .pdfs (Adobe Acrobat's  
capabilities for this are a bit limited).

Similarly I've used it to develop typesetting backends for a telephone  
book line ad generation system as well as one for personalized  
children's books --- it's a lot less expensive than licensing InDesign  
Server and in many ways more capable.

It's used even more by previous employer. Nifty on-line demo here:

We (Bibles.org.uk) are not a company, but all our Bibles and other books 
are typeset using either pdfLaTeX or XeLaTeX, see here:

   http://www.bibles.org.uk

In particular, our most recent publication, the critical edition of 
Classical Armenian Bible in 3 volumes (jointly with the Bible Society of 
Armenia) was typeset using XeLaTeX. The Russian and Bulgarian Bibles were 
also typeset with XeLaTeX, the rest with pdfLaTeX. The pdf of our Russian 
Bible is freely downloadable:

http://www.bibles.org.uk/pdf/bibles/Russian/rsb.pdf

(for several others the pdf is also freely downloadable and ALL of them 
are royalty-free)

I am using beamer to generate slides for a presentation I am doing next 
week.  I would also like to have a handout, and I have looked at the 
pdfpages package.  The problem with that one is that it copies all the 
slides, including all the overlays for each slide.  Is there some way of 
excluding all but one of the overlays automatically?

I don't see how beamer or latex can know WHICH overlay to include
automatically. Beamer has a handout option:

\documentclass[handout]{beamer}

which helps. This generates only 1 page for each frame. Then your
overlay specifications need to include handout directives, e.g.;

\onslide<1| handout:0>\includegraphics{fig}

will omit fig. In practice you simply need to add "| handout:0" to all
the overlay specifications you want to be left off the frame in the
handout version. [Warning: the space after the | is mandatory, for
reasons that I don't pretend to understand]. While this might seem
tedious, for a single presention it will probably only take a few
minutes to paste this into your presentation.

Then there are a variety of ways to turn this into an n-up handout. I
tend to use pdflatex to generate the handout pages as a pdf, and then
use pdfnup to put multiple pages on a page. This is just a front end
script that uses pdfpages to do the work.

Most if not all this is well-documented in the beamer userguide.

Is this what you were after?

Subject: [texhax] Punctuation around inline diagrams
Message-ID: <20080704155403.529b8052.padawan12@obiwannabe.co.uk>


Dear list,

I have a problem that needs a little careful explanation as follows.

Within my text I use diagrams as if they were words. Each diagram is a
small iconic box corresponding to a software object. I will refer to them
here as {object}.

Where an {object} is followed by a comma or period and is typeset so that
it appears at the end of a line, the punctuation often appears at the start
of the next line. Example:
 
----
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur....so using this method the {object},
which contains the code, will be created automatically. Ut enim ad minim 
veniam, quis nostrud exercitation....

will be typeset as 
 
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur....so using this method the {object}
, which contains the code, will be created automatically. Ut enim ad minim 
veniam, quis nostrud exercitation....

-----

I would like to bind any comma, semicolon or period more tightly to the {object}
or increase the penalty for starting a line with punctuation.

Thankyou for any suggestions.

Andy Farnell

Try pgfpages in combination with the handout-mode in stead.

how is {object} created? minimal example? It would appear that there are

The code for the image include is;

% Graphics include for inline objects
\newcommand{\pdobj}[1]{%
\raisebox{-1pt}{\enspace\includegraphics[angle=0, scale=0.6]%
{./images/objects/#1.ps}}}

Elsewhere I use it as;

Finally we'll use differentiation with \pdobj{object-sd-fexpr} 
and \pdobj{object-sd-clip} to get changes that are positive. 
Modulating the sine wave by the output of \pdobj{object-sd-tm} 

The initial space seemed necessary to stop the objects being
too close to the preceding text. I should mention that the
objects are not fixed width, some are considerably wider than
others.

Thankyou.

Dear TUG,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to turn to. Appologies if it
is not. I'm a new mactex user from sweden who is having problems with
getting documents to display the swedish charactera ? ? and ?.

I've tried

\usepackage[swedish]{babel}
\usepackage[encoding]{inputenc}

but this generated the error message:

file 'encoding.def' not found

i don't know where to find the file or once found where to put it (i'm
also a novice mac user)

I've also tried (which was recomended somewhere else)

\usepackage[swedish]{babel}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

but this generated the error message

!Package inputeenc Error: Keyboard character used is undefined
(inputenc)          in inputencoding 'latin1'.

I'd be very grateful if you could help me with this or direct me to
someone who can.

all the best,
Martin J?nsson

Yes, that was wrong, latin1, latin9, utf8... are right encodings.

I would use

\usepackage[swedish]{babel}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

Now ---you might be using TeXShop as your editor, I guess; so, you  
have to be sure TeXShop is using the same encoding you're telling  
LaTeX to use: go to TeXShop -> Preferences ->Document tab -> Encoding  
(lower right corner) and select in the pull-down menu the encoding  
you plan to use. I've suggested above utf8, so it would be ``Unicode  
(UTF-8)'', but if you prefer latin1, select ``Western (ISO Latin 1)''.

Restart TeXShop and try again.

There is also a TeX on Mac OS X mailing list:

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

if you want to join.

Best,

Axel

No, not as a substitute of \raisebox in your macro, but in your text:  
whatever you put inside a \mbox will not break across lines.

Hi Axel, 

I understand. Thanks for the suggestion, in this case the problem is 
the comma or period that follows an inline object, which is not part
of the object. So I think I need another solution.

Thanks,

Andy

But can't you put inside a \mbox your object and the punctuation? Like

...<text> \mbox{\macroforobject,} <more text> or

...<text> \mbox{{\macroforobject},} <more text>

Axel

I haven't tried to reproduce your problem, but have you tried adding
\nolinebreak to the end of the definition of \pdobj? That might
prevent lines from breaking even when you want them to, though (i.e.
when you don't have punctuation immediately after). To fix that, you
might need to explicitly allow a line break again, or something. Or
maybe you could just explicitly add \nolinebreak when you do have
punctuation there, and leave \pdobj as it is for cases when you don't
want punctuation.

Sorry Axel, I put that rather badly. What I mean is, I'm after
a general solution. It's at that stage (40+ chapters, 600 pages)
where I can't (reasonably) go through looking for every instance
of an object being too close to a line end. And if I make any edits
it may change.

I guess what I want to say in TeX is:

IF we just processed an object image AND the next char is a [comma,
period, colon or semicolon] AND it's at the end of a line

THEN temporarily make the penalty for putting the [comma,
period, colon or semicolon] on a new line very high.


Is that sort of thing possible to specify as a rule with document 
wide scope?

Cheers,

Andy

I don't have anything to add for a solution to this, but I think you
won't be able to code what you say as a TeX macro.  On the other hand, I
think all you want to do is to forbid space between your objects and any
punctuation marks that follow, which I think sounds more like a TeX-able
task, though really the way you do that is only by making sure that
there aren't any spaces hiding in your definition.

I don't know why this is happening, and wonder if there isn't a spurious
space in the \includegraphics definition that most of us don't notice
because we don't use ps files inline.  You might try just sticking the
whole definition in a box to contain any spurious spaces it might have
lurking in it.

At any rate, a working example that shows the problem is probably
essential to anyone giving you real help.  I, at least, can't reproduce
it from your description.

I can't think of anything, but I'm not a LaTeX guru at all. Let's  
hope someone has a solution, if there is one...

  \usepackage{xspace}

and the definition may be modified to read:

\newcommand{\pdobj}[1]{\space%
\raisebox{-1pt}{\includegraphics[angle=0, scale=0.6]%
{./images/objects/#1.ps}}\xspace}

\xspace will check for next character and if it is a punctuation, will
not insert a space, otherwise a space will be inserted.

Do we need an \enspace inside the box? Will it not inhibit breaking?
Guess, \space at the beginning will be the best option.

Happy TeXing and best regards

Perfect! Thankyou Nina. It also makes a general subtle improvement
to the spacing around all object boxes.

Thanks for the other suggestions Axel & all, the \mbox trick
may come in handy for other cases.

Yes, in single cases, but it's solutions like Nina's that always

There is no break-point in that definition, so if you get
breaks in "\pdobj{xxx}," then what you have is different from
what you tell.  My guesses:

1) Your actual definition contains a trailing space
2) You type a space between, like "\pdobj{object} ,"
3) You use some package that inserts spaces before all commas

Subject: [texhax] Automatically preventing line breaks before citations
Message-ID: <2A9E1730-8A4A-4CBC-94A2-4BADCC2FAC6E@vocaro.com>

Hi,

To prevent a line break before a citation command, I can manually add  
a non-breaking space:

lorem~\cite{smith}

But I want to make this automatic. In other words, I want to leave out  
the tilde and still get the same output.

After hacking around, I discovered that I can make a copy of cite.sty,  
include the copy in my document as a package, and change its spacing  
adjustment command (line 168) so that "highpenalty" is replaced with  
"10000". This has the desired effect of preventing line breaks in  
front of \cite commands.

The only problem is that now I have to bundle a custom copy of  
cite.sty with all my documents. There must be some way of simplifying  
my solution, but all my attempts have failed. Ideally, I want to  
reduce my solution to a single command that I add to the top of my  
document. Any suggestions? Thanks,

Trevor

I don't know how to work the TeX engineering side of this, but you could
try social engineering instead.  Fix your new package so that your
change is an option to cite.sty and submit it as an improvement to that
package.  If it's backward-compatible, I don't see why it shouldn't be
considered.

Leonardo,

Are you using the hyperref or citeref packages?

If you are using hyperref, check that the pagebackref option is not being
used. This includes the page numbers in the reference list/bibliography.

citeref does the same thing.

That's a good idea. It won't be necessary, however, because upon  
further investigation, I discovered that the functionality I require  
already exists!

Apparently I was confused about how the cite.sty package works. I was  
thinking that cite.sty is the actual citation code in TeX, when in  
fact it's just an extension of TeX's built-in citation mechanism. That  
is, I assumed cite.sty was somehow included implicitly in every TeX  
document, but I realize now it's just another add-on package.

To make a long story short, what I said before about highpenalty vs.  
10000 is incorrect. The highpenalty value that cite.sty provides by  
default is enough to prevent line breaks. So all I have to do is this:

\usepackage{cite}

Hmm... looks like my statement above is also incorrect, at least  
partially. It turns out that the \@highpenalty value used by cite.sty  
(usually defined as 301) is enough to prevent *most* citation line  
breaks but not *all* of them. For example, I have a document with  
about 150 citations, of which 13 have a line break between the  
citation and the text that precedes it. Using cite.sty prevents the  
line breaks in only 7 of these 13. If, however, I change cite.sty to  
use a penalty of 10000 instead of \@highpenalty, all 13 line breaks  
are fixed.

I think the best solution, then, is to change the cite.sty package to  
use 10000 for the penalty. (It doesn't make sense to prevent line  
breaks only some of the time.) I sent an email to the author of  
cite.sty to discuss this change, but it bounced back to me saying  
"name or service not known". I used the email address listed in  
cite.sty's README:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/

What do I do now?

Bear with me before deciding that this is hopelessly off-topic. 

I believe, and certainly hope that there is a strong future for 
conversion of Open Office ODT format into TeX input source.  Alas, it is 
not easy, and I am struggling with my first attempts.  OpenOffice ODT is 
simply a zipped file of XML files and some other things, and it unzips 
easily, producing the needed files styles.xml and content.xml, which are 
then subject to transformation, using XSLT. 

I have an extremely crude, partially functional, operation that has 
already saved me on several occasions.  I take the increasingly strange 
Word documents I am sent and run them through OpenOffice2, so as to 
escape the hopelessly flaky RTF translations altogether. 

Is anyone else who reads TeXhax doing the same thing?  It has  to be 
open-ended and to produce Vanilla TeX, as well as other things like 
LaTeX.  The last thing we should be trying to do is imitate 
word-processor formatting.  (I receive MSWord documents that look like 
generic graduate-school papers, double-spaced for the copy-editor, and 
with all sorts of horrors such as notes with explicit note number 
references that have to be eliminated. The journals I set look nothing 
like that.)

OpenOffice stylesheets are not simple.  You do not get anything obvious 
like <italic>. . .</italic> setting off type styles.  ("Italic" is 
buried as an attribute of a child node of a font declaration node.)  But 
ODT is reliable and stable, and XSLT ought to be able to do everything 
we need. 

If anyone knows of an open forum such as TeXhax, where someone like 
myself could ask naive questions about XSL stylesheets, that would help 
too. 

My usual approach is:
xsltproc  -o minio_tr.tex  minio_tr.xsl styles.xml content.xml
and I have updated libxml and libxslt today.

I am ready (although with some embarassment) to send anyone who wants 
them, my working xsl files.

Message-ID: <a10948b50807070755j4480e136r951f55c0aa3622f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was wondering what's the best way to locate the source of a
macro/command (ie which file the definition resides in).

The only way I know at the moment is simply go through the loaded
style files, first the personal and then the default /texmf
directories, which can become a big hassle. Also, this method would
fail to uniquely identify the definition that is actually used, if
there are multiple occurrences of the same-named macro across
different files...

So I feel there must be a better way. I use \show to show the
'content' of a macro, but it doesn't tell you where it comes from...

Advice would be appreciated.

Yo

OpenOffice.org already has a Latex converter built-in. Certainly in
2.4.0, possibly earlier. In Writer, it's available under File->Export.

I cannot comment on the quality, I've never actually tried it. I guess
it would be similar to that of other existing X to Latex converters.

That is a sort of good news, but most of these converters strive very 
hard to retain the formatting of the ODT document, which is not, in this 
instance, what is needed. 

(I am currently downloading OOo 2.4.1 to see what I can learn from it.)

As for the other XML -> LaTeX filters, the chief problem I am having is 
to read the ODT stylesheet effectively.  The output to TeX is easy, once the
various attributes are found and selected.

Subject: [texhax] Pdflatex and includegraphics.
Message-ID: <22FDEC5B-BBB1-4AA7-9BA3-5D4EE7EC87C5@auckland.ac.nz>


I was experiencing some funnies (which I won't go into) when using
includegraphics with *.eps files.  In desperation I decided to try
using pdflatex and *.pdf files for the graphics.

This did in fact get rid of the funnies problem.  But I found that
when using pdflatex, includegraphics baulked at file names of the
form ``melvin.clyde.irving.pdf'', although with vanilla latex it
did not mind graphics files called ``melvin.clyde.irving.eps''.

I worked around the problem by changing names to the form
``melvin-clyde-irving.pdf'', and all was well.

I'd just like to get some clarification as to why the combination
of pdflatex and includegraphics objects to file names with multiple
dots in them.  Are there flags or arguments that can be set to make
pdflatex/includegraphics accept such names?  Is there a good reason
to eschew such names?  Or might this be considered a bug[let]?

Thanks for any enlightenment.

	cheers,

Probably because the pdftex-driver for LaTeX is different than the
default dvips-driver.

The in-built converter that OpenOffice uses is Writer2LaTeX.
You get also get it standalone at:
	http://www.hj-gym.dk/~hj/writer2latex/
which is what we did.  It will probably be a more recent version, and
you can run it standalone and incorporate it into scripts -- always a
Good Thing.

Overall, we found Writer2LaTeX wonderful.

Writer2LaTeX is customizable, so you can specify a lot of information
about how the content is to be converted.  There are several
"standard" configs you can use, ranging from "as faithful as possible"
to "semantic only" conversions.

There was a lot of rubbish in the ODT doc that we didn't want, and
quick configuration of Writer2LaTeX (below, based on the "ultraclean"
standard config) removed most of it, so that what was left could be
quickly cleaned up with scripts and a few Emacs keystrokes.

	Niall

Hi -

I am currently creating a slideshow with a beamer document class and the
package "beamerthemesplit". I wish to call upon a graph (saved as a

	\label{fig:arc length}
\end{figure}

I tried putting \usepackage{pgf} and then \usepackage{epsfig} and then
both together in the preamble, but had no luck with generating the graph.

Can you please help me?

Thanks! Ferebee Tunno

What you need is the graphicx package (at least in your example  
you're not using pgf/TikZ code); like this (typesetting via latex ->  
dvips -> PS to PDF):

\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{beamerthemesplit}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Arc length picture}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[height=3in,width=3in]{<your-figure>.ps}
	\label{fig:arc length}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}
\end{document}

Now ---if you first convert your ps image to pdf, with

epstopdf <your-figure>.ps

in a terminal (in Linux or Mac OS, but I guess with Windows you can  
do it in the Command Prompt) you can use pdfLaTeX then, and simply  
call your graphic as

\includegraphics[height=3in,width=3in]{<your-figure>}

without the extension.

There is a very helpful Beamer User mailing list:

https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/latex-beamer-users

Best,

Axel

I have had the same problem these days, with own packages
I made in the previous millenium.

What just came to my mind:

1. use \listfiles in your document `job.tex' (say)
2. convert the list of files in job.log as follows:
     turn a line containing package `foo' into
         \afterpackage{foo}{\show\foo}
3. change job.tex as follows:
     right after \documentclass, insert
         \usepackage{afterpackage}
         and then the \afterpackage list as above.
4. after the next run of job.tex, look in job.log
where the result of \show\foo changes.

[sorry, not tested]

This confines the search to packages that you are
actually using. For the "conversion", you may have
a smart editor or be able to use Perl or AWK
(I am developping docstrip-like macros for purposes
like this one, some already working).

Difficulties coming to my mind:
* what about .def files? and some of these have been
loaded by initex already.
* If you use memoir.cls, the definition may be there.

HTH -- Uwe.

What I'm trying to do is simple conceptually, I've got a LaTeX
template for final examinations and I want to put space on the
exam paper for the students to answer. I may not be doing this 
the best way presently, and I'm sure I'll hear if there's a better
way to do it. But what I'd also like to do (and I had a look at
_The_LaTeX_Companion_ and didn't find any suggestions) is
to be able to have the code for a vertical space and a horizontal
line and put it in a block with a multiplier to get n lines for some 
value of n. Given that TeX and LaTeX behave like a programming
language, I would have thought this was possible.

The relevant lines from the template follow:

\newcommand{\IncludeWritingSpace}{true}
\newcommand{\ansSpace}[1]{\ifthenelse{\equal{\IncludeWritingSpace}{true}} {\\{\bf Write answer here:} #1}{}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item This is an exam question

\answer{ there is a similar block of code to the ansSpace command that allows the answer to be printed 
               optionally -- for marking guides and for students to review their answers versus the required answers}
% what I would like is to be able to put a multiplier on the combined vspace
% and rule lines to get 2 or more lines for students to write on.
\ansSpace{
\vspace{14pt}\\
\rule[0pt]{14cm}{0.75pt}\\

\usepackage{forloop}

And here is a "plain TeX" way 
(no, it's LaTeX, and LaTeX's \loop improves the plain TeX \loop) 
to explain the concept:

\newcounter{ahead}
\newcommand*{\answerlines}[1]{%
  \loop 
    \ifnum\value{ahead}>0\relax % sorry, I don't know ifthenelse
    \addtocounter{ahead}{-1}%
    \vspace{14pt}\rule[0pt]{14cm}{.75}\\%
  \repeat
  \ignorespaces} %% needed?

So 
    \answerlines{15}

should produce 15 lines for answering. 

Isn't \rule[0pt] the same as \rule!?

Subject: [texhax] Uncovering table ENTRIES with beamer
Message-ID: <48778CDB.30700@math.mun.ca>

Dear Friends,
The beamer user guide gives clear ways to uncover a table row-wise or
column-wise.  Has anyone found a way to uncover entries?

Suppose, for instance, you want to show the entries of a table above
the main diagonal, and then those below.  Any ideas?

Thanks for any advice, Edgar

What is the best way to organize table of contents in the following
form(example):

Charles Dickens
       Tale of Two Cities
        Oliver Twist
        etc.
        etc.
William Shakespeare
         Othello

         etc.
         etc.
Writer One
         work 1
         work2
.
.

I am hoping that there is a better way to achieve the above than:
\chapter{Charles Dickens}
\section{Tale of Two Cities}
body of the text . . . .
\section{Oliver Twist}
body of the text . . . .

\chapter{William Shakespeare}
\section{Othello}

Texhaxers:

I'm using

\usepackage{hyperref}

Someone in my lab pointed out that all the links to figures in the pdf
point to the figure caption such that after one follows the link the
caption is at the top of the page view, not the figure itself.  The
figure is not visible and the reader has to scroll up to see it.

The label has to follow the caption or the figure number gets lost in
the calling text so I can't just move the label up.  So how can I get
hyperref to "do the right thing" and point to the top of the figure
environment?  Alternatively, can it be made to just point to the
relevant page?  I didn't see options for this at

http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html

I'm using:

hyperref.sty    2003/11/30 v6.74m Hypertext links for LaTeX

I'm in the middle of trying to typeset Dostoevsky's The Brothers
Karamazov, which requires something similar: The novel contains four
parts and an epilogue; each part contains three books; and each book
contains a number of chapters (as does the epilogue). (To further
complicate things, the books are numbered 1--12, but the chapter
numbers start at 1 again for each book.)

It's been a while since I organized the table of contents, but it
looks like I've done this:

%%%%%
\makeatletter
\providecommand*{\toclevel at mypart}{0}
\providecommand*{\toclevel at book}{1}
\providecommand*{\toclevel at mychapter}{2}
\makeatother

\usepackage[pagestyles]{titlesec}
\usepackage{titletoc}

\titleclass{\mypart}{page}[\part]
\newcounter{mypart}
\renewcommand{\themypart}{\Roman{mypart}}
\titleformat{\mypart}{\Huge\scshape\filcenter}{}{0pt}{}
\titlespacing{\mypart}{0pt}{9pc}{0pt}

\titleclass{\book}{page}[\mypart]
\newcounter{book}
\renewcommand{\thebook}{\Roman{book}}
\titleformat{\book}[display]{\bfseries\LARGE\filcenter}{Book
\thebook}{24pt}{\huge}
\titlespacing{\book}{0pt}{6pc}{0pt}

\titleclass{\mychapter}{straight}[\book]
\newcounter{mychapter}[book]
\renewcommand{\themychapter}{\arabic{mychapter}}
\titleformat{\mychapter}[display]{\filleft\bfseries\Large}{Chapter
\themychapter}{1ex}{\LARGE}
\titlespacing{\mychapter}{0pt}{24pt}{12pt}

\setmarks{book}{mychapter}
\newpagestyle{main}{
  \headrule
  \sethead[\thepage][][\small\bfseries\sffamily The Brothers
Karamazov: \booktitle]
          {\small\bfseries\sffamily\mychaptertitle}{}{\thepage}}

\titlecontents{mypart}[0pt]{\addvspace{1pc}\scshape\Large}{}{}{}
\titlecontents{book}[1pc]{\addvspace{0.5pc}\bfseries\large}{Book
\thecontentslabel: }{}{}
\titlecontents{mychapter}[4pc]{}{\contentslabel{2em}}{}{\titlerule*[1pc]{.}\contentspage}
%%%%%

I seem to remember that the documentation for titilesec and titletoc
helped me a lot, so it's worth a look.

You might like to try pgf resp. tikz [1,2]. It integrates perfect in LaTeX and 
allows to "program" pictures. A box with lines would be easily to create 
within a few lines of code.
Furthermore, I guess you will quickly like it to create pictures for exams and 
course material in addition.
The benefits are easily modifying of pictures within the LaTeX-File, a clear 
uniform look of text an pictures, no compression artefacts of pictures and 
small file size.

However, it has a similar learning curve to LaTeX.  

For your initial problem. Tikz provide loop-structures as well as mathematical 
calculation in a (imho) "more easy way" compared to TeX. I would suggest to 
create a new command which takes the height of the desired box as the 
parameter.

Just my two cents...

Torsten

CC. If you require some help with tikz code please contact me I will try to 
give some "start-up".

Update.
Then consider using hypcap and/or caption.

you might want to have a look at the memoir class it has both \part and 
\book that you might want to use for this, the authors should then be a 
\part or a \book, and so forth. And memoir is fully ajustable

Call for participation: Towards Digital Mathematics Library (DML 2008)
July 27th, 2008, Birmingham, UK c/o MKM 2008

Workshop webpage: http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/dml-2008.xhtml

Travel: http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/travel.php
Accomodation: http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/accommodation.php

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects, 
asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow [CEDRAM model])?

 The picture comes along with name where it had been stored.

For e.g if I have saved a picture in My documents and named it as Cat..
 It comes as

So how do i elude from this.Please help me.

I shall be glad in case i receive your reply.

Dear all,

I'm new to the list, and even though I searched the archives and
didn't find anything, this question may already have been asked.

For a fairly large project I need to produce both HTML and
PostScript/PDF output. After much experimenting I finally decided to
go with tex4ht for the LaTeX to HTML transformation. The problem I
have is that I'm using Adobe Garamond and Adobe Frutiger as fonts and,
with Garamond in particular, this creates issues with the translation
(the ligatures don't get translated correctly). Watching the debug
from tex4ht I can see it complains about not finding the .htf
equivalents for these fonts. Unfortunately I can't seem to find
information about what .htf is and how/if I can transform the font
metrics files I have of Garamond and Frutiger.

The other, probably simpler option would be to have some kind of
conditional inclusion of the two Adobe fonts - or rather conditional
exclusion of the font directive. Something like (pseudo code):

\iftex4ht
\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{pad}
\else
\fi

Though, this too will soon get quite complex. I define many style
commands that I use that include these fonts. Any hints or suggestions
would be most welcome.

After I sent off my message I started experimenting with exactly this.
Though I think I could manage creating the .htf files, it would simply
 take too long and be terribly tedious (there are six missing fonts,
codes 0-255): Many lines to hand write...

This is the part I didn't know how to do. This is great and exactly
what I needed. I use GNU make for all my TeX documents so this will be
easy to implement.

Since you seem to know one or two things about tex4ht are all the
configuration file options documented anywhere? In the documentation
on my system (FC8, tetex-tex4ht 1.0.2008_02_28_2058-3) it says

"The following are some of the more useful underlying commands of TeX4ht."

Though many of the commands are self explanatory, others are not.

Thank you again for your detailed and most helpful answer.

You need to load garamond and frutiger only when you create pdf.
Loading these for html doesn't make much sense.  The makefile +
variable.tex combination can selectively load packages as you have
seen.

Open your text editor, cut and paste the above and save it as
makefile.  That is all.  Once you have done this, please issue the
command 'make html' from the prompt.

You may take a look at:

  http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/docs/ptex-04/ptex04.html

Another way to extract more information is to add 'info' option to
your command to generate html:

 htlatex <your filename> "html,info"

Take a look at the log file, you will have enough information to
configure TeX4ht.  Hope this would help you.

Ahh, I misread your first comment and you misread my reply... I

You have

or

\usepackage[draft]{graphicx}

in your preamble.

Try loading the graphicx package with

\usepackage[final]{graphicx}

That is the right way of making HTML from TeX sources. TeX4ht is a
highly configurable system than any other for this purpose.

.htf stands for hypertext font.  It is an ascii font table file in
which character codes are provided for a given font in ascending
order.  Each line of a htf file will have one character.  If you open
cmr.htf, you can easily understand what I meant. Eiten Gurari has
devised a poetic character substitution system with these *.htf files
while post-processing the *.dvi output with t4ht program which is also
part of TeX4ht bundle.

Although it is not difficult to create .htf fonts for garamond or
frutiger, it will be a non-trivial task for a newbie.

Your problem can be solved by removing the font loading commands from
your document.  You may use the default cmr fonts during translation
to HTML.  After all, html can easily be controlled by a .css and using
garamond in the LaTeX sources do not provide any particular advantage
except problems as above.

If you are familiar with  gnu tools like make, makefile, things can
easily be done.  If you are in windows you can seek the help of
cygwin.  The procedure goes like this.

1. create a file namely, variable.tex, contents of which will look
like (or adjust as you might want):

-------------------- variable.tex --------------------------
\makeatletter
\@ifundefined{Status}{\gdef\Status{0}}{}
\makeatletter
\ifcase\Status %{0}
  \typeout{HTML output}
  \documentclass[<options>]{article} % or whatever
  %%% add any other packages or commands relevant to
  %%% html generation
%
 \or % Status = 1
   \typeout{PDF output}
   \documentclass[<options]{article}
   \usepackage{garamond}
   \usepackage{frutiger}
  %%% add any other packages or commands relevant to
  %%% PDF generation
\fi

------------------- End of variable.tex -------------------------

2. Your source document will not have the preamble part, instead it will have:

 \input variable.tex
 \begin[document}

3. Create makefile in the following fashion:

-------------------- makefile ---------------------

FILE=<your filename>
## do not use any extension, just provide the basefile name


html:
        htlatex $(FILE)

pdf:
        pdflatex '\def\Status{1}\input $(FILE)'

------------------ end of makefile ----------------


Now happily execute the following commands at the prompt:

for html:

    make html

for PDF

    make pdf

Hope this helps, if you have any doubts or problems, please get back to me.

Happy TeXing and best regards

.htf stands for hypertext font.  It is an ascii font table file in
which character codes are provided for a given font in ascending
order.  Each line of a htf file will have one character.  If you open
cmr.htf, you can easily understand what I meant. Eiten Gurari has

cygwin.  The procedure goes like this.

1. create a file namely, variable.tex, contents of which will look
like (or adjust as you might want):

-------------------- variable.tex --------------------------
\makeatletter
\@ifundefined{Status}{\gdef\Status{0}}{}
\makeatletter
\ifcase\Status %{0}
 \typeout{HTML output}
 \documentclass[<options>]{article} % or whatever
 %%% add any other packages or commands relevant to
 %%% html generation
%
 \or % Status = 1
  \typeout{PDF output}
  \documentclass[<options]{article}
  \usepackage{garamond}
  \usepackage{frutiger}
 %%% add any other packages or commands relevant to
 %%% PDF generation
\fi

------------------- End of variable.tex -------------------------

2. Your source document will not have the preamble part, instead it will have:

 \input variable.tex
 \begin[document}

3. Create makefile in the following fashion:

-------------------- makefile ---------------------

FILE=<your filename>
## do not use any extension, just provide the basefile name


html:
       htlatex $(FILE)

pdf:
       pdflatex '\def\Status{1}\input $(FILE)'

------------------ end of makefile ----------------


Now happily execute the following commands at the prompt:

for html:

   make html

for PDF

   make pdf

Hope this helps, if you have any doubts or problems, please get back to me.

Happy TeXing and best regards

Subject: [texhax] mathpazo font question: how to fix "\sl" when
	using	package[sc]{mathpazo}
Message-ID: <20080714110744.GA19840@mrao.cam.ac.uk>

Dear texhax,

I tried using
\usepackage[sc]{mathpazo}      (which invokes the pplx font family)
instead of
\usepackage{mathpazo}          (which invokes ppl font)
and I found that it sets the text better, with nicer spacing. Nice!

However, the downside of using pplx is that it doesn't provide any "sl"
fonts, so {\sl slant} comes out identical to {\em em}.
(Example latex file appended below.)

Please could a latex2e wizard advise me 
what magic one-liner to add to my document style
so that when I say "{\sl ...}", the ppl font's "sl" is used?
Replies direct to mackay at mrao.cam.ac.uk much appreciated.  

Thanks very much,
 
David MacKay

Who told you to use \em and \sl?  Look for a file 

   .../.../texmf*/doc/latex/base/fntguide.pdf

on your system.  It explains the LaTeX2e font selection scheme.

BTW, the interline space is determined at the end of the paragraph but
\large is invisible when the paragraph is formatted.  Put \par into
the group:

{\large Some text.\par} instead of {\large Some text.}\par

  Reinhard

Hi Nina,
mails sent to a list server are delivered sequentially to all list
members.  This takes some time.  I received your original message
before the forwarded one.  Don't know in which order mails are
delivered but most likely in the same order members subscribed to the
list.

Apparently the server was still busy delivering your first mail when
you forwarded it again.  There is nothing wrong with the server, it's
how things work.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <20080714165717.GA29263@mrao.cam.ac.uk>

Dear texhax,

I received one suggestion that seems to work, which 
is a modification of the font file, 
rather than a modification of the document style.

Here is the modification, expressed as  a diff.

diff /usr/share/texmf-tetex/tex/latex/psnfss/ot1pplx.fd  /usr/share/texmf-tetex/tex/latex/psnfss/ot1pplx.fd.bak
17,20d16

<    <-> pplro8t
< }{}
< 
29c25
< % \DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pplx}{m}{sl}{<->ssub * pplx/m/it}{}
---
> \DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pplx}{m}{sl}{<->ssub * pplx/m/it}{}

I would be happy to hear other suggestions of how to fix 
the problem, but for the moment this is looking good.

thanks
	David

Subject: [texhax] Peculiar behavior of latex \section
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0807141750500.16108@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

The following short file illustrates the behavior:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
{\section{Section one}}
First section
\section{Section two}
Second section
\section{Section three}
Third section
\end{document}

When you run it, two things happen.  The "First section" is indented.  I 
understand, more or less, why this happens.  But there is only a small 
space between "First section" and "Section two", which is certainly 
anomalous.  Compare with the space between "Second section" and "Section 
three".  Things are normal if you remove the extra outer braces around 
"\section{Section one}, but the strange thing is that affects the spacing 
above the NEXT \section.  Incidentally the problem also disappears if you 
change the third and fourth lines to:

{\section{Section one}
F}irst section

It seems likely to me that some parameter that has to be reset at the end 
of the sectioning macros is not getting reset properly.  But I don't 
understand the operation of the \@startsection macro well enough to deal 
with this.

To tell the truth, I am not sure.  It was done by an author of a paper for 
the online journal I am tex editor for.  He complained that our cls file 
was defective in this regard.  I quickly discovered that article.cls (from 
which most of our style is copied) is just as bad.  He now claims that 
amsart fixes it.  Maybe I should look at that.  In any case, he has now 
worked around it, but I thought I might raise the question anyway.  I 
suspect that anything that puts tex in horizontal mode before the secnd 
brace would fix it.

Now that I recall it had something to do with avoiding a bad pagebreak.

The situation that the glitch showed up in was a file where I wanted
to keep something on the same page with a following start-of-section,
and so did

{\samepage
...
\section{title}\label{stuff}}

I couldn't understand why the section _after_ that one misbehaved, but
finally boiled it down to having { ... \section{title}...}; the
"\samepage" being irrelevant to the glitch.  I reported it to Mike Barr
because it happened with the style class of a journal he edits.  He
observed that it also happened with article.cls, and passed it on to
texhax.

You aren't allowed to put sectioning in groups.  I think

Hello, I read all FAQ and the Documentation, but appear to be lost at a
basic error at installation.

After downloading texlive2007-live-20070212.iso.zip, extracting the zip, and
extracting the iso (with isobuster), I tried to install the package on my
win xp pro notebook by executing C:\...\Desktop\Tex
Source\TeXLive2007\setuptl\tlpmgui.exe and immediately and repeatedly
received the following error msg

Error in startup script

wrong # args: should be "set varName ?newValue?"
   while executing
"source $filegui"
 (file "C:/Dokumente und Einstellungen/Axel Schneider Admin/Desktop/Tex
Source/TeXLive2007/setuptl/tlpmgui.exe/main.tcl" line 363)

I very much hope that you can help, as I need Tex desperately.

This is not the help you want, but let me tell you that on Windows I  
couldn't install TeXLive either (on Linux and Mac I had no problems  
at all). MikTeX, on the other hand, installed smoothly. Hope someone  
can help you with TL, but MikTeX is always an option (and very up to  
date).

You could also try TeX Live 2008

  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/tldev/install-tl.zip

It's not released yet, but it allows network installations and
incremental updates.

Message-ID: <b10d9630807172035w371575d8s4279e31006f1fd29@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm wondering if someone can help me debug a problem, or just comiserate.

I have an eps figure, possibly converted from ps, which I cannot clip when
inserting into a tex document processed by latex.  I can modify the original
eps file to change the bounding box to my liking and it looks fine in gv.
But, when the figure is inserted via \includegraphics[clip=true]{myfig.eps}
the resulting ps document (also viewed with gv!) shows the entire thing.
However, I can see that the bounding box is there. For instance, if I
scrutinize the figure alignment. Also if I look at the dvi with xdvi I can
use its option to show the bounding box, and it looks right.  However, for
some reason the output of latex (both the dvi and the ps file produced by
dvips) do not *clip*. I've tried inserting explicit "bb= lx ly ux uy"  (and
"trim= ...") in the includegraphics but it doesn't help. I've played around
with the viewport and it I think does the usual thing (I don't use it much)
but still no clipping.  When printed the document has no clipping.  The PDF
from ps2pdf also has no clipping. I've tried various incantations of ps2epsi
and so on, but no luck.

I'm using the following programs. Any advice appreciated:

It sounds to me like your original eps file has something strange about
it. I'd be inclined to try to run it through a filter/translator (or
several) to see if you can clean it up and get it to behave. And since
you're using pdfTeX I'd be inclined to convert it to a pdf image and use
pdflatex to generate pdf directly.

Try:

epstopdf file.eps     [this should generate a good pdf]
pdfcrop file.pdf      [this will crop it to the bounding box;
                       you can also add --margins options to
                       increase or decrease the clipping]

In my experience the above work very well, better than I can do with
lower level tools, which I always find surprising since they sit on top
of gs and latex; I can only assume that the authors are much better than
I am in getting gs and latex to work in subtle ways.

If you really need an eps at the end, you could run the result through

pdftops 

And you might try running your original through eps2eps, which does a
pretty good job at cleaning and clipping an eps (not as good as
epstopdf). Other options include using various postscript printer
drivers (and you may need to try several as they aren't the same) to
print your file to a new file and work with that.

When all the above fail, load your eps into Adobe Illustrator or some
other ps editor. If it loads, you have a chance to save it as something
clean. If really desperate, scan or convert your image to a fairly
high-resolution bitmap and crop that. Depending on what is in your
image, you might be able to use one of the bitmap tracing programs
(e.g., autotrace) to convert it back to an eps.

As a final offering, while you're beating your head against the wall,
turn through 180 degrees regularly to keep the left and right sides of
your brain equally concussed.

Subject: [texhax] Extraneous space in macro
Message-ID: <20080718114800.GA16605@netsoc.tcd.ie>

Hi,

I'm trying to write a macro that behaves like \ref but appends the
corresponding page number to a buffer. Everything is working ok, except
that I'm getting an extraneous space. Here is a reduced version that
shows the problem:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{patchcmd}

\newcommand{\Buffer}{}
\newcommand{\bref}[1]{%
\patchcommand\Buffer{}{\pageref{#1}}%
\ref{#1}}

\begin{document}

Refer to Section~\bref{sec:first}, Section~\bref{sec:second} and
Section~\bref{sec:third} (\Buffer).

\section{First section}\label{sec:first}
\section{Second section}\label{sec:second}
\section{Third section}\label{sec:third}

\end{document}

If you run the example, you will see that there is too much space in
between the "Section"s and the section numbers. I'm not sure what's
causing the problem; the problem disappears when I remove the
\patchcommand. 

Can anyone see what's going wrong? If not, is there an alternative way
to append stuff to a buffer (instead of using \patchcommand)? 

Thanks,

Edsko

Hi,

Sorry to reply to my own email, but I just found out about the existance
of \g at addto@macro; using that instead of the patchcmd package solves the
problem: 

\makeatletter
\newcommand{\Buffer}{}
\newcommand{\bref}[1]{%
\g at addto@macro\Buffer{\pageref{#1}}%
\ref{#1}}
\makeatother

Is the extraneous space a bug in patchcmd perhaps?

 Well, I owe you a pint. Too bad I don't live in London any more!  This
works *brilliantly*

Thanks so much to you and the others who offered suggestions.

Hi folks
Having learned enough to typeset reasonably elaborate mathematical

can use for maintaining consistency. I've looked at many documents 
and it would appear that peopl are more inclined to exercise 
creativity than adhere to a universal stylistic paradigm. As someone 
unable to see the outcome of a LaTeX document in PDF or DVI (because 
of my visual impairment) it is hard for me to know which one of the 
many stylistic decisions results in something decent and presentable.
Any advice on the subject, perhaps tips on style would be gratefully

TeX (and LaTeX) by themselves are all you'll need to achieve a better  
presentation than with any other typesetting system.

That said, the amsmath package fixes some spacing glitches in LaTeX,  
and if you want even more fine-tuning, in my opinion the mathtools  
package by Morten H?gholm is all you need.

Best,

Axel

I don't know about xFIG, but I tried this:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tex4ht}
\begin{document}
\section{Testing}
Hi, this is only a test.
\end{document}

saved the file as testtex4th.tex and then, in a terminal session (Mac  
or Linux, or, I guess, at the Command Prompt in Windows)

htlatex testtex4ht.tex

and I got testtex4ht.html with the above.

Hi Philip,

Thanks for the offer but this is more about presenting mathematics 
than a general question of style. I do make extensive use of both 
XHTML and CSS and have a reasonably clear mental picture of what a 
presentable document should look like. Of course, one of the biggest 
strengths of LaTeX is that you only need to concern yourself with the 
logical layout; the style files and the compiler will take care of 
that for you though it also means that I have no solid notion of what 
the document looks like in the PDF or DVI format. Where general text 
is concerned I don't really care that much. However, for maths I 
would like to develop a consistent style, preferably one adhering  to 
a recognised set of standards. For example, is there a mathematics 
equivalent of the Harvard system for typesetting essays? It's that 
sort of thing I'm after.

Cheers, Paul

None that I know of, but as a matter of fact, there isn't much freedom  
in mathematics typesetting. Regarding spacing, Latex does a really  
good job, and one should not have to change anything. (One exception  
is the eqnarray environment, which shouldn't be used, anyway.)

The only thing that I can think of is with regard to formulas that  
must be split in several lines, which can be typeset in a number of  
ways.

Okay, what about the use of the various \math?? macros - e.g. square n = n^2
How would you typeset that? What would you do with square and n? 
Perhaps something like $\mathrm{square}\mathrm{n} = n^2$
It's those decisions I'm not sure about.
Many thanks

there are some recommendations in a small book by Ellen Swanson, it's 
called mathematics into type (I think, it's in my office), some of the 
recommendation can be seen in my LaTeX book in chapter four (Kapitel 4), 
the book is in Danish, but loaded with examples.

http://www.imf.au.dk/system/latex/bog/

under the beta versions, and no, there are no plans to create an English 
version of the book.

Also the algorithms used by the breqn package are build on the same 
principles

depends on what square is, I'm not sure that n is to be upright, I would do

\DeclareMathOperator{\Square}{square}
% don't remember if \square already exists

\[
     \Square n = n^2
\]

then it is via \DeclareMathOperator, it sets it in upright letters and

TeX usually does everything correctly by default.  However, there are
some exceptions:  You'd like to write 

  y=\int f(x) \mathrm{d}x

Also "e" is usually not typeset in italics...

A very good paper which explains how to typeset math formulas,
regarding all the related ISO standards, had been published by the
PTB.  PTB stands for "Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt".  This
organisation is comparable with the National Buro of Standards in
the United States.

Rolf, the paper is outstanding, could you clear the copyright issues
with the PTB?  It would be nice if it can be part of TeX Live.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It would be very nice to have a copy in English.
         I think a good point has already been raised - when to use 
italics or bold or whatever. in
twice f x = f ( f x )
Do you use italic or normal font? How about
twice :: (alpha -> alpha) -> alpha -> alpha

That's beyond me, but I think you'll find Herbert Voss' Mathmode very  
useful:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/math/voss/mathmode/

You can just download the PDF:

http://www.ctan.org/get/info/math/voss/mathmode/Mathmode.pdf

or the whole directory bundle:

http://www.ctan.org/get/info/math/voss/mathmode.zip

to see the code he used and even compiled it yourself.

Best,

Axel

Hi Rolf,
I just found the old printed copy from 1998 deeply burried in my book
shelf.  I must correct myself, it's not about math typesetting in
general but about SI units.  It covers the upright/italic question
though.  Curiously, I don't see any copyright note.

However, since I know the title now, I had been able to consult
Google.  The 8th edition is available online already.

German:
  http://www.ptb.de/de/publikationen/download/pdf/si.pdf 

English:
  http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/si_brochure_8_en.pdf

French:
  http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/si_brochure_8_fr.pdf


Paul, though section 4.4 (upright or italic) had been dropped I think
the information you need is still there.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi,

I have a figure which I want as large as possible, but in the largest configuration the left and right margins are not equal. How can I change the margins just for this figure, without changing the settings for the whole document? I want the margin to be 2 cm on each side, and the figure as large as possible.

Thanks,

Subject: [texhax] Change in style between chapters
Message-ID: <00D42E83-FAAC-40D9-84A1-787BABD1959E@tufts.edu>

I have observed a strange behavior for which I have no explanation.
I am working on a book-length manuscript (using \documentclass[11pt] 
{book}) which is put together from many files (for individual  
sections) by a master file using \input.  I recently noticed that  
while in chapters 1 and 2 the beginning of each paragraph is indented,  
this stops beginning with chapter 3.  I have examined the three files  
comprising the last section of chapter 2 (in which the last  
paragraph---about 8 lines---is indented) as well as the file creating  
chapter 3 (with a paragraph of opening text---not indented) and the  
one creating the first section of chapter 3 (also not indented).

It would be virtually impossible for me to attach all the files I use  
to this email, but I wonder if anyone can tell me what I should be  
looking for?  I have certainly not put in anything that I conceive of  
as capable of changing the style.  Suggestions gratefully accepted.

searching the manual for 'double' gives page 10:

doublespacing Double spacing (See section 6.12: setspace)

I haven't tried it but did successfully use the package recently.

Hellow Emmanuelle,
I usually use a new command defined by

\newcommand{\note}[1]{\footnote{\begin{doublespace}#1\end{doublespace}}}

with the setspace package loaded. This has worked for me for a couple of 
years. There might well be better solutions.

Subject: [texhax] a strange problem
Message-ID: <000301c8ee9f$305e8250$c02d3344@randy9b4f288eb>

Dear Sir --

I have a tex file containing a short book, 15 or 16 pages.
Its toc is created in an automated manner using \write commands, an
auxiliary file, and requiring that the ambient file be texed twice.
Everything works fine if the book's title and the command to input the
auxiliary file are separated by a \break or an \eject.
This tells me that the commands in the auxiliary file CAN work.

I get the following error message though when the book's title and the
command to input the auxiliary file are separated by a \bigskip 
(or apparently anything that does not involve \break):
		"Runaway argument {An Equation Referenc
                        ! file ended while scanning use of \olfileline."
and the error message continues.
\olfileline is a tex macro used only in the auxiliary file and "An Equation
Referencing System." is one of its arguments.
If I continue tex after this error then tex ignores the rest of the
auxiliary file and runs to the end of the ambient file
without further error.

I've provided very little in the way of details but I don't know what else
to say without opening up a flood of details.
If this suggests anything to you then I'd very much like to hear it.

Regards -- Randy

Hi!
 
Well, I hope you don't laugh, but... I was wondering if Latex can create crochet diagrams. Seeing my girlfriend reading some international crochet diagrams, I noticed that the symbols are just the same. Japan, Finland, USA, everybody understand a diagram for doing crochet. See this picture:
 
http://www.crochetdesigns.com/howto/images/learn3a.gif
 
Sometimes, the diagram is a circle, with the symbols making several layers.
 
My doubt is: can latex make this kind of document? 
 
Thank you,Alexandre.

Hi!
 
I was trying to use the memoir package (to create a book) and then I was wondering how is the process to create an index of keywords (not to sections or chapters). For example, in the last pages from a book we see an index like this (in two columns) :
 
A
 
Al-Jazeera 2, 4-5, 9
Al Qaeda 1-3, 6, 11, 12, 112, 119, 130, 133
 
B
 
Biodiversity 90-1
Buddhism 13, 26, 86
 
 
and so on... can anybody help me?
by the way, the space between the two columns is very small... how can I change this? This is a piece of my code:
 
\usepackage{multicol}
 
\begin{document}
 
\begin{multicols}{2}
 
Some text here...
 
\end{multicols}
 
\end{document}
 
 
Thank you,
 
Alexandre.

I do not know memoir, but my first bet would be it works as in other
document styles.

within the preamble:
\makeindex

Then within the text, mark the words you want to be put into the index with
\index{keyword}

At the place where you want the index:
\input{\jobname.ind}
(I do not know if \jobname works at this place. If not, it's the same name
as your main document's name without the .tex suffix.)

To process, run through latex/pdflatex once, then through makeindex (which
creates the index), and then through latex/pdflatex again.

> by the way, the space between the two columns is very small... how can I
> change this?

If I remember correctly (I don't have the documentation at hand), 
the lenght that controls this is \multicolsep, with a default of 12pt plus
4pt minus 3pt. You can set that value using the \setlength command.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

It shows the country-code TLDs. 
 
BA Bosnia and HerzegovinaBB BarbadosBD BangladeshBE BelgiumBF Burkina Faso 
 
and so on...
 
In a .tex file, I would index the country names, but I would like that the index could show the page number and the country-code. For example:
 
Barbados 2, BA
 
Bangladesh 3, BD
 
Belgium 3, BE
 
(and so on...)

Message-ID: <311224200807300319r4246c28nfea02c8aaeb0ea64@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

To keep directories clean and tidy I fairly consistently use a
structure for my LaTeX documents using the following scheme:

proj-dir/
    Makefile
    mypaper.tex
    img/
         myimage.ps
    include/
         chapter1.tex
         chapter2.tex
    out/
         mypaper.dvi
         ...

In this setup the mypaper.tex includes the texts in the include/
directory (using \input{include/chapter1.tex}) which uses the images
in the img/ directory. I use make to generate the output.

However, sometimes (quite often actually) I want to use, say
chapter1.tex from the example above in another context, which is fine,
I can just specify the path to the file to my \input {} command. The
problem is with the graphics which are looked up relative to the
master file (mypaper.tex in the example). IOW if I include
chapter1.tex in another context I have to edit the graphics search
paths or copy all the graphics, or copy both the .tex file and the
graphics.

Is there something I'm missing here? Is there a way to specifiy the
path to included documents, graphics or otherwise, relative to the
document with the include, rather than relative to the master file?

best

Subject: [texhax] Fw: print problems with greek characters
Message-ID: <05BCF1E549DB405D9713B42CD6B76F6C@any2aaf6bdaab3>


Hi:

With TeXnicCenter, I write some greek (multiaccented) characters, then I make Build and view current file (LaTeX=>DVI). The preview is perfect (Not if I make LaTeX=>PDF, why?), but if I try to print this page (only this greek-page) the following message appears:

 TeX output 2008.07.30:2209' -> 
<tex.pro><texps.pro>. <grmn1200.pfb>
D:\TeXLive\REPOSITORY\miktex\bin\dvips.exe: ! Couldn't find font file grmn1200.pfb

I have this file grmn1200.pbf: where must I to place it?

Thanks

Gomez Bermudez, Carlos

Subject: [texhax] Soul + Babel + multiple languages conflict
Message-ID: <05062948-08B9-4A38-99B5-48D7468BF73B@gmail.com>

Hi all.

I'm using the excellent memoir class to typeset my document which is  
mostly in Russian

Reading through eye-opening and mind-boggling MemoirChapterStyles I  
decided to try and use one of the fancier styles (daleif1)

This, however, presented a problem.

The word "Chapter" is being automatically generated for each chapter.  
In Russian this word is "?????". However, since Russian is  
included via babel, hyphenation rules are automatically applied to  
this word and soul fails with "Package soul Error: Reconstruction  
failed." and forms a black square after the chapter word

Since I really like the style, i would like to find a way to suppress  
hyphenation for this automatically generated word so that soul can  
work with it.

Is there way to do that?

Here's the code for the daleif1 style:

\usepackage{color,calc,graphicx,soul,fourier}
\definecolor{nicered}{rgb}{.647,.129,.149}
\makeatletter
\newlength\dlf at normtxtw
\setlength\dlf at normtxtw{\textwidth}
\def\myhelvetfont{\def\sfdefault{mdput}}
\newsavebox{\feline at chapter}
\newcommand\feline at chapter@marker[1][4cm]{%
\sbox\feline at chapter{%
\resizebox{!}{#1}{\fboxsep=1pt%
\colorbox{nicered}{\color{white}\bfseries\sffamily\thechapter}%
}}%
\rotatebox{90}{%
\resizebox{%
\heightof{\usebox{\feline at chapter}}+\depthof{\usebox{\feline at chapter}}}%
{!}{\scshape\so\@chapapp}}\quad%
\raisebox{\depthof{\usebox{\feline at chapter}}}{\usebox{\feline at chapter}}%
}
\newcommand\feline at chm[1][4cm]{%
\sbox\feline at chapter{\feline at chapter@marker[#1]}%
\makebox[0pt][l]{% aka \rlap
\makebox[1cm][r]{\usebox\feline at chapter}%
}}
\makechapterstyle{daleif1}{
\renewcommand\chapnamefont{\normalfont\Large\scshape\raggedleft\so}
\renewcommand\chaptitlefont{\normalfont\huge\bfseries\scshape 
\color{nicered}}
\renewcommand\chapternamenum{}
\renewcommand\printchaptername{}
\renewcommand\printchapternum{\null\hfill\feline at chm[2.5cm]\par}
\renewcommand\afterchapternum{\par\vskip\midchapskip}
\renewcommand\printchaptertitle[1]{\chaptitlefont\raggedleft ##1\par}
}
\makeatother
\chapterstyle{daleif1}

Subject: [texhax] A problem running LuaTeX
Message-ID: <5088e64f0807310239g77aa09a0g72195c1405ded994@mail.gmail.com>

I have recently downloaded the beta release of LuaTeX, for Linux. I try to
generate a format and it goes right till it comes to loading the fonts. If I
say either of theses (or others):

\font\twelverm=lmroman12-regular.otf
\font\twelverm=ec-lmr12

I get the message

    not loadable: metric data not found or bad.

Needless to say, the format generates right with etex or pdftex.

Thanks for the help

I think the closed to winEdt in Linux is the Kile editor, so try that out. 
You might also want to install texlive-full instead of just texlive

note that TeXlive have nothing to do with the editor, you can use 
whichever editor you'd like.
