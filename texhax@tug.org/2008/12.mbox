Subject: [texhax] list all uncited references in bibtex file (not include)
Message-ID: <20081201055255.217010@gmx.net>

Hi,

I have a bibtex file with a lot of references. Now I'd like to see all references I haven't cited in the paper. Is that possible? I've seen a solution how to include all references in the document, but this is not what I want.

Regards,
Sebastian

Message-ID: <999898700812011435ga0ec7c5j9c12f7a8c410c44e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am preparing a manuscript for a certain journal, which demands
tables in the format

\section*{Tables}
\subsection*{Table 1 - short title for table 1}
\verb|{detailed caption for table 1}|
                    .
                    .
                    .
        remaining table
                    .
                    .
                    .


However, latex tries to fit the detailed caption in \verb in a single
row/line on the page, so that only part of the caption is actually
visible. How do i wrap this text, so that it moves over to the next
line(s) beyond pagewidth?

Thanks in advance.

Arvind

I would ask the journal, they made the demand, so they have to answer.

Perhaps more to the point, what is the "\verb" intended to
accomplish ?  Do they simply want that text monospaced, or is
there more to it than that ?

Message-ID: <1228180206.4858.27.camel@sony-sjs.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk>

(I sent this to the beamer list, but someone here may have had similar
needs and/or be interested in using or improving my hack solution)

------------------------

I have some requests for copies of my presentations over the years, and
some people would obviously prefer ppt files so they can edit them, copy
the graphics in full resolution, etc. Of course, I can't give them that,
so I offer my latex source.

This isn't always easy, as I leave the graphics files in sensible
locations (for me) and just set the GraphicsPath to find them all. With
a big presentation this can be lots of files scattered all over my
hard-drive, and I often thought about trying to automate the process.

Today, after another request, I had a go at this by writing a script
that searches through the log file, finds all the graphics (they are
called out with a very specific form: <use /home/me/images/file.png>),
generates a shell script that then copies these all, together with the
latex source, to a target directory, and finally tar's it up. I append
the script in case anyone finds it useful.

But it is a quick hack and far from perfect, so I'm wondering if someone
has done a better job, or has the interest in improving mine. Here are
some of the deficiencies:

1 It doesn't find the graphics files that are in folders specified by my
TEXINPUTS environment (nor I presume in tex's default paths) as these
don't have a full path hierarchy in the log, i.e., they look like: <use
mylogo.png>

2  As written it only packs the top level latex document (that matches
the stem of the logfile name), so any included or inputted files don't
end up in my archive (I haven't tried to solve this, so maybe it's easy
to likewise spot them)

3  It also doesn't add any custom .sty files, though distinguishing
these from the plethora of packages loaded by beamer and available in
the standard distribution is probably a nightmare.

4  It's probably very inelegant - I'm not really a script writer, more
of a hacker, in particular:

5  It will fail if the graphics file extends over three lines :-). I hit
this one because the log file wraps lines with a newline character after
79 characters.

6  To be more universal, it would be better to be written in a portable
scripting language, e.g., perl, rather than as a C-script

This is not at all pressing, but any thoughts, improvements, or
alternatives would satisfy some curiosity. I'll send this also to the
texhax mailing list, but I think it is probably more likely to be of
interest to the beamer community.

Message-ID: <d2e22f8e0812011858k39831389me78df348ccdfa30f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

For some reason I can't get LaTex to produce a greek letter with a
supercript while in a list environment. Is there any way around this issue?
Here is part of my file:

 \begin{itemize}

\item The ratio of flow depth to grain size (A)

\item the density ratio (B)

\item the Reynolds number (Re)

\item the Froude number (Fr)

*\item shear stress ($\tau$^{*})*

\end{itemize}


This doesn't work. However with the superscript it works fine. Any ideas?


Thanks


Sam

This is a pretty vague description of your problem.  As a rule, it  
helps to be specific about what is wrong, including error messages or  
"bad output".  If the example is "long", posting it on the web is  
preferable to including it in email (your minimal example here is just  
right) (if I understand what you're asking).

> However with the superscript it works fine. Any ideas?

I don't know what "with the superscript" means.

A couple of perhaps silly questions:

  - did you mean to try "exponentiation" outside the math environment?
  - are the outer '*'s just calling attention to the problematic line?

FWIW, if I use $\tau^{*}$, it typesets just fine.  Am I  
misunderstanding your problem?

It seems all I needed to do was enclose the author's name in the
BibTeX database in braces.  The result was that BibTeX, which had
previously been writing single escape sequences into the bbl file for
certain unicode characters (e.g. "\320" for "?"), instead started
writing either (correct) pairs of escape sequences, or unicode
directly into the bbl.

Thanks to several who responded. A kpsewhich tip did help me fix my
original script to pick up figures which show up in the aux file as
relative paths.

But this suggestion was much more to the point - indeed an overkill for
what I wanted, and on its own didn't quite do the job so I built
something elaborate around it before I realised that everything I needed
was provided by tex's -recorder option. So I stripped out everything
else to leave the attached script that runs any flavour of (la)tex -
pdflatex by default - with -recorder, extracts from the .fls file list
file that it generates the input files, throws away all the files in the
base texmf installation hierarchy to leave .tex files, any
user-specific .sty, etc., files, graphics files, etc., together with tha
aux, toc, bbl, etc. I think this should work with \included and
\inputted constructs, because everything is processed and recorded. The
paths in the .fls file are full paths, which makes the final stage easy
to copy them into a target directory and tar them up.

This won't always result in a set of files that will (la)tex out of the
box if the user has put variosu components in some kind of directory
structure and has built the relative paths into their latex source
(e.g., a folder containing the latex sources for individual chapters of
a book) as it flattens such a structure. In the worst case, if the same
filenames are used in different chapters it will overwrite them. But for
such a project, I'd imagine the author would organise their work anyway
and could simply bundle up the whole hierarchy.

But for my purposes of bundling up a beamer presentation for someone
else, the attached seems to work well, and there is much room for
improvement should someone be interested. :-) In particular, someone out
there will probably have a more universal way of identifying paths that
point to the texmf installation directory. My solution (by navigating
around my texlive directories) was to locate texmf.cnf and use that
directory as living above all the installation files.

Cheers
Steve

In case that email came to you personally only and not on the mailing list,
could you perhaps post the solution here too? I have the same problem, and
although I solved it, my solution is not very elegant...

Message-ID: <200812031920.mB3JKUe08205@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

The usual round of updates ...

- Software: The TeX Collection DVD was mailed a few weeks ago to all
  (non-electronic) TUG members.  It contains the new releases of TeX
  Live, ProTeXt, MacTeX, and a CTAN snapshot.
  http://tug.org/texcollection/

- TUGboat: the third issue for 2008 was mailed a few weeks ago.  The
  next TUGboat issue will appear in spring 2009.  Articles are most
  welcome, as always; the deadline for submissions is March 31.
  http://tug.org/TUGboat/

- Interview Corner: an interview with Boguslaw Jackowski and Janusz
  Marian Nowacki, with samples of many of their fonts, has been posted.
  Work on the printed book of interviews is continuing.
  http://tug.org/interviews/

- Donations: a reminder that TUG has received a renewed development
  grant from the same anonymous donor who generously provided support
  last year, including a matching challenge of $10,000.  We are raising
  some institutional support, but individual contributions of any size
  are very welcome and very important, both to TUG and to the donor.  So
  please consider donating to the development fund in general, or a
  specific development project: https://www.tug.org/donate/

- The journal Mathematics in Computer Science has issued a call for
  papers for a special issue on authoring, digitalization and management
  of mathematical knowledge, topics that have always been part of the
  TeX world.  The deadline is January 5, 2009.
  http://www-ags.dfki.uni-sb.de/~serge/admmk09/
  
- One bit of Knuthian news: Knuth is no longer routinely writing
  personal checks to finders of bugs, but creating personal certificates
  of deposit (in hexadecimal dollars) at the Bank of San Seriffe.
  http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news08.html


And the upcoming 2009 TeX conferences:

- BachoTeX 2009 will be held in Bachotek, Poland, from
  April 29-May 3, 2009.  http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2009/main-en.html

- TUG 2009 will be held at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend,
  Indiana, USA, from July 28-31, 2009.  http://tug.org/tug2009/

- EuroTeX 2009 will be held in The Hague, The Netherlands, from
  August 24-28, 2009.  http://www.ntg.nl/EuroTeX2009/

Message-ID: <1228330179.4936d4c370df6@webmail.haifa.ac.il>


Dear system support team member,

I am using Tex to create PDF files.
When I am trying to include Postscript files in the Latex file, in the dvi file
created by Tex, some of the fonts are not embedded. As a result, though the
plot is presented, some of the fonts (e.g., the titles) do not appear in the
PDF file.
Could you please advice me how to config either Tex, or the Postscript file
to overcome this problem ?
I know that this type of problem is often generated by Gnuplot.
I was told that one way to deal with it is to add the gnuplot script the
following line:
set terminal postscript eps enhanced "NimbusSanI-Regu" fontfile
 "uhvr8a.pfb" 26

However, I have no idea how to config the plot created by Tex.
Thank you in advance,
Zohar Naor

Message-ID: <20081204070551.289610@gmx.net>

Hi,

I'm using natbib and apalike as bibliography style. Basically, I don't care about the bib-style, but I need two things:

- reversed and sorted names in the bibliography section
- author access (which alpha doesn't have for instance)

My problem now is that apalike does not print locations of books for example. Apalike ignores some fields in a bibtex-entry. Can I somehow define that it will be included?

Sebastian

Two of my bibtex entries need to be cited with an url.
unfourtunately this produces an error message "missing $ inserted".
Is there a way to cite an url?
perhaps I need an additional package?

since my paper is in german, is there a good german style, who is also

Thank you, Donald! I confirm that your changes work just fine.
(but in our case we'll have to make more changes because we already have 
hooks in \@outputdblcol for correct positioning of marn output in 
twocolumn case, so there is a bit more work but it is all doable).

Thanks again for your help.

Kind regards

You don't say which TeX distribution you're using, which is important.  
I'll tell you what *I* do (TeX Live 2008 on Mac OS X):

First, to understand what's going on, please read two documents (this  
should work both with TeX Live on Linux, Mac or Windows, as well as  
with MiKTeX on Windows): at your terminal or Command Prompt type

texdoc updmap <enter>
texdoc updmap.cfg <enter>

Six pages in total.

Now (and I repeat, this is what I do, but I don't know what distro  
you're using) tell updmap to use outline fonts whenever possible and  
to always embed all fonts (the following are five lines with,  
obviously, <enter> after each one):

sudo updmap-sys --nohash --nomkmap --setoption dvipsPreferOutline true
sudo updmap-sys --nohash --nomkmap --setoption dvipsDownloadBase35 true
sudo updmap-sys --nohash --nomkmap --setoption pdftexDownloadBase14 true
sudo updmap-sys --nohash --nomkmap --setoption dvipdfmDownloadBase14  
true
sudo updmap-sys

The `` --nohash --nomkmap '' in the first four lines is just to tell  
updmap to hold any actual change until the last command.

Best,

Axel

\columnwidth is what it says, used in e.g. twocolumn mode and in the 
multicols env.

\linewidth is the current line width

\linewidth has different value depending on where you are, e.g.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \linewidth here has a different value than
\end{enumerate}
here, where it will usually be equal to \textwidth

latex and pdflatex can handle different formats, so the option tells 
graphicx to handle a specific senario.

Though I would not recommend specifying a driver (like pdftex) to 
graphicx, it can detect the right one by it self.

Though if you use dvipdfm(x) then you need to specify that driver to 
graphicx.

Hi Christian,

I can't answer your second question, but as to the first the use of url's is
extensively handled in the document apacite.pdf. If you have TeXLive you
already have this, or you can get it from your local ctan mirror.

Basically you can use either url = {...} as a bib field or you can use
\url{...} within a field, say howpublished = {...\url{...}...} for example.

Hi Sebastian,

I would not be using apalike, it is somewhat old. Instead I would be using
apacite. Using this you should find these issues are resolved and you should
not have to use natbib too, unless you want to of course.

Newbie question.  I am trying to understand where to look if I have
bibtex entries with optional fields such as month in an article entry

  author format.key output
  format.date "year" output.check
  format.title "title" output.check

Your analysis is correct: this BibTeX style does not include month and day.
Either you find a style already made that does what you want or you have to
hack the bst you're using.  The latter is relatively simple once you know
what you're doing, but you would have to learn a little of the language and
programming used.  If you feel up to it, most (I think) distros include a
file called btxhak.dvi, which explains the basics fairly well.

Good luck, Phil

Please tell us what TeX distribution you're using and how did you  
upgrade to 10.5 (Archive and Install?).

If you're using pLaTeX, then I assume you're preparing Japanese texts,  
right?

Indeed, /Users/<your-short-name>/Library/TeXShop/bin/platex2pdf-euc has

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/teTeX/bin

and /usr/local/teTeX doesn't exist any more in MacTeX; this was used  
in gwTeX, which indeed had pTeX.

Best,

Axel

You don't say which TeX distribution you are using, but if you have a  
recent release of TeX Live or MiKTeX, you *already* have XeTeX. No  
need to install anything, just update your distribution if you haven't  
done so.

> How to convert latex 2 html. Pls elaborate.

You should have a document mn.html, which is the manual for TeX4ht;  
mine, for example, is in

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/generic/tex4ht/mn.html

so look for it in the doc section of your distribution.

Best,

Axel

I put

  \RequirePackage{snapshot}

before the \documentclass line, and it produces a .dep file containing
(most of) the .sty files used (not sure why it misses some).  Then I run

  bundledoc <file>.dep

which makes a .tar file with the required files.

This doesn't handle the images used, but is useful for archival purposes
in case I need to re-run latex some time far in the future and want to
use exactly the same .sty files.

I'm curious how it compares with mkjobtexmf, if anyone knows.

In addition to the manual which Axel mention (online at
http://www.tug.org/applications/tex4ht/), you might also find Eitan's
intro article useful.  E.g., see the table on the first page of
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb25-1/gurari.pdf

Running 
  htlatex foo.tex 
will convert a straightforward latex file foo.tex to foo.html.

Hope it helps,

Why would you do that?

Why not install TeXLive for win32? You get everything you need and it  
all works.

Winshell is a windows app but cygwin is a linux emulator. Two  
different OSs.

First, please excuse me for not replying sooner.

Congratulations for installing MiKTeX 2.7. I guess you can now  
uninstall 2.5, right?

I don't use Windows, so I can't tell you much, but I see here

http://www.toolscenter.org/about/about-texniccenter

that TeXnicCenter has a Configuration Wizard, that needs you to tell  
it where your TeX distribution is.

And congratulations for using LaTeX.

Best,

Axel

I don't see why not.  The second form might fit in text better.

I would write $\sqrt{\sum d^2/2n}$, but extra braces would not hurt.  

You are rgiht:  in inline equations it is better to avoid \frac, using
slashes instead.

the first should be avoided, looks awful.

I don't see any problems with the second one, though some might prefer

$\sqrt{\sum d^2/(2n)}$

But I routinely write /2n

When I write for the programmers, I routinely use brackets in such
situations.  When I write for the general audience, I usually omit
them.

I typeset $\sqrt{\frac{\sum d^2}{2n}}$ using package nath and the output 
is equivalent to $\sqrt{(\sum d^n)/2n}$ which seems to avoid ambiguity 
about what is being summed.

Well, as everyone says, the second, in-line, is clearly more pleasing to the
eye.  But this is more a question of type-setting ethics than hacking TeX
;-)

However, you may want to tweak the spacing a little, like this:

$\sqrt{\sum d^2\!/\,2n}$

And, of course, your extra braces are entirely redundant - I try to avoid
extra braces as it reduces the readability of the input file and also it's
easy to lose a brace when editting.

Cheers,  Phil

Message-ID: <4942DCDD.70801@cs.ucsd.edu>

Hello,

I am trying to install the Monotype Christmas fonts (chra/mpi007 etc.) 
but have had no success.
I have followed the steps of Fulko van Westrenen  (July 2007) 
www.umantec.nl/fontinst
through the name changing step. The fontinst step doesn't seem to 
produce anything
useful.

Does this installation process work with these non-alphabetic fonts?    
If not,  how should
I proceed?

Many thanks in advance.

Hi Walt,
font related problems are always quite nasty and not many TeX users
are familiar with the innards of a TeX system, especially if fonts are
concerned. 

The font/fontinst experts are subscribed to:

  http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/fontinst

I suppose that you get more help there.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] index entries in latex/makeindex
Message-ID: <A296BCED-D846-4426-8BA0-75FEBD72ECD4@tufts.edu>

In a book I am writing in latex (using makeindex to generate the  
index) I am running into a confusing anomaly.

The following macros are among those I have to generate index entries:
***********************************************************************************
\newcommand{\namerefindex}[4]{\index{#2, #1 (#3-#4)}}%prints name,  
date in index not text
\newcommand{\namerefsilent}[4]{#1\  #2\ (#3-#4)}%prints name, date in  
text not index
\newcommand{\nameref}[4]{#1\  #2\ (#3-#4)\namerefindex{#1}{#2}{#3}{#4}} 
%prints name, date in text
\newcommand{\namesubref}[5]{\index{#2, #1 (#3-#4)!#5}}%prints subentry  
in index
**************************************************************************************
(the usage is: \nameref{Firstname}{Lastname}{Birthdate}{Deathdate}
and in the subref, #5 is an index entry under the entry above.

I have discovered that references made using \namerefsilent followed  
by \namesubref
work fine, but those generated using \nameref fail to show up in the  
index.


Any explanation?

Message-ID: <C8847AC1-8A57-45BF-A5FE-AE4FFFD1B9F7@tufts.edu>

Earlier, I posted a question concerning index entries.  The problem  
looks even more subtle than I first thought.

To recall,
In a book I am writing in latex (using makeindex to generate the  
index) I am running into a confusing anomaly.

The following macros are among those I have to generate index entries:
***********************************************************************************
\newcommand{\namerefindex}[4]{\index{#2, #1 (#3-#4)}}%prints name,  
date in index not text
\newcommand{\namerefsilent}[4]{#1\  #2\ (#3-#4)}%prints name, date in  
text not index
\newcommand{\nameref}[4]{#1\  #2\ (#3-#4)\namerefindex{#1}{#2}{#3}{#4}} 
%prints name, date in text
\newcommand{\namesubref}[5]{\index{#2, #1 (#3-#4)!#5}}%prints subentry  
in index
**************************************************************************************
(the usage is: \nameref{Firstname}{Lastname}{Birthdate}{Deathdate}
and in the subref, #5 is an index entry under the entry above.

Included in the same macro file are the following:
***********************************************************
\newcommand{\Descartesref}{\nameref{Ren\'e}{Descartes}{1596}{1650}}
\newcommand{\Fermatref}{\nameref{Pierre de}{Fermat}{1601}{1665}}
************************************************************************
and the following paragraph appears in my text:
****************************************************************
The idea of using a pair of numbers in this way to locate a point in  
the plane was pioneered in the early seventeenth cenury by  
\Fermatref{} and \Descartesref{}.  By means of such a scheme, a plane  
curve can be identified with the \deffontcustom{locus}{locus!of  
equation} of points whose coordinates satisfy some equation;  the  
study of curves by analysis of the corresponding equations, called  
\deffont{analytic geometry}, was initiated in the research of these  
two men.  Actually, it is a bit of an anachronism to refer to  
rectangular coordinates as ``Cartesian'', since both Fermat and  
Descartes often used \deffontcustom{oblique coordinates}{Coordinate  
System!oblique}, in which the axes make an angle other than a right  
one.\footnote{We shall explore some of the differences between  
rectangular and oblique coordinates in \refer{ex}{oblique}.}   
Furthermore, Descartes in particular didn't really consider the  
meaning of negative values for the abcissa or ordinate.
*********************************************************************************************
Ignore the \deffontcustom and \refer commands;  they involve totally  
different stuff.

When I run the full book text as described above, I get an error  
messages referring to the
paragraph quoted above:
********************************************************************************
LaTeX Warning: Reference `Pierre de' on page 2 undefined on input line  
52.

?
*************************************************************************************
When I replace \'e with e in the \Descartesref macro, I don't get the  
missing \encsname
error, but the printed text has, where the two references are, the  
following (I was unable to copy and paste off my pdf, so am retyping  
what I see;  the stuff in [ ] is a description):
************************************************************************************
...century by ??Fermat16011665 and ??[\'e, printed properly]Descartes.

**********************************************************************************
and neither entry appears in the index.


HOWEVER, when I isolate all of this in a test file, inserting the same  
paragraph there, and calling the same macros file,
everything works fine.

I am at a total loss as to what to even look for.  Any suggestions  
would be much appreciated.

It's an expansion issue.

You need to define the \'e as a ``protected command'' so that it'll  
only be expanded later (or use an indexing tool which is 8-bit safe  
and enter it as ?)

Try:

\newcommand{\LCacuteE}{\'e}

\newcommand{\PLCacutee}{\protect\LCacuteE}

> \newcommand{\Descartesref}{\nameref{Ren\PLCacutee}{Descartes}{1596} 
> {1650}}

You might need to add a second level (a protected command in between  
the two I defined above and have the last call the middle command).

Look into your .log file. I'm quite sure that you see that nameref.sty
(coming with hyperref.sty) is loaded \AtBeginDocument, which (re)defines
to produce a \ref. The error you get says that the corresponding \label
is missing.

Indeed, when I thought of the matter while shopping, I had forgotten the first
example and thought \sum(d^2/2n) was ment, \sum binding the variable n.
I haven't done math for a while and only now see that this series diverges,
but it may show that the notation is significantly ambiguous in the way Aditya
says (not with respect to 2n). And even if the reader knows what is meant
from the context, such ambiguities may distract attention.

Great to learn about nath!

There are also Cygwin binaries available for TeX Live 2008, compiled
by Angelo Graziosi.  They can be downloaded from:

  http://www.webalice.it/angelo.graziosi/cygwin/texlive/texlive.html

However, the Windows binaries provided by TeX Live or MikTeX should
work on Cygwin too.  If you decide to use them, you could also try

  http://tug.org/~kotucha/xdvi-cygwin.zip

The zip file is supposed to be extracted in the directory containing
all the other TeX binaries.

Please note that it works on Cygwin only but not on native Windows.
The reason is that an X11 server is required.

Faraz, coming back to your original question, 

   The NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction.

I'm definitely not a Windows expert, but I found the following link:

   http://www.techimo.com/forum/technical-support/117644-ntdvm-cpu-has-encountered-illegal-instruction.html

I have the impression that Michael Chiew knows much more about Windows
than me (no wonder).  Don't know whether it helps to solve your
problem, but maybe it helps to understand the error message.

In short, "NTVDM" stands for "NT Virtual Dos Machine".

Regards,
  Reinhard

My repairing posting didn't suffice to make my point clear:
If nameref.sty is loaded \AtBeginDocument, it defines its own
\nameref, overwriting your definition. \nameref then expands to a
\ref, not to an \index.

It is easy to find out whether I'm right, most simple perhaps:
right after \begin{document}, type \show\nameref.
This should show the definition of \nameref on the screen.
I would like to know whether it is yours or another one.
If I'm right, you will have \protect\T at nameref on your screen.

I guess hyperref.sty is loaded by some other package
you are using anyway, maybe you use the memoir class
which contains many other packages.

Best,
   Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] CMYK color v. RGB
Message-ID: <494B8FC9.4060301@uit.co.uk>

We've just had a book printed, and there are a few color problems:
more or less consistently, some blues come out looking a little
too green, and others look purple.  The printing company say this is probably due to
the RGB -> CMYK color conversion, and say that we should
ensure images are in CMYK format rather than RGB before
they are embedded in the PDF.

We're using LaTeX, Xfig, GNUplot, Metapost, and all the usual
tools on Linux.  We produce the book as PostScript, and then
ps2pdf that, to send to the printers.

I don't think it's possible for us to use CMYK.  Is it?
Does anyone else have experience of similar problems?

	Thanks,
	Niall

ps: we had advance review copies printed digitally.  They were
     fine; only the litho copies were weird.  The printers say
     it wasn't a problem with their inking of the litho machine,
     and insofar as I understand what they are talking about, I
     believe them.

have you had a look at xcolor? Though you might want to use pdflatex 
directly, not sure if postscript actually support cmyk.

Sure it is. You just need to introduce a step where you colour- 
separate (and if necessary adjust) all images. You'll also need to  
specify any colours for text or vector elements using CMYK (post- 
processing them if need be in a pre-press-oriented tool like FreeHand  
or Adobe Illustrator).

In theory you could adjust so that they display nicely w/ an RGB  
colour profile which has a gamut which your printer can separate to in  
a fashion you find acceptable and tag the images w/ that profile and  
then the separation would work, but that demands colour-calibrated  
displays &c.

The digital machines are usually RGB-oriented and have a wider gamut  
than machines which have to print ink in multiple passes.

You should've gotten a colour-separated contract proof which the  
printer was able to match on press.

I'm not a colour expert at all, but have hit a couple of things in the
past, one of which is that some ghostscript-based scripts (such as
ps2pdf or epstopdf) set options that are not always optimal, such as

-dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress  (which epstopdf uses instead of /default
or /printer)

Also, if you read the Ps2pdf.htm documentation (it should live in the
same directory as the ghostscript Use.htm documentation) you will see
that there are a number of colour-related options you can pass to ps2pdf
to control RGB vs CMYK, and probably things like colour depth which may
well affect the result. Maybe this will help.

Postscript is exactly where such conversions between color mappings take 
place. 

Complete graphics packages like Illustrator come with elaborate filters 
to make the conversions. 

It is a great pity that Illustrator cannot be run under Unix directly, 
but with qemu it can be run in a
qemu Windows window. 

RGB was designed for display screens, and works on an entirely different 
color model from
CMYK.  One of the good things about Illustrator is that it gives you the 
CMYK values for
Pantone inks, which can be used in epsf specials. Here for instance is 
the code
to produce PANTONE 179 U taken from a plain TeX file.  The advantage of this
is that it uses the PANTONE CMYK values for the inks.  The color on the 
display, or
on an Inkjet or Laser printer may not be quite the same, but it doesn't 
matter.  The
PANTONE color is going to be pretty standard all across the printing 
industry.

\ORNtext={\special{ ps:gsave [/Separation (PANTONE 179 U)
[/DeviceCMYK] {dup 0.0 mul exch dup 0.79 mul exch dup 1 mul exch
0.0 mul}]setcolorspace}\box1\special {ps:grestore}}

All that to write \box1 in red-orange, rather than black.

I use an HP inkjet for color proofs, and my understanding is that the HP 
printer
drivers do CMYK -> RGB conversions even though the ink cartridges would
seem to be more appropriate for CMYK, by the very fact that they are ink 
cartridges.

you can use the programs "pnmtotiffcmyk" and "convert" to convert RGB
image files (e. g. in PPM format) into CMYK-JPEGs; here are Makefile
example rules:

%-cmyk.jpg:     %-cmyk.tif
	convert $< -colorspace CMYK -density 300x300 -quality 100 $@

%-cmyk.tif:     %.ppm
	pnmtotiffcmyk $< > $@

These JPEGs can be read by pdftex without problems (but you might
encounter transparency problems with buggy RIPs, as recently happened).

Is

somewhere in the document preamble (after \documentclass) OK?
What I wonder about: "Part" doesn't appear in the TOC anyway.

For ways of using your own design without dirty tricks, there are
nccsect.sty from the ncctools bundle and the memoir class.

Hi all,
Would anyone with prior experience guide me to config LaTeX to support
Chinese, or give me some reference.
I am currently using CentOS 5.2 on my laptop.
I am pleased to provide any information needed.
Many thanks!

These are the various parameters that can be tweaked for general floats
although I can't unfortunately remember exactly what each does - so I hope
it is more-or-less obvious.

\renewcommand{\topfraction}{.85}
\renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{.7}
\renewcommand{\textfraction}{.15}
\renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{.66}
\renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{.66}
\renewcommand{\dblfloatpagefraction}{.66}
\setcounter{topnumber}{9}
\setcounter{bottomnumber}{9}
\setcounter{totalnumber}{20}
\setcounter{dbltopnumber}{9}

Hello
?
Is there any command or way to get the current output position (xy coordinate) of things. I need a comand that can capture the position like 
?
\xyposition{words or things in there}
\currentpagenumber
?
so i can use?them in a if command and create the output as I want. Or, is there a way to writing these information to .aux file and using them by reruning LaTeX. Although LaTeX is doing the page layout, I need more control on?position of things in output.
?
Thank you

Greetings!

I don't know if it's in Protext, but the fullpage package may also be
useful for this. Instead of having you change page settings
specifically, it allows you to apply some changes that one would
commonly want.

Sincerely,

Christopher

Page number and similar are stored as counters in LaTeX. Here's a
useful link in that regard:
http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/teTeX/latex/latex2e-html/ltx-3.html

...
> \xyposition{words or things in there}

As for your first question, I don't know the answer. But I do have a
few ideas on where to get them.

 This sort of thing _should_ be a part of TeX, so you may want to look
at the relevant documentation. I don't have a copy of the TeXbook my
self so I generally reference TeX by Topic which is free and will
likely have the answers your looking for.

 Someone will probably come along with the answer shortly, but if your
in a rush the source code is always the best documentation... Maybe
look at the code for the pspicture environment? It goes and makes
LaTeX jump around on the X and Y axis...

If you are asking because you want to put something at a particular
point on a page, look at \rput from pstricks.


Best of Luck!

Christopher

I don't know if you'll get the precision you seem to be looking for, but
you should try playing with \pagetotal, which is a length that marks
where you are on the page (measured from the top), and creeps up (down)
towards \pagegoal.  When it gets to \pagegoal, the page-completing
machinery clanks into action.  Anyway, you might experiment with those
and see if that can't get you where you hope to go.  One little
weirdness is that I think \pagegoal isn't set until something 
is applied to the page. 

I am not aware of anything similar in the X direction, though.

Good luck,

 -tom

... a very inspiring and/or hard question.

One thing: what /units/ do you want to should the coordinates measured by?

Y. One possibility for y: unit /line number/.
With the lineno package, you can mark a position by, e.g., 
\linelabel{whoohoo!}.
At the second LaTeX run after doing this, \pageref {whoohoo!} will obtain
the page number of that position, and \ref{whoohoo!} will obtain its line 
number
on the same page. (On special occasions only, \thepage my work like 
\pageref{whoohoo!}.)

Y-. What is a `line'? (a) LaTeX offers in-line tables, such a table 
occupies a single `line'
(numbering lines will ignore such tables). (b) Alternatively, you may want 
to consider each row of a table a `line', this may change counting `lines' 
-- (c) or even: cells of tables may have more lines than one, and you may 
want to count them too -- oh, please, no!

Y+. One might think of a /geometrical/ unit like: "how many pt below the
top of the page is ...'' ... very hard ... my advice: forget it!
[or ask Donald Arseneau and/or David Kastrup]

X. As for the `x' coordinate, the previous approach may provoke questions
"How far is it from here to the left margin, or to the right margin?"
A question like this once was discussed here ... I gave an idea,
but how much money will you give for ...!??

Z. As for coordinates in terms of pt, TeX will be little helpful,
but perhaps PDFTeX can help you!?

... ahm,

     Uwe.

In order just to obtain the page number: \pageref{foo} is the number of the 
page
where \label{foo} is -- roughly ... this works with the LaTeX kernel already,
no special package needed.

Indeed, on

     \documentclass{article}
     \begin{document}
     A

     \vspace{\textheight}
     Z\the\pagetotal
     \end{document}

Z appears with a large pt value, while it is very close to the top of the 
second page.

So ain't I,

>Good luck,
indeed, I have always considered this more outright than `Happy TeXing',

I wasn't clear.  \pagetotal is the accumulated distance from the top of
the page, and when it *exceeds* \pagegoal, the machinery clanks and a
new page is output.  But sometimes not right away, either.  Your example
can be made even more entertaining:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\the\pagegoal A

\vspace{\textheight}
Z\the\pagetotal\the\pagegoal

\the\pagetotal\the\pagegoal

\the\pagetotal\the\pagegoal

\the\pagetotal\the\pagegoal

\the\pagetotal\the\pagegoal

\the\pagetotal\the\pagegoal

\end{document}

You'll see that the counters are close to page coordinates, but since
the underlying design required something else, they are something else.

Hi Tom,
I doubt that this is a good advice.  The only reasonable solution is
what Martin proposed.

Your last sentence describes the problem:  The page breaking algorithm
doesn't care about \pagegoal and \pagetotal at all.  You are virtually
writing on endless paper, but whenever a paragraph is finished, the
output routine is called.  If the page is not full at the end of a
particular paragraph, nothing spectacular happens.  Otherwise the last
paragraph has to be split.  The first part appears on page $n$ and the
second part appears on page $n+1$.

Now assume that you convince TeX to print the values of \pagegoal and
\pagetotal to screen.  If you do it at the very end of a paragraph
which doesn't fit on a page completely, you'll notice that \pagetotal
is larger than \pagegoal.  If you ask for the page number, TeX will
tell you that you are still on page $n$ while the stuff actually goes
to page $n+1$.

Where things appear on a page is only known after the output routine
had been run and a new page had been shipped out.

If you really want to know where on the page you are, you have to wait
until the page is shipped out.  This means that you have to modify the
output routine.  But this is extremely difficult and not advisable.

The only reasonable solution is what Martin proposed.  Everything else
is inaccurate and unreliable and not worth to consider.

Regards,
  Reinhard

No!  See my previous mail.  Absolutely nothing happens when \pagetotal
exceeds \pagegoal.  The machinery simply doesn't work this way.

This is useless.  Put these commands into paragraphs containing text,
one near the beginning and one near the end of each paragraph and see
what happens when a page break occurs.

Use the pdfTeX primitives suggested by Martin instead.  Everything
else is useless.

  Reinhard

To the OP: Reinhard is mostly right and you should take Martin's advice.
My advice is impractical, perhaps, but it works.  Some years ago I used
\pagegoal and \pagetotal in a package to insert predefined material on
specific pages throughout a document, and it works ok for me.  See
examples at whatcheer.net, in the newsletter archive section on the left
side.  The masthead, subscription form, and mailer are all handled this
way.

Thanks,

 -tom

PDFTeX has \pdfsavepos, \pdflastxpos, \pdflastypos.  That's actually
tolerably easy to use and has for some years also worked in DVI mode.

A question about the frequent mention in this thread of pdftex, or 
pdflatex:  it has been my understanding that as a frequent user of 
pstricks (a marvelous tool!) I cannot use pdflatex (and routinely go 
the dvi-postscript route, sometimes into pdf).

Is this true? Is pdflatex still unable to "do" pstricks?

On the other hand, pstricks seems to have awareness of the "current 
position" on the page, which I occasionally use by trial-and-error.  is 
there a way to get pstricks to tell us where is what?


Thank you,                    --Micha Hofri

Sort of, it can't do the "ps" part. You can use e.g. pdftricks [1] to get around
this though.

Is this true? Then webmaster_at_PSTricks.de (for above web page) should be 
informed.

Maybe almost nobody knows how to run pdfTeX in dvi mode on a LaTeX file, e.g.:
+ how to modify the local `pdflatex' command for this
+ how to make the favourite GUI TeX shell do this

While processing input not containing any \par, the expansion of 
\the\pagetotal won't change [1]. So e.g., if you have an author like 
Heinrich von Kleist where a sentence may fill more than a page (f. Exercise 
14.15 in the TeXbook) \the\pagetotal may expand to `0pt' all over the page. 
This means that \the\pagetotal may not give any clue as to the vertical 
position on the page. Rather it will just indicate the vertical position at 
which the previous paragraph ended.

Cheers,

     Uwe

You just run 'latex'. It now mostly uses pdfTeX, you know. :-)

Or you read the beautiful pdftex manual, where you will find the
\pdfoutput switch.

`_' is a standard TeX matter. I experience here and myself that there are 
installations nowadays that don't stop at errors, so many users don't 
realize them! In your .log file, you will find `missing $ inserted'; in the 
old times, TeX stopped to tell you this on screen. `_' is only allowed in 
math mode, not in ordinary text. To get an underscore symbol, type `\_'. 
`_' in text doesn't really switch to italics, rather TeX treats it as `$_' 
and considers all following text a mathematical formula, until it finds a 
`$' or a \par. You also should have noticed that the first character after 
`_' appears as a subscript, that's what `_' is for.

The TeXbook lists all these special characters on page 36. Perhaps looking 
for `category code' helps to find explanations of all of them in various 
documents on TeX and LaTeX.

I am astonished that `"' should switch to something like italics. babel.sty 
and german.sty use it for generating certain language-specific letters or 
characters. Using it for quoting is ``deprecated'' in TeX which was made 
for high typographic ambitions.

Best,

     Uwe.

Message-ID: <20081229035411.GK10043@cpe-67-241-17-133.twcny.res.rr.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to use symbols in an AMS LaTeX document similar to the
\nwfilledspoon and \sefilledspoon (for those unfamiliar, these are
diagonal arrows with solid circles instead of arrowheads).  These
symbols are provided as part of the MnSymbol package.  Unfortunately,
MnSymbol conflicts with AMS symbols and fonts, both of which I use
heavily (I've looked into working around these conflicts, but it's
proving problematic --- unless anyone has an easier method than those
discussed in the _The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List_).

Based upon advice from _The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List_, I've
decided to try to construct replicas of these symbols, using other
existing ones (AMS or otherwise).  This is where I'm having trouble.
I've consulted the aforemented guide, as well as the TeXHaX mailing
archive, the _LaTeX Companion_ (2nd edition), and Gratzer's _Math
into LaTeX_.

Here's my thought process:

Take a simple diagonal arrow (say: \searrow or \nwarrow) and position
a bullet over the arrowhead.  The bullet is large enough to cover the
arrowheads (especially when bolded) and it could simulate the above
\sefilledspoon or \nwfilledspoon.  The main problem is that I'm having
trouble controlling the vertical placement of the bullet.  The
horizontal overlap is easy enough with suitable negative mspace.  I'm
able to get the bullet higher using \overset's and \vphantom's
(though, it's annoying that I seem to lose the \boldsymbol on the
bullet, which helps fully obstruct the arrowheads, when I use
\overset).  However, it's been hard to get the bullet just a bit lower
(\underset positions it too low, and no \vphantoms seem to help).

I'm avoiding \overset, \stackrel, etc. on the *actual* arrows, but
instead using separate \vphantom's, as I don't want the bullet
centered horizontally on the arrow, since I need it to occlude the
arrowheads on the endpoints.

Here are some of my failed attempts:

$\boldsymbol{\bullet\mspace{-14mu}\nwarrow}$
$\boldsymbol{\searrow\mspace{-14mu}\bullet}$

$\boldsymbol{\overset{\bullet}{\vspace{2ex}}\mspace{-12mu}\nwarrow}$

$\boldsymbol{\overset{\bullet}{\vphantom{\rule{0em}{0.4ex}}}\mspace{-12mu}\nwarrow}$
$\boldsymbol{\searrow\mspace{-12mu}\underset{\bullet}{\vphantom{\rule{0em}{-5.0ex}}}}$

I'd be grateful for any and all suggestions.

Thanks,
Daniel

Please see lshort.pdf, page 5 for how to input special characters in
LaTeX. In case you want to quote a URL, have a look at url.sty (the
manual can be found in the source code). For more packages producing
verbatim output, see the TeX Catalogue.

I have done this sort of thing by using \raisebox for vertical and \kern for 
horizontal movement, but there must be a more robust and elegant way, so I'll 
be interested in other replies !

If you really want to compose (running just TeX) new glyphs from existing 
ones, you should know how the latter were designed (and how they are coded 
in METAFONT), in terms of font dimensions, cf. TeXbook p. 433/447; or of 
the height of `(' (\mathstrut) ... and in your macros, you should refer to 
these (\fontdimen, ...) [I can't tell details here]. Referring to such 
dimensions would be better than trying various numbers ... Replacing the 
arrowhead with a bullet, you should refer to the height and width of the 
box enclosing the diagonal stroke and to the width of the bullet and the 
height of its center (I guess it's axis_height according to TeXbook p. 
447). Don't forget \mathpalette ...

But John: I wonder whether you are asking about creating new glyphs or just 
about placing one character over another. The latter task usually requires 
dimensions of enclosing boxes only; it can be performed through one-column 
``tables'' (\oalign) or through the \accent primitive (depends ...). Are 
you thinking of specific examples that have bothered you?

HTH -- Uwe.

There is nothing wrong if new symbols are composed with \kern and
\raisebox.  Everything which works is fine.  However, the most
reasonable approach is to check whether a particular symbol exists
already: 

  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf

This should always be the first step.

Regards,
  Reinhard
