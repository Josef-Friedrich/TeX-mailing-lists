Hi Reinhard,

yes, those are very good points and well taken. I have certainly been able
to answer most of my own questions from the documentation and I also found
some answers to other questions by reading many of the threads here. So
it's probably not true to say that I have received no benefits. I was
probably more annoyed by the phrasing of some of the responses that I got,
but once again, I'm sure noone meant any offence or harm.

With some more experience, I might be able to start helping others as well.

cheers, Bruce

If anyone has joined TUG and is not satisfied, please ask office at tug.org
for a refund.

To recap what I wrote yesterday:

The main tangible benefit of joining TUG is TUGboat.
(And the software on physical discs, but that's all downloadable.)

The main intangible benefit is supporting the world of TeX.

(http://tug.org/aims_ben.html has the whole list of all the other
benefits.)

We are always open to ideas for new benefits the user groups can offer.
In today's electronic world, they are not so easy to come up with.

Best,
Karl (TUG president)

    The second question got no responses 

Looking at the archives, I think this was that unanswered question:

    I am using the package \usepackage{harvard} and then using the agsm
    style. I can't get \citationmode{abbr} to work (which I placed in
    the preamble) but all other aspects of the package seem to
    work...\citeyear etc.

Unfortunately I've never used the harvard package myself, but I can suggest 
(a) posting an actual document with the problem, and
(b) saying what you expected to happen, i.e., what "doesn't work" mean
    -- an error from TeX, incorrect/missing output, or whatever.

That would help other people to help.

Most package authors welcome bug reports, too, especially given the
information above so they can reproduce the problem.

Best,
Karl

Thanks Karl,

yes, that was the question. I managed to fix it myself by changing to a
different package. I don't have the details here, so I won't try to go
into it further!

Essentially, when I used the \citationmode{abbr} to abbreviate the
refereces, it had no effect and they failed to abbreviate in the output. I
tried varoius ways and means, but to no avail.

But there are many ways to solve a problem and I used a completely
different package which did the job perfectly!

Thanks very much for looking this up. Much appreciated.

cheers, Bruce

Simple ethics is another ---we (people like me) are profiting from  
the work of other people, be it financially or just for the Joy of  
TeX. The least we can do is help a little with the administrative  
expenses that involves maintaining such a wonderful work.

I'm not a scientist (wish I were! but I'm not), as someone said  
recently in this list; I'm a copy-editor and typographer at heart (I  
even learned to use a composing stick when I was a kid).  
Unfortunately afraid of TeX for many years, I dwelt in the  
QuarkXPress & rivals world for a long time. Then, thanks to the  
Macintosh TeX community (and some books), I took the plunge and  
started learning LaTeX.

TeX is what makes my blood bubble like using a composing stick did.

Yes, I do; yes, I do; yes, I do; yes, I do. And almost every reply  
from me consists of a referral to documentation, or to a package that  
has helped me for a similar problem or even to another mailing list.

I might be guilty of the first, but I won't apologize. :-)

Newbies often have enormous preambles in their documents which have
been copied over generations of LaTeX users without anybody really
understanding the preambles (or LaTeX). So it makes sense to first cut
down the document to the absolute minimum and try to understand what
all the packages do.

Ok Martin,

I accept your non-apology! And you are quite correct on the second point! I
did cut it down somewhat after that, but in fact I was really using many of
those packages :-)

The GUST e-foundry team (Bogus\l{}aw Jackowski and Janusz M. Nowacki)
released version 1.106 of the Latin Modern family of fonts on January
22, 2008.

There is quite a number of enhancements and changes made in response to
the comments and suggestions by users. All is detailed  in the
lm-hist.txt file available via the download section of the Latin Modern
page hosted by GUST
(http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern). The fonts
itself may also be downloaded from there.

In due course the new version will replace the version 1.010 currently
on CTAN.

This is just what I was after! Thanks.

I found this worked well in the preamble:

\usepackage{floatpag}
\floatpagestyle{plain}

So by default they had the same style as the other pages. Then I can
just turn off the ones that are too large.

Cheers,

Andrew.

It's not possible to do this in a generic way, so that it works with
any glyphs, not just A and B, because TeX doesn't know anything about
the actual glyph shapes, it only knows about glyph boxes (which are
rectangular).  So the only way to do this is to insert spacing tweaks,
something like:

  A \!\!\! \rightarrow \!\!\!B\cr

\! is a predefined (by plain TeX) negative skip macro for the math
mode.  You should define skip macros for math mode in terms of mu's,
not pt's, like this:

  \def\myskip{\mskip-5mu}

Oleg

Message-ID: <2C2CDBC4-9FBB-4A07-A6C0-76681E68CE73@bu.edu>

Dear Sir/Madam,

I joined this morning TUG. I downloaded the MacTeX-2007 Package from  
your website and went through installation on my new MacBook Pro with  
a newly installed Leopard (10.5.1 with the updates downloaded two  
days ago from the internet).

When I typeset a document (LaTeX or plain TeX), I get the following  
message:

*****************************
Can't find required tool
/usr/local/teTeX/in/i386-apple-darwin-current/pdftex does not exist.
Perhaps TeXLive was not installed or was removed during a system  
upgrade.
If so go the the TeXShop web site and follow the instructions to (re) 
install TeXLive.
Another possbility is that a tool path is incorrectly configured in  
TeXShop preferences.
*****************************

I thought that the package was self-contained. Do I have to wait for  
the CD (with my TUG membership I ordered extra the TeX Live CD).

Since I followed the standard procedure, I presume I am not the only  
one to have experienced that.

Any help to relieve my frustration would be most welcome.


Best,


Christophe Chamley

Something went wrong during installation. Please subscribe to the TeX  
on Mac OS X mailing list

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

and provide as much information as you can. I assure you you'll have  
a working installation very soon.

> I thought that the package was self-contained.

Yes, it is. I have installed in 3 machines without a problem (in  
Tiger, though; not Leopard).

No ---the disk image you downloaded is more recent and has a script  
necessary for Leopard.

I don't recall any, but please ask in said mailing list.

So sorry I didn't spot this before! But no ---the TeXShop (and any  
other front-end) path should be

/usr/texbin

which is a symbolic link for any active TeX distribution on the Mac  
(TeXLive ---a.k.a. MacTeX---, gwTeX, teTeX, fink or MacPorts).

But, anayway, Christophe, I advise you to join the TeX on Mac OS X  
mailing list.

Axel

Ok, but is it possible that this symlink erroneously points to

   /usr/local/teTeX/in/i386-apple-darwin-current/pdftex

instead of

   /usr/local/teTeX/bin/i386-apple-darwin-current/pdftex

?  I'm not a Mac user and can't reproduce anything.  But a directory
called "in" looks quite strange.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, of course you're right. Typos apart, I don't how Christophe got  
that path: /usr/local/teTeX/bin/i386-apple-darwin-current/ was the  
path in Gerben Wierda's 2005 teTeX distribution, before gwTeX, and  
certainly before MacTeX.

In fact, the i386-apple-darwin-current directory was itself a  
symbolic link to, well, the ``current'' directory with the binaries;  
last was, I think, i386-apple-darwin8.6.1.

MacTeX doesn't install teTeX, but texlive; and all current front-ends  
have by default the path set to /usr/texbin, which, as said, is a  
symlink to the distro the user wants to use, which she or he can  
choose in a control panel (provided, of course, she or he has  
installed more than one).

Best,

Axel

TeXShop is really a front-end to a TeX distribution. I guess what you  
mean is you're using gwTeX. But be sure, when you install MacTeX,  
that you have the latest TeXShop version; see

With our membership we receive a DVD with distributions for Linux,  
Mac (MacTeX) and Windows, but you'll have to wait till summer for  
TeXLive 2008. You can download MacTeX from

http://www.tug.org/mactex/

If you subscribe to the TeX on Mac OS X mailing list

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

you'll find there people like Richard Koch and other MacTeX  
maintainers, always willing to help us.

If the problem is that your computer is looking for teTeX but in fact  
has installed TeXLive (as it should have) try the following.
Go to System Preferences. There should be an icon on the bottom line  
called something like "TeX distribution." If you open that preference
you can choose between teTeX and TeXLive. I think that should solve  
your problem.

Maybe with \input, but I assume they both have their own preamble. You
probably have to rearrange things.

You could also concatenate pdf files

 http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages/pdfpages.pdf

but you'll lose hyperlinks.

I'm using the excellent fancyvrb.sty package, but
have run into a problem:

   \VerbatimInput[firstline=5,lastline=6]{test.txt}

works fine, and prints lines 5 to 6 inclusive, as expected.
However:

   \VerbatimInput[firstline=5,lastline=5]{test.txt}

starts printing at line 5, and continues to the end of
the file.

Is there a fix for this, does anyone know?

    Thanks,

Hello,

 

A colleague of mine recently introduced me to La Tex as a tool for writing
math assessments.  I am working on creating a database of math problems
(test item bank) and was wondering if La Tex might be a good tool for this
purpose.

 

I'm hoping to find a contact person that I can talk with about my project
and see if La Tex is a solution.  If so, then I'm hoping to get some
training and/or to hire a consultant to help me get started.

 

I would appreciate any leads.

 

Best Regards,

I've done similar projects and written the problems in LaTeX (no  
space, BTW).  I wouldn't use LaTeX as the database itself, but as a  
language for expressing mathematics, it's unparalleled.  I wouldn't  
dream of anything else.

Of course, you're asking a group of TeX and LaTeX users. :-)

On the database side, my advice is to look into the standards of  
learning object metadata (LOM) so that when you create your database  
you'll be able to describe it in well-recognized terms.  Then you'll  
have to create a vocabulary describing the problems and the skills  
they test--look to educational standards for this.  There's probably  
existing projects like this; see if you can find the schemas they use.

Hi Rudresh!
Using the fancyhdr package, you can define the headers and footers on
"plain" pages as well as "fancy" pages. I believe the title page defaults to
plain, but you can always force it with \thispagestyle{plain}. Check out the
documentation for fancyhdr for details.

Cheers,
Robert Wilson

I am using pdftex to generate a PDF from a plain ol' vanilla TeX file. Does
anyone have any pointers to examples to show how I can go about generating
a Table of Contents reasonably easily?

Do you mind if I ask why you aren't using LaTeX? I'm new to LaTeX and have
never used TeX, but in the former, you would just use \tableofcontents. I'm
curious as to what advantages TeX has over LaTeX.

The advantage to plain pdftex is simplicity and also flexiblity in things like 
font sizes etc.  When I am sizing a book to meet a certain page count I may 
change body font size by very small increments until it fits just right. If I 
have a very complex layout I will use Context. I'll never go back to the 
constraints and verbosity of LaTeX---but YMMD of course. 

For the specific question use 
1. \input eplain.tex

2. add the line \readtocfile up front where you need the TOC
3. Modify  your chapter etc. macros to include the line
\writetocentry{chapter}{#1}
where #1 refers to the chapter title
4. If necessary revise the TOC entry writing macros e.g., \writetocentry etc. 
to suit your purposes. 

Each time you change the source file you must run the pdftex comand twice, 
once to build a new TOC file and the second time to put the revised file into 
the document.  Since I am also doing an index usually my script may look 
something like this:
pdftex book.tex
makeindex book.idx
pdftex book.tex

I edit in gvim. I assign different functions to the F keys. F3 runs pdftex 
book.tex.  I always name my main file book.tex. Thus I can be editing away
on the preface file but hit F3 and get a compile of the whole book. F5 calls 
kpdf book.pdf. This is of Linux of course but something similar can be 
cobbled up using .bat files.

The short answer is that I find LaTeX far too constricting for most kinds
of work.

I do occasionally use LaTeX, but I always find that I end up: 1) having to
look up loads of things (probably mostly because I use LaTeX so rarely); 2)
getting frustrated because I keep wanting to change defaults. I generally
use LaTeX when I have to do deal with lots of floats (mostly tables and
figures); otherwise I find plain TeX far easier to deal with.

This is the first time I've had to put a TOC in a book for which I've used
TeX, though.

   [toc in plain tex]

There is no particular support in plain tex for making toc's.  
I'm also not aware of any independent packages for doing toc's in plain,
not that that means there aren't any.

Perhaps you'd find the intended-to-be-generic toc support in eplain to
be useful.

Hi all,

I was wondering if I could do simple time calculations from within LaTeX.
For example, 10:15-16:00 should result in 5.75, while 10:15-01:00 should
result in 14.75. I looked around CTAN, but could not find anything that
seemed to fit. On the other hand, I am rather certain there must be a way
to do this.


Thanks for all help :)

Message-ID: <004501c86a71$b4f89da0$4066fea9@h3d5g8>

2008 February 8

Hello-- I am writing you at the suggestion of Karl Berry, who has been trying to help me with my problem, which is as follows:

I work in DOS 6.22 and I have several files written in TeX which I want to convert to straight ASCII. (These files do not contain math symbols, just text stuff; they pertain to Pari/GP, and are tutorials and explanations.) I can read these files, but they contain a lot of symbols and characters which obviously don't belong in a purely ASCII text, and while I can edit them out, it's a chore, as there are a lot of 'em, and I'd rather have some software program to do the conversion (i.e., editing) for me.

I have a file called "tex2mail", which is stated to be such a conversion program, but that introduces its own problems.
In a file called README, I am told that I must convert the first line in "tex2mail" so it will show "the correct full path name of your perl executable".

I have no idea what the "correct path name" should be, nor do I have anything pertaining to "perl" (which I am told is some sort of programming language itself).

Also, the README file says that the invocation to cause the conversion to take place is:

   tex2mail [-linelength <bytesperline> ] [-debug <level> ] [-by_par] [-TeX] [-ragged] [-noindent] < foo.tex > foo.txt

in which I assume that "foo" would be replaced by the actual name of the TeX file which I want to have converted. Is that correct? I tried that, but (probably because I hadn't changed that pesky first line in any way) all I got was an error message from DOS, about a bad command.

Karl steered me to a program called "detex", which I downloaded, but when I tried it, all I got was a message stating that it won't run under DOS (which Karl warned me up front might well be the case). He suggested that I explain my problem to you and to ask if you might know of a binary (in detex, or whatever) which WOULD run in DOS and do what I want. So, I'm asking!!

Your help will be GREATLY appreciated!

Perhaps you could process the file with tex or latex, as appropriate, 
then turn the output into pdf. Then using acrobat, the text can be 
extracted. If you don't have the necessary tools in your dos 
environment, perhaps a friend running another system could help you. By 
the way, this extraction path may do a more faithful job than just 
working on the original tex file.

Please try this:

  \usepackage{ifthen}
  \usepackage{calc}

  \newcounter{bh}
  \newcounter{bm}
  \newcounter{eh}
  \newcounter{em}
  \newcounter{dh}

  \newcounter{hrdec}


  \def\timediff#1:#2-#3:#4 {%
   \setcounter{bh}{#1}
   \setcounter{bm}{#2}
   \setcounter{eh}{#3}
   \setcounter{em}{#4}
   \ifthenelse{\value{eh}>\value{bh}\and\value{em}>\value{bm}}
     {\setcounter{dh}{\value{eh}-\value{bh}}
      \setcounter{dm}{\value{em}-\value{bm}}}
     {\ifthenelse{\value{eh}>\value{bh}\and\value{em}<\value{bm}}
       {\setcounter{dh}{\value{eh}-\value{bh}-1}
        \setcounter{dm}{60+\value{em}-\value{bm}}}
       {\ifthenelse{\value{eh}<\value{bh}\and\value{em}>\value{bm}}
        {\setcounter{dh}{24+\value{eh}-\value{bh}}
         \setcounter{dm}{\value{em}-\value{bm}}}
        {\ifthenelse{\value{eh}<\value{bh}\and\value{em}<\value{bm}}
        {\setcounter{dh}{23+\value{eh}-\value{bh}}
         \setcounter{dm}{60+\value{em}-\value{bm}}}}}{}}
    \setcounter{hrdec}{\value{dm}*5/3}
    \thedh.\thehrdec}



Then \timediff10:15-16:00 gives 5.75 and \timediff10:15-01:00 gives 14.75.

Nice solution :-)  It may be worth clarifying,
though, whether 10:15-11:20 should yield 1.5
or 1.05.

Uh.. this is one of the situations where I can just say 'Wow, thanks!'. That's
a huge lot more than I even dared to expect!

The function I want to put this into (\Fee from the invoice package), is failing
no matter if I try to put \timediff10:15-16:00 into it directly:

                     \let
  l.47 ...cd.de}     {12.5}   {\timediff10:15-16:00}

try to put it into a variable with
  \newcounter{X}
  \setcounter{X}{\timediff10:15-16:00}

                     \let
  l.40 \setcounter{X}{\timediff10:15-16:00}

so I am assuming there is some magic escape I need to cast a function
call into a variable? I am looking around the web to find out, atm. :)

If anyone wants to look at the source, I included a basic example mixed
of the invoice package & your function.


Again, thanks!
Richard

In my case, I would want that to result in 1.08, 5 minutes being
a 1/12th of an hour. Though testing just this case, I found a bug or
two in the function above. I will reply to the mail by E. Krishnan for
that, though.

I found two issues with the function, one of which I could fix :)

You need to reinitialize dh, dm, hrdec for the function to give the correct
result when called more than once in a tex file.

 \setcounter{dh}{0}
 \setcounter{dm}{0}
 \setcounter{hrdec}{0}

does the trick.

The other issue is that when the minute or hour values are equal, you
get a null result, no matter what the other parameter is. It seems there
is not handling for the minutes being equal in the code, so I am trying to
make this fly, atm.


Thanks again,
Richard

Oops! Sort of overlooked that case. Here's the modification to take care

I realized that this was because the second test case used 00 minutes, both
times. Now that the values are re-set every time, the initialization is not
needed, any more. Sorry for the false lead.

Cool, thanks. There is one last issue, which does not hurt me, but if you
plan to put this somewhere (and you probably should. CTAN?), it should
probably be addressed:

  \timediff10:15-11:20

results in 1.8, presumably because this is not a real float, but two integers
concat'ed with a dot in between. LaTeX probably eats the leading zeros as
it (normally) should.


Last but not least, do you know how I could make the other function
[the output of] your function as input? There must be some way, but I can't
find it :/


Thanks a lot!

Second oops! (seems to be a day of botch-ups). You want the time to be 
expressed as a decimal and I thought multiplying by the minutes 5/3 would 
do the trick; but that does works only for minutes difference greater than

Perfect, thanks :) Now you only need to put it on CTAN for others to enjoy,

Do you have any idea about my second question? If not, that's cool too, just

Perl is a scripting language which would need to be installed on your  
system before you can run the program. The path name would point to  
where on your computer the program that runs the perl language is  
installed. That is what they mean about the "perl executable". Perl  
quite large and there are a number of settings that need to be set  
properly before it will work so you may not want to be bothered unless  
there is no other way, otherwise it looks like this may do what you  
want.

I would think that first you need to cd to the directory where your  
tex file is and then run:
C:/../tex2mail -TeX foo.tex

where the .. indicates the path to where the tex2mail file is stored,  
or you could copy it into the same folder as the tex files.

You are correct in your assumption about the "foo.tex" file name and  
your own. In theory it should also accept *.tex if all your tex files  
are in the same directory and if you wanted to process them all at the  
same time.

detex is good but there a few issues with some LaTeX environments from  
what I recall.

Had a quick look at the detex folder and you need to compile the  
source code. This may be a good thing if you have a compiler on your  
system. This page:
http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/handouts/cstepbystep/sx3c.html : has  
a nice simple explanation of the steps.

Here is a list of places that seem to have free compilers if you need  
them
http://gcc.gnu.org/ (preferred)
http://www.openwatcom.org/
http://www.digitalmars.com/

I hope this is what you were looking for.

Cheers

There are still a couple of problems with your script as I see it:

1. It doesn't round off properly it only truncates (which may, of course,
actually be desired).
2. It adds spurious space and needs a few percent symbols at line endings.

Also the requirement of a space following the arguments easily leads to
errors.

Finally, there's a certain amount of overkill here - compare the following
two versions (the third time difference is 0.966, which should round of to
0.97):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{calc}
\newcounter{dh}
\newcounter{dm}
\newcounter{em}
\def\TimeDiffTrunc(#1:#2-#3:#4){%

Subject: [texhax] Spacing in \[\] environment
Message-ID: <00ed01c86c06$0b2cd430$4301a8c0@flaptop>

Hey all,

two spacing issues that are annoying me...

* The vertical space beneath the maths environment seems way to small to
me. A suitable amount of vertical space is placed above the maths
environment, about one line's worth, but below, hardly any space is
inserted. Is there some way to change this globally?

* Within the maths environment itself, horizontal space is inserted
around an array environment. Contrast this example, where there is no
space between the outer curly braces and the inner ordered pair...

\[
\{(\mathsf{FORM.page},)\}
\]

...with this example, where a considerable amount of space is inserted
between outer braces and inner ordered pair:

\[
\{\begin{array}{l}(\mathsf{FORM.page},)\end{array}\}
\]

Obviously in the real document the array environment contains more than
one row but in the interests of brevity I've taken out all but the
first, and shorted that one.

Both these issues seem to do with spacing around environments, rather
than within them, and so I remain defeated. Previously I'd have
liberally added negative \vspace's in the first instance and \!'s in the
second, but now I want global solutions, since the amount of maths is
considerable.

A jam bun for anyone who can help me out with these issues.

Regards,

James

Subject: [texhax] Raggedright in fixed-width table column
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0802110104240.5535@plaza.301south.net>

Hello all,

I am trying to construct a table that looks like this:

\begin{tabular}{l p{10cm}}
...

and then define the entries in the table using this command:

\newcommand{\tableentry}[2]{%
#1 & #2 \\
}

except I would like the text in the 10cm parbox to be raggedright, rather 
than justified.

The only way I have found to do this is in the actual use of the 
\tableentry command:

\tableentry{column 1 text}{\raggedright column 2 text...}

except it seems like I should be able to do this without entering 
\raggedright in every single \tableentry argument.  I would like to 
specify \raggedright in the definition of \tableentry instead of having to 
repeatedly specify it on every invocation.

I have tried:

\newcommand{\tableentry}[2]{%
#1 & {\raggedright #2} \\
}

as well as other variations like \raggedright{#2} and {\raggedright{#2}} 
but none of these achieve the desired result.

Does my question make sense? Is there a solution?

Thanks in advance,
Brandon

fmtutil --byfmt latex

Am I best to start over again ?  I have spent hours and hours on this.

This topic has already been discussed on comp.tex.tex, in a thread started
on 3rd Feb.
    <http://groups.google.co.uk/group/comp.text.tex/msg/3b79cc8ec2ec09c6>

I suggest that this discussion more to c.t.t., and that the two threads be
merged.

Unless the google interface deceives me, the other thread is dead,
though?

I tried to modify the invoice package[1], but I could not make it fly. If
anyone is able to prod me in the right direction..?

As a side note, I tried

 \edef\foo{{ab.cd.de}{12.5}{\timediff10:15-16:00}} \expandafter\Fee\foo

as well, but that did not work, either :/

The parameters are \belowdisplayskip and \belowdisplayshortskip.  They should
be equal and equal to \abovedisplayskip (\abovedisplayshortskip should be smaller).

Since they are normally set equal, you must be doing something to change
that.  Either you have set the parameters somewhere, or you are fiddling
with white space in the document.

My cloudy crystal ball says you may be leaving a blank line before the
\[, which causes a blank paragraph line to occur.

No it isn't.  The space is the "\arraycolsep" around the outermost columns.
Try \begin{array}{{}ccc{}}

Sorry, I meant to type \begin{array}{@{}ccc@{}}

(Look up the feature of @{} insertions suppressing the

There is not attached file, 'only' the macro definitions in your mail.

I'd sent the mail from my college and it seems the attachment didn't go 
through. So, here's the attachment.

Hi,
if it's supposed to be a LaTeX package (and it's actually coded in
LaTeX), maybe a LaTeX-like syntax would be fine.  What I mean is to
put the argument into braces:

  \timediff{10:15-11:20}

This is a little bit of extra work, but I'm sure that LaTeX users
honor it.

Just a suggestion.

Regards,
  Reinhard

There are two solutions, both using the "array" package.

1. \usepackage{array}

    \newcommand{\tableentry}[2]{#1 & #2 \\}
    \newcolumntype{P}[1]{>{#1\arraybackslash}p{10cm}}
    \begin{tabular}{lP{\raggedright}}


2. \usepackage{array}

    \newcommand{\tableentry}[2]{#1 & #2 \tabularnewline}
    \begin{tabular}{l>{\raggedright}p{10cm}}

Thanks :)
That solution does not seem to allow for repeated calling of the macro &
using its return value, though?

Or maybe I am just too tired, atm (can well be possible..)

Message-ID: <c601f8ee0802111024o4b644105q2131c0fe101a6586@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

 Just a quick question on the compatibility of TeX. I understand the primary
output of the SW is in PDF or DIV format, with the possibility of getting
other formats like HTML, RTF, and more. I was also told about other tools
that convert TeX to word docs, however, from what I've seen so far I
wouldn't be able to edit the math formulae in MS Word.

I will be preparing some course notes that include many Math equations, so I
wanted to use TeX for it's easy of dealing with equations but at the same
time make the notes available in (editable) MS Word format for my colleages
who would like to review/edit these notes but do not use TeX.

Your help is appreciated.

    I have spent hours and hours on this.

Sorry to hear it.

    Am I best to start over again ?  

If you installed it and accepted the defaults, then installing it again
and accepting the defaults again probably won't change anything :).

    set reports:

    TEXDIR=/usr/local/texlive/2007
    TEXINPUTS=
    TEXMFHOME=/u/usr/joe/texmf
    TEXMFLOCAL=/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
    TEXMFSYSVAR=/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-var

That empty TEXINPUTS looks wrong.  I advise unsetting all these
TeX-related envvars and rerunning this command:

    fmtutil --byfmt latex 

If it still fails, then please send the output you get from running it,
with all error and other messages.

Best,

The "fp" package gives a neat solution to your problem

   \usepackage{fp}

   \def\timediffcalc(#1:#2-#3:#4){%
     \FPeval\btm{#1 * 60 + #2}
     \FPeval\etm{#3 * 60 + #4}
     \FPeval\adtm{\etm - \btm}
     \FPeval\cdtm{1440 + \etm - \btm}
     \FPifpos\adtm
       \FPset\dtm{\adtm}
     \else
       \FPset\dtm{\cdtm}
     \fi
     \FPeval\dth{\dtm / 60}
     \FPtrunc\dthtrunc\dth2}

   \def\timediffprn(#1:#2-#3:#4){%
    \timediffcalc(#1:#2-#3:#4)
    \dthtrunc\relax}

   \def\timediffnum{\dthtrunc}


Then

   \timediffprn(10:15-16:00)

prints 5.75 and

   \timediffprn(10:15-01:00)

prints 14.75. To use the time difference as a number for further  
computations, use the commands

   \timediffcalc

and

   \timediffnum

in tandem as in the attached file. (Not a very elegant solution and I  
will try to modify them later).

in my view best for equations, and gives nice output, if correctly

the short answer is that it's not convenient enough for you and your 
colleagues to exchange Word files for TeX processing.  

This is a FAQ - or at least the question is asked repeatedly

see e.g. "microsoft word" in 

Mailing list archives: http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/

the actual FAQ does not seem to relevantly mention microsoft word 

TeX FAQ: http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq

the TUG website 

 http://tug.org/begin.html

has lots of helpful links including 

http://www.rna.nl/tex-newbie.html  

which tries to state with a similie why MS Word and TeX don't 
interact conveniently.

I'm surprised that there is so little mention of the worlds most 
widely distributed and used wordprocessor family. ( I shrink, 
deliberately, from saying "popular")  I think that it may be because 
any discussion of people's favourite text editing tool is likely to 
produce "flames" - statements with more heat (strength of feeling) 
than light (clarity, enlightenment). 

Positively - what working methods might work for you and your 
colleagues?

They could annotate paper or PDF files if equipped appropriately 
(pencil, Adobe Acrobat) You'd then be merging in the amemdments they 
proposed. 

If colleagues are supplying whole chapters, you could look at whether 
it was convenient to give the publisher final copy in PDF format, 
your parts with equations & TeX,  their parts in Word with no, or 
very few equations.  I foresee that it will be difficult to achieve 
the same book design in the two systems. And that the index and cross 
references  that span chapters will not be automatic.  So there would 
be compromises needed depending on what you want to do.

There may be methods of converting MSWord XML format to open document 
format and from there to TeX, but I suspect that repeatedly 
exchanging documents that have been through multiple conversions on 
each exchange will be inconvenient because the translations may not 
be perfect.  

Machine translation of idioms gives the flavour -- "the spirit is 
willing but the flesh is weak"  as translated into Russian  and back 
out returns as "The whisky is excellent but the meat is rotten" - 
this is alleged to have been from a program called Systran.

I hesitate to suggest it, because it will give  low quality 
typesetting, but if you were working just in Word
you  make each equation into a tiny picture  and wordprocess 
everything else.

TeX could typeset the equations for you and you could extract the 
images - e.g. from an experimental  TeX server  like the one at the 
Open University

http://mathtran.open.ac.uk/

whether .png images integrate well into Word, I don't know, and I 
don't know whether you'd get an adequate result for your publisher. 
Ask him or her.

So I'm not optimistic about your finding a convenient way of using 
TeX and Word together.

But perhaps other list users have  positive suggestions?

Subject: [texhax] single commands to start and end superscript
Message-ID: <20080212150134.GA15056@eureca.de>

Greetings,

I would like to change an existing macro in a LaTeX document. Said macro
parses a sequence of characters, outputting them one by one, changing fonts
or substituting symbols when encountering special characters.

What I would like to add is a 'switch to superscript' and a 'leave
superscript' character. Thus, I need single commands for those two actions.

I do not know enough of the bare bones to come up with those, so any help
would be appreciated.

You *can* take an existing PostScript font, and define a
modified variant of it which is condensed (i.e. narrower)
or expanded (wider).

To do this, you install your modified font as a new one,
with two crucial changes:

1. When you run afm2tfm to produce the TeX font metric
    for your new file, specify argument -e 0.6 (to condense
    each character to 60% of its normal width).

2. In the .map file, specify the same value, followed by "ExtendFont".
    E.g. for a condensed version of OCR-B, we created
    the file pob.map, containing the single line:

	pobr OCRB  " TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont 0.6 ExtendFont " <8r.enc <ob______.pfb

    (We used OCRB because it was the only not-part-of-a-distribution
    PostScript font that was to hand, so we could be sure it didn't
    interfere with anything else.)

(You can also slant an existing font -- by using SlantFont instead of
ExtendFont -- though that wasn't relevant for us.)

For full details of how to install a new PostScript font, see:

	See section "6 PostScript fonts" for a good overview

Donald, hi,

great, thank you!The additional vertical space around \[\] was indeed a
paragraph separator, and the @{} solves the array spacing. Thanks again.

Best,

Dear Ahmed,

I had to fiddle around a lot with TeX<-->MS Word conversion. However, it 
is a quite painful act and most of the time you will be happy if you are 
able to convert the text with a minimum of text-highlighting (italic, 
bold, superscript, etc.) I never were able to convert math-equation in 
an editable format. Thanks M$ for not showing us how they read and 
control there doc-format.

However, there might be some roundabouts which might help you out.
First of all there are tools which create a picture of the equation and 
this can be placed in the MSWord document. This is for sure not editable 
anymore.

There is another free tool as well which is called TeXaide (Windows 
only) [1].
As far as I can remember with this tool you can create equations (in a 
GUI-style manner, good for your colleagues, bad for you), convert this 
to LaTeX code for yourself and in addition this tool provides 
OLE-objects to paste the equations in programs like MS-Word. If I 
remember correctly, at least for the Latex-Code there is a comment which 
includes the complete OLE-string thus you can easily copy this back to 
the program and edit the equation. For MS-Word, OLE-Objects mostly can 
be open and edited by double-click on the equation itself.

However, you and your colleagues are forced to use this little program. 
And you cannot really synchronise all changes ....


Maybe this helps a bit

Greetings

Torsten

Maybe using the Aurora plugin in Word is an acceptable 
compromize? <http://elevatorlady.ca/>. It allows you to type in 
equations using LaTeX syntax while your colleages can view and 
edit the document in the Word GUI.

The subject sums up the task, not sure why I cannot find
anything on the topic searching for embed* and page*

I'd like to use pdflatex generate stand alone formulas
and tables, ie without page layout. these will be used
in web pages and/or word processors; final output
needs be in eps or png format. Doesn't really matter
if pdflatex output is converted to eps/png or if they
are generated directly, but how can I make stand alone
images (eg size of the table/formula) vs typeset into
the paper size?

The listings env looks particularly appropriate, I'll try
that straight away next time, but in the interest of
wrapping up the doc, I just made the Verbatim text black
and the problems went away.

Dear George,

You might want to take a look at the preview package to extract  
encapsulated images of environments.

If you're looking for automated latex to HTML or MS Word conversion,  
there are a lot of solutions out there (albeit some solutions are  
partial).  See:

Dear Tom,

There is a very basic LaTeX wiki (not a wiki about LaTeX, but a wiki  
in LaTeX) at

http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/undergraduate/projects/erikmcclements/

It doesn't seem like it's had much activity lately.

George,

There are lots of things that do the equivalent to translate documents,
including latex2html, latex2rtf, etc., and I seem to recall a similar
query a year or 10 ago here, so you might search through the archives.

I'll offer a simple solution, which is to use pdfcrop to crop the pdf.
Here's an example:

\documentclass{article}
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}
\[ E=mc^2\]
\end{document}

pdflatex this, then run the result through pdfcrop. That will generate
the attached, which is what I interpret your posting to say you want.
You can then convert this to eps or png.

Alternatively, latex the above file, dvips the result, then run the ps
file through eps2eps, which will generate an eps cropped to the equation
(result attached).

It would be relatively easy to write a script to do this automatically,
I suspect, on a *nix machine, which is what I use. If you're doing this
under windows, you'll need to get advice from someone else.

HTH

In TeX i can use \hline={...} function.
Unfortunately when i'm using it in LaTeX it does't
understand it at all. The Question is ... how can i
define my own headline ? :)

regards
Lukas

See if this helps

Otherwise, you have to look for the headings definitions in the class  
you're using and change it.

But you're really missing simplicity by not wanting to use external  
packages ---fancyhdr, for example. In your terminal (or, if Windows,  
at the command prompt) type

texdoc fancyhdr

and hit return.

I am attempting to install amsfonts in maemotex distribution for the

works fine; I have copied the fonts tmf and pfb files to the
appropriate subdirectories of the texmf/fonts/ams/ directory and run
texhash. However the fonts are not visible as I keep the error

!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file msam10.pfb): cannot open Type 1 font

I have also tried to fiddle with adding the map file using updmap but
did not get anywhere ... I am not sure if the distribution has all
utilities needed to add new fonts ( the list of maemotex distribution 
files can be found at 
https://haspe.homeip.net/projekte/ddi/browser/tex/maemotex/maemotex-source-lsR

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I've recently downloaded 2.7, deleted 2.4, then installed MikTeX 2.7 for 
"everybody on the machine". The settings dialogue shows potential texmf 
roots in individual users' local documents and settings (though I don't 
see the directories). There are comments that say not to modify these 
directories since MikTeX might do so.

I want to add an addition root to hold a few home-brewed sty files. It 
is not clear from the documentation whether, if I do, I must add a new 
root per user or whether an addition is for all users. Some clarifying 
explanation of the philosophy would be useful.

You're completely right! That's the best way to approach (La)TeX!

In http://www.tug.org/begin.html look for ``TeX by Topic'' and ``TeX  
for the Impatient''. When you want to buy some books, besides,  
obviously, ``The TeXbook'', there is ``A Beginner's Book of TeX'', by  
Raymond Seroul and Silvio Levy.

Now ---about LaTeX, I think the best you can do is to study the code  
in the class you're using.

Congratulations and best regards,

Axel

Hi!

I have problems with my following macro in plain TeX

\def\mailto#1{
  \special{html:<a href="mailto:#1">}%
          {\tt #1}
  \special{html:</a>}
	 }

which creates a hyperlink for mailing in the final PDF
file. For standard emails with letters and '@' it works
fine. However such things as

  \mailto{test_user at yahoo.com}

creates an error requiring math mode for '_'.  Defining

  \catcode`\_=11
  
outside the macro fixes this (but affects the entire file).

But I would like to use this within the macro having limited
scope. However, putting \catcode... into the macro doesn't
seem to have any effect.

How can I use \catcode inside the macro definition?

Many thanks for any suggestion.
Best, Mike

If my understanding of TeX internals is right, then if the macro has one 
argument, by the time it is executed the argument has already been read, 
and thus changing catcodes will not help. So it is necessary to change 
catcode and then read the argument. This requires a macro with no 
arguments that changes the catcode and calls another one that will 
actually fetch the argument and do something useful with it.

Unfortunately I cannot provide actual code, we will have to wait for a 
TeX wizard for further help.

\catcode`\_=12
\def\mailto{\catcode`\_=12\relax\@mailto}

\def\@mailto#1{
  \special{html:<a href="mailto:#1">}%
          {\tt #1}
  \special{html:</a>}
  \catcode`\_=8\relax}
\catcode`\_=8

$$ a_1 $$

\mailto{test_user at yahoo.com}

$$ a_2 $$
\end


\mailto changes the catcode and calls \@mailto, which takes the
argument. \@mailto also has to restore the catcode.

The catcode of _ has be be set to 12 while the macro is read and has
to be restored later.  This is not necessary if you replace `\_ by the
ASCII character number, for instance \catcode95=12.

Dear Reinhard,

many thanks for your speedy reply for the \mailto which now works
perfectly!

I was trying to use the same logic to add another special macro to
my style file, e.g. altogether the code would have

\catcode`\_=12
\def\mailto{\catcode`\_=12\relax\@mailto}
\def\@mailto#1{
  \special{html:<a href="mailto:#1">}%
          {\tt #1}
  \special{html:</a>}
  \catcode`\_=8\relax
  }
\catcode`\_=8

\catcode`\~=12
\def\href{\catcode`\~=12\relax\@href}
\def\@href#1#2{
  \special{html:<a href="#1">}%
          {\tt #2}
  \special{html:</a>}
  \catcode`\~=13\relax
}
\catcode`\~13

For \href the only difference is that I used catcode assignment 13
to mark the '~' active at the end. Unfortunately I get the following
error log:

! Use of \@ doesn't match its definition.
\mailto ->\catcode `\_=12\relax \@m
                                   ailto
l.12 \mailto
            {test_user at yahoo.com}

What I am doing wrong? I don't see where I redefine '\@'...

Best, Mike

 Is there a way to do this?

 I am attaching one short paper excerpt as an example.  I would like

  Title Page

   Paper 1 with maketitle, centered

   Paper 3....
    etc.

Use the Combine documentclass from CTAN, or make .pdfs and concatenate

It was only working by coincidence (see below).

> \def\@mailto#1{

Note that in plain TeX, catcode of @ is 12, which means it is not a
valid character in multi-letter command names.  It can only be used
for a single-letter command (\@), and that's exactly what the above
\def defines.  If you put \show\@ after the definition, you'll see:

  > \@=macro:
  mailto#1-> \special {html:<a href="mailto:#1">}{\tt #1} \special {html:</a>} \c
  atcode `\_=8\relax .
  l.9 \show\@

That is, \@ is a macro taking one argument which should be preceded
("delimited on the left") with letters m-a-i-l-t-o.  And this was
perfectly fine until you redefined it here:

> \def\@href#1#2{

Now, \@ is a macro taking two arguments which should be preceded with
letters h-r-e-f, so when we say \@mailto, TeX complains because it
cannot find href following \@.

So, why use @ in macro names?  That's the common trick to make
"hidden" macros, which can't be called by the end user.  For this to
work, you have to temporarily change catcode of @ to 11 ("letter") so
that you can use it to define your hidden macros (this is the part
Reinhard omitted), and when you are done, change the catcode back to
12, to prevent users from calling hidden macros.  Something like:

  \catcode`@=11
  \def\@mailto#1{...}
  <other definitions of (or calling the) hidden macros>
  \catcode`@=12

  <user space>

HTH,
Oleg

They probably don't exist in plain TeX, but maybe it's worth adding that 
in LaTeX packages these specific catcode changes should always be 
performed using the \makeatletter and \makeatother macros:

    \makeatletter
    \def\@mailto#1{...}
    <other definitions of (or calling the) hidden macros>
    \makeatother

Subject: [texhax] two bibtex problems, one involving babel[latin]
Message-ID: <FC38D82C-0EF7-4650-B1DE-2673F8DC1F31@tufts.edu>

I am having two problems with bibtex, and hope someone can advise me.

1. I recently added a book reference to my bib file on a long  
project, and somehow bibtex refuses to see it.  I have created a test  
file and a bib file containing only this single entry.  Here they are:
??
No matter how often I tex or bibtex, it finds the citation undefined  
and bibtex can't find it in the database.  Here are the other  
auxilliary files for this:
????

2. I have several references to titles in foreign languages, and have  
used the \foreignlanguage command in these references.  The ones in  
german, french and italian create no problems, but the latin ones do:  
I get warnings that certain symbols are not valid in latin;  I  
presume these are symbols in the rest of the bib file.  Or perhaps  
this is another bug in the latin files for babel (there was an  
earlier one which was causing havoc with my texing until I replaced  
the file with a corrected update).
Here are the relevant source and bib files; again, I have isolated  
the problematic stuff in small test files:
??
The auxilliary files for these (after a number of runs through tex  
and bibtex) are
????


Any help with either problem would be appreciated.

Well, you *cite* ``Ferraro'' in bibtextest1.tex, and yet you have the  
*key* in calculus1.bib
equal to ``Ferraro:series''.  As my late Uncle Stanley would've said  
``What the hell do you expect?'' :-)

Either change the citation to ``\cite{Ferraro:series}'' or the key to  
``Ferraro'' (``@book{Ferraro,'')
and all will be well.

Haven't thought about your second problem.  I think it's beyond my  
realm of competence.

BibTeX sees it, but you aren't referring to it. You \cite{Ferraro} in  
the doc, but have Ferraro:series in the bib file. They must match.

Subject: [texhax] Heading question
Message-ID: <47C43ECE.6080107@gmail.com>

I am trying to do the following, but I can't figure out how to implement it :-(

1. I have a book in which the chapters have titles.
2. On even-numbered pages, the headline should always be the title of the book.
3. On odd-numbered pages, the headline should be the title of the current
chapter EXCEPT that if a new chapter starts on that page, the headline
should be empty.

I can easily do everything except that I haven't been able to find a trick
that will cause the headline to be empty when a new chapter starts on an
odd page.

The closest I have come is to include:
  \mark{<chapter name>}
in the macro that is called to start a new chapter,
and then to have:

\headline={\ifnum\count0>1 {\ifodd\count0 \hss \it \ifx\topmark\botmark
\else \topmark \fi \hss \else \hss \it <book name> \hss\fi}\fi}

but the \ifx always calls the false branch -- probably I am
misunderstanding something about what gets expanded when \ifx is called
(basically, I'm trying to compare two strings for equality, but I haven't
been able to find anywhere in the TeXbook where it describes how to do that
[which seems odd]).

I've spent a couple of hours messing with this and am now out of ideas, so
any suggestions would be very appreciated.

Seeing no response, I've just spent another hour on this, trying variations
on the above theme, and it's now clear that I'm not understanding something
basic.

If I make the \ifx test so that it reads:
  \ifx a a S \else D
it still chooses the false branch every time (i.e., prints "D"); my poor
little brain says that "S" should be printed every time instead. Can
someone please put me out of my misery?

You obviously compare the letter "a" with a space token.

Try

   \ifx a a \message{S} \else \message{D} \fi\end

and
   
   \ifx aa \message{S} \else \message{D} \fi\end

Yes. \ifx expands nothing (besides itself:-) but compares the
meaning of the next two tokens. \topmark does not have the same
meaning as \botmark; they are different tokens.  You are 
thinking of them as macros, but they are built-in tokens.
Verify by \show.

An analogous mistake would be:

\parskip=15pt
\baselineskip=15pt
\ifx\parskip\baselineskip


Anyway, I don't think even the intent makes much sense.
Rather, I'd suggest

\newif\ifspecialpage

Then in your \chapter macro(s)

\vfill\supereject
\global\specialpagetrue
\ifodd\pageno\else
 \null \vfill \eject \global\specialpagetrue
\fi

and your headline tests \ifspecialpage, and also performs
\global\specialpagefalse.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0802270742120.15238@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

It seems that the latest version of Miktex's viewer (the one that comes 
with Miktex 2.7) can now handle graphics things like \rotate.  It does 
this by entering something called dvips mode. Presumably this means it 
runs dvips on the fly and then displays it.  (The installation 
automatically installs ghostscript.)

Can anyone tell me whether other recent previewers are doing the same? 
I ask this in order to know what to tell users of an online journal site 
that I do the tex editing for.  We had previously not even posted the dvi 
files of papers that used things like \rotate, but now we should change 
the policy.  But I wish to inform the users what will and will not work.

OK; I think I understand that.

I don't understand why you say that.

The intent is:
  if the value of \topmark is the same as the value \botmark:
     then this must be a new chapter, so don't print anything;

OK; to me, when I first started trying to implement a solution to my
problem, it seemed like an inelegant approach to tag just the pages where
chapters began, and then check to see whether a tag was present whenever a
page was output; it seemed much more elegant to process every page the same
and compare marks. But you are right that your approach has the great merit
that it actually works.

I do wonder about how one is supposed to compare the values of \topmark,
\firstmark and \botmark, though. There has to be an easy way to do it, but
I haven't been able to find any way that works.

If I understand you correctly, the answer to your question is in the
(freely available on CTAN) file gentle.tex.

Would you care to be more specific? That's a 97-page document.

A search for "\output" showed no occurrences. Ditto a search for "\mark".
And one for \head came up with only a very elementary section on creating
headlines.

Well that explains that mistake I was making. Thank you. Unfortunately, it
doesn't really point the way to a solution to the problem of how to compare
the contents of \topmark with the contents of \botmark (or \firstmark) :-(

I looked in the source code too, but I couldn't see anything obvious that

The file itself (not the output) has a few macros at the beginning. There
are some headline routines that might be useful.

Maybe I've misunderstood the question. Here's what I had in mind for you.

Define a new conditional
\newif \iftitlepage

and when you start a section use something like
\def\section#1{%
   #1 % section title printed, possible page eject and maybe other stuff
   \titlepagetrue}

For producing the correct headline use something like
\headline= 
  {\iftitlepage \hfil \global\titlepagefalse % do nothing on a title page
   \else 
         \ifodd\pageno
         %print odd headline
         \else 
         %print even headline
         \fi
   \fi} 

I'm up to my ears in stuff today, so this is untested. Nonetheless, the
main ideas should work without difficulty if my understanding of the
problem is correct.

Give it a try, and if there are problems feel free to get back to
me either off line or through this listserv.

Cheers,
Michael

OK; yes, that (I think) is the same scheme (although different code) as
Donald was suggesting: when you go to a new section, flag the page as being
special, then at the time that the page is output, check whether the page
is special.

This does definitely work (I have it working).

And please don't misunderstand: I am *very* appreciative of all the help.
But I am still wondering how one would implement what I regard as the more
elegant solution, which, pared down, becomes the question: how does one
implement a branch that depends on whether \topmark and \botmark have the
same contents?

I realise that in some sense this is a theoretical problem, since I now
have a working implementation that solves the original problem; still, it
bothers me quite a lot that I can't figure out how to do something
equivalent to:

  if (contents-of-\topmark == contents-of-\botmark)
    do this;
  else
    do that;

It seems like that should be dead easy. But since \ifx doesn't expand
\topmark and \botmark, I can't see how to do it.

Why is the top mark equal to the bot mark only there?
They are equal on every page that contains no marks, as I recall.
In fact, I would expect the chapter-start page to contain a mark.

What?!?!  Even if comapring the top vs bottom marks works,
it is terribly obscure, and very fragile to any changes to
haow yu may decide to change the marks in the future.
A clearly named flag makes a lot more sense.

You are correct; Now that I read for the fifth time what I wrote, I realize
that I meant exactly the opposite :-(

It seems to be a matter of perception, then. I suppose if you regularly use
marks then you are correct; I have never had cause to use them before (and
I can't see why one would normally want to use them except for this kind of
thing), so my approach seemed better to me.

Not really.

The current installer has an option "install symlinks" in the menu which
will create symlinks in your system directories (whatever you specify)
to the binaries within TL.  It wouldn't work to have the actual binaries
outside the TL tree, then they couldn't find their configuration files
(without a lot of additional work on your part).

We were actually going to drop this option in the new installer we are
working on, but I guess we shouldn't.

I've always used the @misc to cite a website in bibtex, but I don't think 
this is really correct: it doesn't seem to conform to APA, MLA, etc styles 
when compiled.  Is there a package that extends bibtex to take care of 
this?

I suppose that 'not really' means that it can't be done by the
installer.  This is what Michael asked for but it's quite easy to
do it manually.

Just install to /usr/local.  The binaries will be in
/usr/local/bin/sparc-solaris.  Move them to /usr/local/bin, remove the
empty directory /usr/local/bin/sparc-solaris (if you want), and
replace $SELFAUTOPARENT by $SELFAUTODIR in texmf.cnf. 

I suppose that it works.

Hmm, though I don't use this option myself I think it's a nice thing.
If you enable this option and start installation you get a running
TeX Live system when the installer is finished.  No need to edit
config files (bashrc) manually.  Quite nice for people who are not
very familiar with their operating system.

Since Norbert already provided the code it doesn't save us any time if
we drop it.  BTW, in TL-2007 the default target directory was
/usr/... but I changed it to /usr/local/... because I think it's what
most people want.

Regards,
  Reinhard
