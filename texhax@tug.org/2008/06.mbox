Subject: [texhax] MacTeX question
Message-ID: <64af9aeb0806011419n61092b28hb4ba14dea5eb5195@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I recently installed MacTeX on my MacBook running Panther, and I am having
trouble with MacTeX recognizing a new class files. I made a dummy class
"myclass.cls" and copied it to "~/Library/texmf/tex/latex" but when I try to
compile a tex file that uses "myclass" I get an error saying "LaTeX Error:
File 'myclass.cls' not found." I looked at
"/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf" and made sure that TEXMFHOME
was set to "$HOME/Libarary/texmf" and I tried using texhash, but after doing
so I still got the same error when trying to typeset my file. Why might this
be happening?

Thanks,

Will

That's weird indeed! You did everything right (as a matter of fact,  
texhash isn't necessary for anything you put into ~/Library/texmf).

Could you subscribe and post your question to the MacOSX-TeX mailing  
list?

hello,

i'd like to look my document as follows:

- 2 column article
- background color of the textarea should be green
- the rest of the page (footer, header, margins) must be white
(- if possible, there should be a light green line between the first and
second column)

how can i achieve that in latex?

Subject: [texhax] Conflict with mathtools and lucimatx
Message-ID: <84F28316-F0C1-450A-A2D9-C950B8761515@mac.com>

I'm typesetting a book using Lucida fonts (from TUG) with  
lucimatx.sty from PCTeX. I didn't install anything else from the  
PCTeX package ---that is, tfm, vf, fd, etc.--- as, from what I see,  
they are exactly the same as the ones I got from TUG.

Now ---lucimatx has worked without a problem, but now that I want to  
add mathtools.sty I get errors like

> ! Missing \endcsname inserted.

Commenting out mathtools makes everything work OK once more.

No matter the loading order, or if I put \usepackage{amsmath} or let  
mathtools load it.

This is with mathtools 2007/12/03 v1.03 (the whole mh bundle, as a  
matter of fact).

The packages I use (in loading order):

\usepackage[10pt]{type1ec}
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
\usepackage[greek,german,french,english,spanish]{babel}%
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}%
\usepackage{textcomp}%
\usepackage{amsmath}%
\usepackage{mathtools}
\usepackage[lucidasmallscale=true]{lucimatx}
\usepackage{bm}
\usepackage[expansion=false,protrusion=true,factor=1350]{microtype}
\usepackage[percent]{overpic}
\usepackage{calc}
\usepackage{verse}
\usepackage{xfrac} %%% <- Yes, I got template.sty, etc., the correct
\UseCollection{xfrac}{plainmath} %% versions; not the ones in TeXLive
\usepackage{floatpag}
\usepackage{color}
\usepackage[round]{natbib}
\usepackage{manyfoot}
\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{multicol}

It's not a conflict with lucimatx ---typesetting with CM produces the  
same error. Eliminating labels in equations doesn't work either --- 
mathtools then chokes with a tabbing environment. Commenting out  
xfrac and

\newcommand\sfrac[2]{\ensuremath{\frac{#1}{#2}}}

again doesn't work, but I can't find where the problem is. I tried  
also with mathtools 2004/10/10 v1.01a (TeXLive 2007) without luck.

Any ideas?

Best,

Axel

Send a minimal example to the author (me) but at mh.ctan at gmail.com.

My gut feeling is that it may be resolved if you load mathtools before
loading babel with the french option.

That's it! Thank you!

I didn't use to load any package before babel. I did it with  
\usepackage[10pt]{type1ec} because those are the specific  
instructions, and then I thought to do the same with fixltx2e.

Now ---taking advantage of your generosity: as mathtools  
\RequirePackage{amsmath}, do I need to load amsmath or can I just  
load mathtools?

Best,

Axel

What about lagrind? http://www.ifi.uio.no/it/latex-links/lgrind.pdf

It has given me some problems with indents in the past, particularly comments, 
but that's often down to how my text editor represents the indents.

You're welcome.

The problem is the definition of centercolon feature. Getting babels
active characters to play nicely with the same characters being
math-active only can be troublesome. By loading mathtools first babel
just overwrites whatever mathtools did to the colon and the problem is
gone. Of course, it means you can't use the feature...

When I find a good solution for breqn (where all math symbols and
characters are macros in math mode), I'll adopt it for mathtools as
well.

It loads amsmath automatically and will take amsmath options as well.

Thank you again. I'm just finishing fine-tuning xfrac (another  
creation of yours, which I think should be generally available, but  
ancillary packages in TeXLive are outdated) for Lucida. Not orthodox,  
I know, but I've decided to use textfractionsolidus in math mode as  
well.

Best,

You could try the \verbatiminput{} command, from the verbatim package.

If you have found many alternatives and you are asking for which is best, 
I can't help. Otherwise you could have a look at the Topic version of the TeX Catalogue:

    http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#cs

or enter "literate programming" or "listings" in the third field ("package informations") of

    http://ctan.tug.org/search.html

listings and highlight may be most renowned and useful, according to what I have seen 
in studying certain parts of CTAN recently, but I have never used such a package myself.

Paul, hey,

if you find the 'listings' package too feature rich, as I did, try this
'myverbatim' package, which does for me. It just uses the 'fancyvrb'
package a puts a frame around the resulting code. It also utilises the
invaluable 'upquote' package.

Hope this helps.

at least for _you_

_that_ simplicity is not so easy. Distributing _one_ pdfTeX (binary!) 
(and TeX installation) with your program would not be very platform-independant. 
However, your program would just do what TeX shells (WinShell for Windows, 
e.g.) do. So just look at some of them to see what you have to do. 
"WinShell for Windows" tells you that TeX shells are "platform-independant" 
to a limited extent (in general). Now, that WinShell (which I know best) 
is based on installing a TeX system (e.g., MiKTeX for Windows) first and then, 
in installing the shell, provide it with the command lines, paths, ... 
appropriate for that TeX system. Your program would need just an 
installation procedure like this. This is not a real problem, is business as usual, 
I just wanted to tell you that you were dreaming.

Or you would have to distribute TeX installations, one for each platform ...!? 

> The program is going to be open source, licenced (most probably) under
> GNU/GPL v3 and it's going to be written in C++. 

... license problems (maybe there are only commercial TeX installations for 
certain platforms [Apple MacIntosh!? "Textures"]), and you can't really be 
sure that they suffice, depending on which version of a platform the end-user 
has, or even on his hardware. You also would have to account for a latex.fmt 
or so whose versions can differ much, e.g.: differing sizes of certain memory 
regions which may result in "TeX capacity exceeded" with your program. 
Your program might need to include a procedure to generate an .fmt 
that is appropriate for the requirements of your program. 

Two extreme alternatives. Note, I have never attended a course on 
programming, TeX is the only programming language which I can produce 
something of use with. I just have been thinking on certain things I have 
mused about recent months and studied CTAN for. 

1. At least in theory, you can do anything with TeX macros that you can 
do with any other programming language, see 

    http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#calculating
    http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#cs

(a BASIC interpreter, e.g. I see there it is said about c2latex it could 
translate C Code into LaTeX code, which I don't believe after reading 
descriptions of c2latex elsewhere.) What you find there seems to be 
only something like fun or sports so far; I would like to know whether, 
e.g., _you_ could implement your program by TeX macros instead of C, 
and how long the end-user would have to wait for the the end of one 
TeX run, as compared with a binary implementation of your program. 

One very important merit of this approach would be that you could 
rely on TeX's impressive portability. Your "program" could be run 
wherever there is a TeX installation, without any C compiler. 

This idea indeed gave rise to the docstrip TeX package which is standard 
for installing LaTeX packages and typeset their documentation; 
and thus it is an example of a really very _useful_ TeX package replacing 
some binary installation program. 

2. May be you could hardwire a TeX installation in your C code!? 
E.g., port the pdfTeX source into your code, moreover font informations 
and TeX macro packages!? If you could, you would perhaps become 
around half as famous as Donald Knuth and/or very rich ... ;-) 
Namely, building a TeX installation has long been an adventure -- 
you could read mails like "I updated my ... installation, and now 
_nothing_ works". (MiKTeX 2.7 seems to be very reliable and 
smooth nowadays.) 

Have fun, 

    Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Problem with dvips and truetype fonts
Message-ID: <20080605134929.GA24181@netsoc.tcd.ie>

Hi guys,

I'm hoping somebody can help me with the following problem. I am using a
Chinese truetype font (Simkai) in my document. I used the instructions
at http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/cs/cjk.html to install it
(replacing Bitstream by Simkai). This worked perfectly until recently.
Now (not having changed any settings, but probably having upgraded Latex
at some point; I'm running Debian Lenny/testing), I get the following
error message when I run dvips:

# dvips -E -o mozi.eps mozi.dvi -R0
This is dvips(k) 5.96.1 Copyright 2007 Radical Eye Software (www.radicaleye.com)
' TeX output 2008.06.05:1416' -> mozi.eps
dvips: ! Couldn't find header file simkai.ttf.
Note that an absolute path or a relative path with .. are denied in -R2 mode.

(The only reason I'm passing -R0 is that strange error message; I didn't
use to do that). 

Now I have no idea what this means, and why it was working before but
not anymore. When I put simkai.ttf in the current directory, it finds
it, but generates as 12MB EPS file (instead of the 77 kB file that it
used to generate) which subsequently fails to open. Obviously, it's
using simkai.ttf for something it's not supposed to, but I don't know
what's causing this.

Any suggestions would be very welcome,

Thanks,

Edsko

Hi all,

I'm a relative newcomer to LaTeX and I have a very simple question.  I 
have an article accepted to an online journal (that provides no 
typesetting help and never heard of LaTeX), and they want 1.5 inch 
margins all around.  The paper is letter size, and there are footnotes, 
which I believe must be within those margins.  No headers or page 
numbers, but I have already handled that.

What are the set of commands I need in the preamble that will accomplish 
this?

Thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <C46C696E.207B%sclaxton@scribenet.com>

To Whom It May Concern:

I am familiar with LaTeX and have used it in the past to enter data and
equations into a mathematical textbook. I have now been asked to create a
design for a book. I know this involves using classes and packages, but I am
not familiar with these. I have searched online documentation and have found
vague references to designing your own class, usually with only some caution
that it "is not a straightforward task, and is often best left to the
professionals" or "typically involves a lot of work that is essentially
programming and thus does not live easily with the declarative kind of
design specification for a document (or range of documents) that would be
produced by a professional typographic designer" or "although some
parameters can be adjusted within a predefined document layout, the design
of a whole new layout is difficult and takes a lot of time" (there's a
footnote here suggesting that this is being addressed in the LaTeX3
system?). This does not sound promising. I am a typesetter (I work in
publishing and am very familiar with Quark and InDesign) but have no
experience with design in LaTeX. Nor do I have extensive programming
experience. How difficult would it be to learn how to use classes and
packages to come up with a design? And how would I go about learning how to
do this? Any feedback or suggested resources would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Stacy, there is a ready-rolled class called Memoir that has most
of what you need for a textbook. Of course there is also the LaTeX
standard book class, but this usually needs a bit of additional
programming to make it do what you want.

I agree memoir would be a good starting point. Note that memoir has just 
been released in a new version including a revised edition of its aprox. 
500-600 page manual (which also include discussions about layout).

Hello,
I have written a big book of mathematics in Latex (obviously!). I designed the layout myself, and it was accepted by the publisher as it was.
I managed to do that using some packages which permits one to change some aspects of the default layout. 
Here is the list of these packages:
1- geometry.sty. Obviously the first one to use to change page and dimensions settings. So easy!
2- titlesec.sty. this one is very convenient to change the aspect of the sectionning commands (chaper to subparagraph!), and to create new ones. It also permits one to change the pagestyle with an very easy syntax.
3- titletoc.sty, The companion to the previous one: to change the appearance of the table of content (and other TOC that you create yourself).

OK, this is useful for "ordinary" books, which are structured in the usual way by sectionning commands... So that the amount of investment you need depends on the kind of book you have to design.

For instance, I am now designing a new layout for a technical report which need to be readable by administrators (we need to justify the money they give to us...). In this layout, I have managed to create "encarts", different colors of the layout for different chapters, etc... 

If you are interested, I can share more informations with you off-list.

In my thesis, I use

%% modified from book.cls (based on the TeXnik FAQ)
\makeatletter
\newcommand{\thebibpreamble}{}
\renewenvironment{thebibliography}[1]
     {\chapter*{\bibname}%
      \@mkboth{\MakeUppercase\bibname}{\MakeUppercase\bibname}%
    % START MOD 
    \thebibpreamble%
    \flushleft%
    % END MOD
      \list{\@biblabel{\@arabic\c at enumiv}}%
           {\settowidth\labelwidth{\@biblabel{#1}}%
            \leftmargin\labelwidth
            \advance\leftmargin\labelsep
            \@openbib at code
            \usecounter{enumiv}%
            \let\p at enumiv\@empty
            \renewcommand\theenumiv{\@arabic\c at enumiv}}%
      \sloppy
      \clubpenalty4000
      \@clubpenalty \clubpenalty
      \widowpenalty4000%
      \sfcode`\.\@m}
     {\def\@noitemerr
       {\@latex at warning{Empty `thebibliography' environment}}%
      \endlist}
\makeatother

After that, you can use 

\renewcommand{\thebibpreamble}
{
  blah
}

to insert "blah" in between the \chapter command of the bibliography and the
bibliography proper. You can probably stick in a label there, too. Note however
that you will want to change the chapter* to a chapter in the code above if you
want to refer to the chapter *number* (if you just want to refer to the page
number, you don't need to make that change).

This is a little tricky.

All I can come up with in the 2 minutes I have spare is this:

In the bst you're using look for the line that includes the preamble.  In
abbrv.bst it is

FUNCTION {begin.bib}
{ preamble$ empty$
    'skip$
    { preamble$ write$ newline$ }
  if$
  "\begin{thebibliography}{"  longest.label  * "}" * write$ newline$
}

change the ordering to have

FUNCTION {begin.bib}
{ "\begin{thebibliography}{"  longest.label  * "}" * write$ newline$
  preamble$ empty$
    'skip$
    { preamble$ write$ newline$ }
  if$
}

Save the bst file calling it something different and then put something like


@Preamble{"\label{sec:bibliography}"}

In your bib file.  It *should* work ;-)

Cheers,  Phil

Agree w/ Andy and Lars recommendation of Memoir.

The thing that I'd suggest in addition to this is that you work up  
your design as a package (so after reading an introduction to LaTeX  
(_The Not So Short Guide_ available at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/gentle/gentle.pdf) 
  and the Memoir manual you'll also want to read the class guide: http://www.latex-project.org/guides/clsguide.pdf 
  and you should probably also get _The LaTeX Companion 2nd Ed._).  
Also create a pair of packages one of which will include macros for  
all typographic tweaks, the other of which includes definitions of  
them which do nothing --- send authors the latter when returning a  
manuscript.

You'll also likely want to configure fonts, for which your best option  
is probably XeTeX (you'll be using it w/ LaTeX macros so it'll be  
xelatex) and Will Robertson's nifty FontSpec packagehttp://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texmf-dist/doc/xelatex/fontspec/ 
  though Philipp Lehman's Font Installation Guide is a wonderful  
document and essential if you'll need to use pdflatex and Type 1 fonts.

Useful links to documentation:

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0806070830320.27773@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

I have been using the Zapf Chancery fonts.  However, as supplied, they
are just too small.  So I modified the ot1pzc.fd file by adding *[1.2]
at the appropriate place.  I know I should have made a new file with the
modification in it and tried that, but I could not figure out how to get
tex to read that one instead.  At any rate, the output looks right
(perhaps 1.15 would be better magnification) but I get a whole list of
Latex warnings:

(C:\miktex2.7\tex\latex\psnfss\ot1pzc.fd
File: ot1pzc.fd 2001/06/04 font definitions for OT1/pzc.
)

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OT1/pzc/mb/it' will be
(Font)              scaled to size 14.39996pt on input line 197.


LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OT1/pzc/mb/it' will be
(Font)              scaled to size 9.59998pt on input line 197.


LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OT1/pzc/mb/it' will be
(Font)              scaled to size 7.19998pt on input line 197.

[1] [2]

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OT1/pzc/mb/it' will be
(Font)              scaled to size 11.99997pt on input line 316.


LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OT1/pzc/mb/it' will be
(Font)              scaled to size 8.39998pt on input line 316.


LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OT1/pzc/mb/it' will be
(Font)              scaled to size 5.99998pt on input line 316.

Later on I got the warning

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OT1/pzc/mb/it' will be
(Font)              scaled to size 17.27994pt on input line 1134.

Line 197 uses the font twice, both as subscripts while line 316 has no
reference to that font at all.  The first usage of the full-size fonts
is on line 217.  Line 1135 (not 1134) contains the first usage of a
lower case character in the font.

Are these warnings of any significance?  Why, when I am using it in only
two sizes, are there seven such warnings, three not associated with any
usage and none associated with the first usage of the larger size?

And is there any better documentation of NFSS (by now it should be
called OFSS) than there was in the 90s?

Sir,
 Please clarify my doubt. I am an author of tech books and a professor.
 The letters of the pdf output is very thin. Press people say that the plates for offset printing should change frequently if the thickness is not improved. This is very expensive.
 In spite of the command at preamble \fontencoding{0T1}\fontfamily{cmr}\fontseries{ebux}\fontshape{n} it does not work.

Can you be more explicit?  Did you encounter a broken link?  Are
you looking for a complete TeX system or a particular macro package
to use with an existing system?   Does the "begin.html" page need
some clarifications/expansion?

I have some experience with this.  There are two parts to your problem:

1.  the design itself.  I gather you may already have some ideas for this, 
e.g., some change relative to a previous project.  It is very helpful if 
you can describe your goals in terms of "like this widely available book 
(so others can see what you mean), but with the following changes..."
If you post this information, you may learn that some of the elements
in your design are problematic -- you can only hope that someone 
can suggest a compromise or workaround.

2.  implementing the design (e.g., in LaTeX).  As you probably realize,
the book class in the LaTeX base package is not a good example and is
not parameterized in way that gives a designer adequate flexibility.
Others have mentioned the memoir class, which is vastly more flexible,
but may still have limitations that are best overcome using a new class,
or even some other TeX system such as ConTeXt.

The first thing to realize is that LaTeX markup is designed to describe 
the logical structure of a document -- some people with backgrounds 
similar to yours find it difficult to get past the tendency to mix design 
and structure in the markup, e.g., things like:

\section*{\sectionfont{X-Z -- Foo}}

\subsection*{\subsectionfont{X-Z.1 -- Bar}}

rather than adjust the style to use the desired number scheme and fonts.
Some projects just don't have the logical structure found in conventional
technical material (e.g., a different design for every chapter -- imagine 
a book on design in which each chapter illustrates a different approach) 
so you don't get the benefits of logical markup.

First focus on the design itself.  They try to implement it following
the suggestions you get here.  When you encounter a problem that you
can't solve with the manuals and google, post it here and hope someone
offers a solution.

It is a common complaint by some that the cmr fonts are too thin. Rather
than try to thicken them, I'd suggest you use a different font. 

Try removing all your fontenconding, etc. directives and simply add:

\usepackage{mathptmx}

to your preamble. That will use the mathplus times fonts instead. I
prefer them for precisely the reason that they are thicker. Or move away
from times/serif fonts to sans serif ones. See
http://dtrx.de/od/tex/sfmath.html for a discussion of the options.

There may also be differences depending on how you generate your pdf,
i.e., from dvipdf or directly from pdflatex, but I doubt it.

"Since having a high quality font set in scalable outline form that works 
with TeX can give a publisher a real competitive advantage, there are some 
publishers that have paid (a lot) to have such font sets made for them. 
Unfortunately, these sets are not available on the open market, despite 
the likelihood that they?re more complete than those that are."(UK TeX FAQ):

I suspect very few math books get long enough runs for durability of 
plates to be an issue.  Computer Modern was designed to be light, so you 
need to use a different set of fonts.  There are only a few free 
alternatives. See:

<http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/mathfonts.html> (free)

<http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=psfchoice>

Lucida Bright is not free but also not expensive.  If you can wait, the 
free STIX fonts are "coming soon".

I am not sure if you really want to use something other than Computer
Modern, but if you do, Stephen Hartke's survey at
  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Free_Math_Font_Survey/survey.html
is the best reference I know of.

Many millions of pages have been printed using Computer Modern without
any hue and cry from "press people", so I am a bit skeptical.

Best,

That is correct.  I too live in Trivandrum as the OP and haven't
encountered any kind of resistance from the "press people" when I
approached them for printing many manuals typeset using CMR.  Indeed,
St Joseph's Press (the best in Trivandrum) is a TeX aware print house!

I don't think there is a way to do this in LaTeX, but you should
introduce yourself to imagemagick, which does stuff like that quite
easily and simply on the command line or in many different kinds of
scripts.  See imagemagick.org

Dear Sirs,



I work for an Iranian Christian charity in the UK who publishes literature
in Persian. I heard about Tex software through one of my friends who is a
semi professional typesetter and downloaded the program and started working
with it. I have some computer skills and kind of found my ways around it but
still I am a beginner and would like to become a professional typesetter.
Typesetting of the scriptures and the books has always been the bottleneck
for our publications and we are kind of fed up with it. We tried indesign
but it didn't work for us. I was wondering if there would be any training
courses which I could take. I am ready to pay for the training and would be
grateful if you could kindly advice me on this. Are there any training
courses available in the UK?

The UK has a great TeX and typographical traditions, so I'm sure  
you'll find what you need to succeed as a professional typesetter. My  
only advice is to take a look at XeTeX:

http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex

chances are you already have it installed.

Axel

Since you're in the UK, perhaps the UK TeX Users Group will have
information about courses you might be interested in. Have you
contacted them?

What I would do would be to make two separate files, one for the text, one 
for the illustrations, and figure out how to advance the page count by 2 
each time.  I don't know offhand how to do this, but it shouldn't be too 
hard.

I've found it! It occurred to me that one should google for verso and  
recto pages, instead of odd and even, and, yes, here it is:

http://www.latex-community.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1089&p=3837

I don't know who this juanjo is (Juanjo is hypocoristic for Juan  
Jos?), but his code works!

To make floats-only pages empty, put in your preamble

\usepackage{floatpag}
\floatpagestyle{empty}

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.43.0806111604530.3504@hymn13.u.washington.edu>


Hi,
I'm not sure I'm contacting the right address but I like pstricks a lot, but always have a problem getting the correct scaling on the postscript figures I produce.
Specifically, there always seems to be a lot of white space surrounding what I have drawn, and this manifests itself in not being able to put text around the figures when I insert them in documents,

thanks for your help
best
Jon

How to make the font of graphics with tex  (created with GIMP, BKchem or other drawing programs and added to the latex document with \includegraphics{graph.eps}) similar with the default font of the   latex document.

I'd say try to find a font that you can use. F.ex, use the "times"  
package, then use times in gimp, depending on what type of graphics  
you're creating there are some other tricks though. I've been using  
XFig for simple drawings, fig files can be converted to .pstex files  
using fig2dev. However, if you're bound to use eps files, then you'd  
need to make sure that fonts are the same in both documents. I'm not  
sure if there are ways of using the default tex fonts other programs.

Have a look at the semioneside package.  It's far from being a robust
solution, but it might help.

The best thing to do is to use something like psfrag so that TeX is  
responsible for placing the labels on the graphic --- that way if you  
change the document font, you don't have to change all of the graphics.

Do you have MacTeX also in your laptop? \text needs amsmath, and in  
the example you posted you don't have amsmath active.

I would advise you to subscribe to the TeX on Mac OS X mailing list

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

and post a minimal example of your problem, not just your preamble.  
Also, the log file would be useful. One more advice: don't use  
applemac as your input encoding, but utf8 (remember it is not enough  
to put the encoding in your preamble; you have to tell TeXShop ---and  
any other editor, for that matter--- to use it: TeXShop ->  
Preferences -> Document tab -> Encoding pull down menu).

One more thing ---if you also write in Hebrew, you might want to  
consider XeTeX:

http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex

You already have it in your MacTeX installation.


Best,

Axel

I don't know much more than you, I just sometimes help an arabist.
Usually packages come with some explanation of how to use them,
couldn't you find any?
There is a manual for ArabTeX, maybe it's not easy to find it,
it may have been this one that I found by chance some months ago.

Iwona produces faked small caps, but I think that's the best you can  
get with san serif fonts, even with commercial fonts.

Dear All,

I have 4 tables, each one big enough to occupy a page. Right now, I
have for each table:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{table*}
\begin{center}
\resizebox{14cm}{!} {
\begin{tabular} {c | c | c c | c c | c c}

                    .

\end{tabular}
}
\end{center}
\caption{}
\end{table*}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But i want all 4 tables as subtables of one table, but with each
subtable on a different page. How do i achieve it? \pagebreak[] does
not seem to work.

TIA.
Arvind

I seem to have misunderstood this before. To insert just a character
it would suffice to install an Arabic font (which MiKTeX will do for you!)
and some \DeclareFixedFont (I guess it will be so simple, no size changing)
-- see the LaTeX Companion or fntguide.dvi in miktex\doc\latex\base
(guessed, I don't have MiKTeX at my present place) for \DeclareFixedFont.
Say, \DeclareFixedFont{\arabfont}... To get the character then:
{\arabfont \char"XY} where XY is the hex code of the character.
To find it out, you can experiment, or look at the comprehensive list
of LaTeX symbols (symbols-A4.pdf or so, or ...dvi in the doc tree of
miktex?), or in the documentation of a package using the font ...
-- But it seems to be easer just to use some Arab package and
proceed along its lines.

This all has been "theory" I know of. I don't remember that I ever had
done something like this myself.

Helvetica is a sans font with small caps.

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[scaled]{helvet}

% If you want the base font of the document to be sans serif:

Thanks Samuel, but that is not what i want. I will try to elaborate.

They are 4 separate tables, but i want them to be numbered as say
table(1a), table(1b), table(1c), table(1d). So i want each of them as
a subtable in table 1. The subtable package does this, but it tries to
squeeze all 4 subtables into a single page. \pagebreak does not work
within a table. Nor do i see any option to have \subtable and/or
\pagebreak within a \longtable.

To summarize, i want 4 subtables of a single table on 4 successive
pages of the manuscript. But \subtable[] squeezes all of them on a
single page. Please provide a solution.

Thanks.

I doesn't the caption package have a feature one can use to continue a 
float? Of course one might have to play with the numbering a bit...

Personally, I've never used them, but it looks like either sublabel or
subfloat could be a useful package for you. On my TeXLive 2007
installation, sublabel seems to have more documentation.

nice request; dirty trick, working at my test:

     \renewcommand{\refname}{References\label{refref}}

... to be referred to by \pageref{refref}

A quick and dirty solution would be:

\renewcommand\thetable{\arabic{table}a}

\begin{table}
\caption{Whatever}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
...
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\clearpage
\addtocounter{table}{-1}
\renewcommand\thetable{\arabic{table}b}

\begin{table}
\caption{Whatever}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
...
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\clearpage
\addtocounter{table}{-1}
\renewcommand\thetable{\arabic{table}c}

\begin{table}
\caption{Whatever}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
...
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\clearpage
\addtocounter{table}{-1}
\renewcommand\thetable{\arabic{table}d}

\begin{table}
\caption{Whatever}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
...
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\renecommand\thetable{\arabic{table}}

If you modify the quick and dirty solution in my previous post to the
following, it will be much more elegant:

\usepackage{subfloat}

\begin{subtables}

 \begin{table}
 \caption{Whatever}
 \begin{tabular}{lcr}
 ...
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

 \clearpage

 \begin{table}
 \caption{Whatever}
 \begin{tabular}{lcr}
 ...
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

 \clearpage

 \begin{table}
 \caption{Whatever}
 \begin{tabular}{lcr}
 ...
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

 \clearpage

 \begin{table}
 \caption{Whatever}
 \begin{tabular}{lcr}
 ...
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

\end{subtables}

This might be what you are looking for.

 Happy TeXing and best regards

Thanks a lot Nina. This seems to work. Only a small doubt, is it
possible to have a caption for the whole \subtables?
Right now, I have something like:

Table 1a: Caption whatever
Table 1b: Caption whatever
Table 1c: Caption whatever
Table 1d: Caption whatever

I would also like to have, after "Table 1d: Caption whatever", another
common caption for all the tables, something like:

Table 1: The 4 tables describe blah blah blah

Is that possible? I am not able to put a caption outside the last
\end{table} and \end{subtables}. If a put a caption before the last
\end{table}, it numbers it as Table 1e: and not as Table 1.

Thank you once again.

Regards,
Arvind

Please modify the last table as given below:

\begin{table}

\caption{Fourth subtable caption}
\def\thesubfloattable{\themaintable}
\caption{The 4 tables describe blah blah blah}
\end{table}

Hello all,

Is it possible to use arithmetic inside of PStricks coordinates? for 
example, something like:

...
\def\boxsize{1.4}
...
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(10,10)
\psframe(4,5)(6,5 + \boxsize)
...
\end{pspicture}
...

Thanks for any suggestions,

\SpecialCoor
\psframe(4,5)(!6 5 \boxsize\space add)

or define

then you do not need the \space macro

Subject: [texhax] Howto page numeration in letters (i, ii, iii, iv...)
Message-ID: <48583803.3090106@gmail.com>

Hi there,

anyone could help me with this.

I have a 20 pages book document where the first 4 are the front page and 
the table of contents. I want to numerate it in letters instead of numbers:

i, ii, iii instead of 1, 2, 3.

I know is possible, but I didn?t found how. Any help will be appreciated ;).

Thanks in advance, Simon!

Message-ID: <33791.71.167.178.38.1213741086.squirrel@mail.highspeedrails.com>

1.  PROBLEM SETTING \LEFTHYPHENMIN.

I would like to set \lefthyphenmin=3 for English on a multilingual system.
 The default value is 2.  All direction which I have found suggests adding
\lefthyphenmin=<value> to hyphen.cfg .  Yet, none of the direction which I
have found seems to specify where hyphen.cfg should be located.

There is a hyphen.cfg from the babel LaTex package included in
texlive-latex-base on my Debian system.  However, I understand that direct
local use modifications of the package files as supplied is the wrong
place to make changes because it complicates updating.

Q1.  How and where should I set \lefthyphenmin=3 for English?

Q2.  Do I need to reconfigure TeX after making the necessary change?


2.  VERSION.

I am using TeX Live 2005 packages which have been packaged for
distribution with Debian GNU/Linux etch, the current stable version.  Both
TeTeX 3.0 and TeX Live 2005 are available on Debian etch.  TeX Live 2007
is now part of Debian testing and will be in the next stable version of
Debian.

After \begin{document}

\frontmatter
\pagenumbering{roman}%%% or {Roman}, if you want I, II, III, IV

Then, after the Table of Contents,

\mainmatter
\pagenumbering{arabic}

See The not so Short Introduction to LaTeX:

you can bury it in a box:

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

a math expression with two kinds of bold:
\[ \mathbf{a} + \hbox{\mathversion{bold}$a$} + a \]

\end{document}

it's easy enough to make a macro out of that too.

\bfseries ???

the solution depends on whether the \normalfont command is run 
somewhere, so the solution depends on your documnet.

    Q1.  How and where should I set \lefthyphenmin=3 for English?

In your document.  (Or in a personal .sty file that your document reads,
whatever.)

    Q2.  Do I need to reconfigure TeX after making the necessary change?

No.  It's undesirable to make the default be \lefthyphenmin=3.  Then
your processing of TeX documents would yield different results than
everyone else's.

Dear Texhackers:

I have gotten hyperref running nicely so my pdf has lovely hyper
links, but there is an odd side effect:  my pages are shifted down by
some amount and so the page number goes off the bottom.  Yes, I can:

\topmargin -0.5in % to shift the whole thing up

but I shouldn't have to do it.  Any idea what's the cause and/or how
to avoid it?

Don't you have it already? I use TeXLive 2007 and it came with the  
font and ancillary files:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{uncial}
\begin{document}
This is Computer Modern

\unclfamily And this is Uncial

or

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{uncial}

All text in Uncial

Subject: [texhax] cellcolor woes
Message-ID: <20080619164751.GA26026@doberman.l.localdomain>

Hello all:

Attached is some code demonsrating for a little problem I'm
having using \cellcolor in a table.  The table code is autogenerated by
another script, but I've trimmed it down to fit on one screen.

When DoCellColoring is defined to use cellcolor, the \clines from the
end of the previous row are being covered up.  If DoCellColoring is
defined to do nothing, you see what I'd like the table cell borders
to look like (without the colored cells).

This seems to be a pretty straightforward problem, but I've little
mention of it online.  I've tried using \multicolumn and \multirow
with \columncolor and \rowcolor as one guide suggested \cellcolor mimics
the affects of, but no dice.

Can someone provide a pointer to some documentation around this or
perhaps even an outright fix?

Many thanks,

Thanks, but the topmargin does the job (though it shifts the display
up on the screen while it corrects the pdf).  I don't want to have to
change my class files and I don't want to do this all the time.  The
question is why it's happening.  It seems to be an unnecessary side
effect.

I don't understand what you mean ---LaTeX *does* pagination  
automatically.

Can you further explain what you mean?

You seem to have different page sizes for different jobs, i.e., US
letter size for your LaTeX job and A4 size for your dvips job or vice
versa.  If you make the page sizes of both jobs the same, I think the
problem will disappear.

Happy TeXing and best regards

I see ---much of it (if not all, but I doubt about the colons or the  
three consecutive words at beginning or ending of adjacent lines in a  
paragraph) can be achieved, though I'm against it ---I think we  
should format pages almost as old typists did, that's why I set widow  
and club penalties to their defaults, parskip to 0 plus 0 minus 0,  
maxdepth to 0, etc.

But here it is ---see TeX for the Impatient:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/impatient/

you can download everything or just the book.pdf. See in page 125 the  
information about \hyphenpenalty and especially  
\doublehyphendemerits; set the last value high to (try to) avoid  
consecutive hyphens. See page 138 for club and widow penalties and  
set their values much higher than the default.

Also, (La)TeX will need to know what to do to avoid a club or widow,  
so setting \parskip and \maxdepth (p. 141) to higher values than the  
default would help, as well as \raggedbottom (p. 137).

Lastly, if you're using pdfLaTeX, the microtype package comes very  
handy: its expansion feature will help avoiding hyphenation as much  
as possible.

Best,

Axel

I would use a tabular environment; see The not so Short Introduction  
to LaTeX:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/

If numbers are in math mode, I've used the alignat environment from  
amsmath; see, v.gr., Herbert Vo?'s Mathmode:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/math/voss/mathmode/Mathmode.pdf

and amsmath User's Guide:

Subject: [texhax] special hyphenation
Message-ID: <200806201031.32006.natercia@eq.uc.pt>

Hi all,

I would like to known if there is a way to "protect" the symbol hiphen in 
words that have it themselves. That is:

In portuguese words having a hiphen are very common.
When I write a LaTeX document in portuguese I type things like
viram-nas
empenharam-se.

There are 2 different problems when these words have to be broken over two 
lines (hyphenated):
1. LaTeX always breaks them in the "-" they have, even if the result would be 
very different if such symbol was absent.

2. In portuguese the hyphenation is possible also at the place where the "-" 
is, but in this case the next line should begin with another hyphen (rule 
that LaTeX doesn't follow if I type the words simply as above).
For example, the word "empenharam-se" can be hyphenated according to 
portuguese rules like this:

em-                                        1st line
penharam-se                          2nd line

or

empe-
nharam-se

or
empenha-
ram-se

or (and the problem is here)
empenharam-
-se                                        (note the hyphen at the beginning 
of this second line)


How can I tell LaTeX that:
1. the "-" is nost employed in the sense of "hyphenate here"?
2. if it hyphenates at a "-" then it should insert another "-" at the 
beginning of the second line?

Until now I've looked at the final document and solved these situations 
mannually, but this is not a solution considering the high frequency of words 
with such characteristics in a text.

Thanks,
Nat?rcia

... and if you are smart, you perhaps can gain from looking at
package `listliketab', just for how to imitate a list style in a
tabular environment. Perhaps ask Scott Pakin for extending
his package -- Mahi's idea is interesting and worth a package,
I think!

I'm definitely not smart, but anyway I've taken a look at listliketab  
and it's certainly wonderful! Another package to ease my work!

1. Have you tried the babel package (LaTeX distribution) and its Portuges 
module?
[It seems to me that it doesn't support your 2nd desirement]

2. In general, \mbox{-} would produce a visible hyphen at which
no line-break will occur. My problem is here, that it is not clear
to me whether you want a break here or not. I guess you mean:
     a. a break at an explicit hyphen should not be preferred
         to other possible breaks -- indeed, usual TeX suppresses
         other breaks in words containing an explicit hyphen
     b. a break at an explicit hyphen should work differently
         than other breaks.

german.sty provides features in this direction ... and there is
the \discretionary command of TeX, TeXbook p. 95.

On 2a. above: TeX's idea to suppress other breaks has its merits
-- another break than at the explicit hyphen may be confusing.
With german.sty, I use "- to allow a different break in such a case,
but I care that the different break is two syllables away from the
explicit hyphen.

So I SUGGEST two things:

Concerning BOTH: I suggest to redefine \= (originally an accent)
to produce the explicit hyphen with the special breaking feature.

The SIMPLE thing allows unrestricted hyphenation at
different places of the word:

\makeatletter
\renewcommand*{\=}{%
   \penalty\@M\discretionary{-}{-}{-}\hskip\z at skip}
\makeatother

The SOPHISTICATED thing suppresses hyphenation at
different places than explicit hyphen, but you can use
\- to override this suppression. \- is redefined, originally
it allows hyphenation suppressing other hyphenations
of the word. The new definition works like "- from german.sty:

\makeatletter
\renewcommand*{\-}{%
   \penalty\@M\discretionary{-}{}{}\penalty\@M\hskip\z at skip}
\renewcommand*{\=}{\discretionary{-}{-}{-}}
\makeatother

... well, I hope so. Please tell if it doesn't work as suggested.

Uwe.

See at http://www.ieeta.pt/~tos/TeX.html Tom?s Oliveira e Silva's  
bundle pt_language. If his instructions seem too complex, just put in  
your preamble

\usepackage[portuges]{babel}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}%% or [latin1]
\makeatletter
\DeclareRobustCommand{\pt at hyphen}{\ifmmode_\else
   \nobreak\hskip\z at skip\discretionary{-}{-}{-}\nobreak\hskip\z at skip\fi}
\catcode`_=\active
\let_=\pt at hyphen
\makeatother

and type viram_nas, empenharam_se instead of viram-nas, empenharam-se.


Best,

Axel

To have other hyphenation points you need to set a different hyphenation
character than the one you type in the text.  (Do pdftex and microtype fix
this gaffe in TeX?)  That is possible with T1 font encoding: set the 
hyphen-character to be the "overhanging" one.

Once "-" is no longer the hyphen character, it should be included
in language hyphenation patterns as if it were a letter, allowing
hyphenation before itelf.  Years ago I made such additions to the 
Portuguese hyphenation patterns to do this, and sent them to various 
people, but either they weren't interested or I never got hold of the
actual maintainers (though one might assume they read comp.text.tex).
The base patterns were pt8hyph.tex:
% (C) 1996 by  Pedro J. de Rezende (rezende at dcc.unicamp.br)
%          and J.Joao Dias Almeida (jj at di.uminho.pt)
which had very restrictive modification rules...

Looking at CTAN now I see the rules have changed to LPPL, and also
the patterns have changed, so it should already work for you!

Back in 2001, my additions were tha comments:

% A LaTeX user can enable proper hyphenation, including hyphenation
% before explicit hyphens, with the declaractions:
%
% \lccode`\-=`\-
% \defaulthyphenchar=127
% \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
%
% or
%
% \lccode`\-=`\-
% \defaulthyphenchar=173
% \usepackage[LY1]{fontenc}

and a set of additional patterns:

5-4a4  % allow hyphenation before explicit hyphens, but forbid it
5-4b4  % for at least two letters after.
5-4c4
...
5-4z4
5-4^^e04
5-4^^e14
5-4^^e24
5-4^^e34
5-4^^e74
5-4^^e94
5-4^^e84
5-4^^ea4
5-4^^ed4
5-4^^ee4
5-4^^ef4
5-4^^f34
5-4^^f44
5-4^^f54
5-4^^f64
5-4^^fa4
5-4^^fb4

The new CTAN version has only the single pattern

1-

which should work (but will still allow lines to end like partirem-n-
so I still like my patterns better; the choice of 1 instead of 5 may
be better, allowing for future hyphen patterns to prevent specific
hyphenated words from breaking).

Since the patterns should work, I can only assume the LaTeX declarations
are absent from the babel support.  Indeed, I can find no "lccode" in
portugues.def (or .dtx).

So in your document, declare

 \lccode`\-=`\-
 \defaulthyphenchar=127
 \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
 \usepackage[portugues]{babel}

and see how it works.  If it does, please suggest to the babel-portuguese 
maintainers to provide this feature.

What babel does provide is "- as a macro-based solution (language shorthand)
for explicit hyphens, but it does not appear to put the hyphen on the next 
line.

Another thing, is this double-hyphen style used in Brazil as well?

No. I've seen it suggested in old books, but it is definitively not used
anymore.

However, allowing breaks in other parts of words with an hyphen will be
a nice addition to the Brazilian hyphenation patterns.

\lefthyphenmin=3 worked when I included in the 'document' part of the

Yes.  Although array.sty fixes \hline so it does not overlap the 
area occupied by the cell, \cline still overlaps.  It has to do so
because multiple \cline commands must be at the same level.  If
you put something big in a tabular cell ($\displaystyle\int$) you
see that a \cline partially overlaps the text.

I think major tricky rewriting of \cline and tabular would be 
needed to fix this well.

If there are no vertical lines, you can use

 ..& .. \\[.5\arrayrulewidth]
 \cline{} \cline{}
 \noalign{\vspace{.5\arrayrulewidth}}

If there are vertical lines it is very difficult, but maybe arydshln
is compatible with colortbl?

I spoke too soon. "1-" still allows breaks after the hyphen, like "partirem-
nas".  That simplest pattern should be "1-2" or "1-4" to prevent breaks
after the explicit hyphen.  Then a pattern like "1-2" could still leave
a single letter after the hyphen because TeX does not apply \lefthyphenmin
rules in the middle of a word.  So I still like the set of 
(odd)-(even)(letter)4

Any maintainers reading?

Maybe this type of hyphenation needs to be supported in a variant language,
if it is not always used.

Well, you do not supply much information do you?  In any case, to use
citations you have to use the \cite{} command with the (unique) name of
the reference between the braces or whatever they are called.  And
without the asterisks, tildes, and forward slashes as you include for
some reason.

In general, if something works and then suddenly stops working there
must be something between the two stages that are causing the error.
Try commenting ou selective parts of the document.  With a little
patience you wil locate your error.

Message-ID: <F03ADEB623564A439BE0502AC3F5ADF705E56BA2@ELSAMSEXCP02VA.science.regn.net>

Hello,

Elsevier's new document class for typeset journal articles,
elsarticle.cls, now available for user testing

Elsevier's document class for typeset articles elsart.cls is over 10
years old. Therefore it will be replaced with the newly written document
class elsarticle.cls, which was developed for Elsevier by the leading
TeX company River-Valley Technologies.

elsarticle.cls is based upon the standard LaTeX document class
article.cls. It uses natbib.sty for bibliographical references.

The following files are available:
- elsarticle.cls, the class file
- elsdoc.pdf, the user documentation
- elsarticle-template-num.tex, template file for numerical references
- elsarticle-template-harv.tex, template file for name-year references

Elsevier encourages authors to use this document class for testing, and
report bugs and problems to the developers of the class,
elsarticle at river-valley.com. It is the intention to finalize this
document class by the end of August. By that date it will be accepted
for submitted articles, both in Elsevier's electronic submission system
and otherwise.

The files can be found at Elsevier's web site, www.elsevier.com/latex,
last item on the page. The files have been submitted to CTAN, with
suggested location macros/latex/contrib/elsarticle.

Simon Pepping

What does it say that on the next-to-the-last page of the on-line  
version of the article, a character in a very simple equation is  
rendered using a TrueType .notdef square? To add insult to injury they  
repeat the equation w/ the same .notdef char.

It may say many things, but surely it says that nobody competent looks at

I've _been_ seeing these things for more than the past decade and am  
really tired of it.

Probably wouldn't be so irritated by this sort of thing if I hadn't  
spent a significant chunk of time at my previous job making a couple  
of hundred characters for use on www.medabbrev.com

And of course, there's the perfect hindsight thought of, ``if only Tim  
Berners-Lee had looked more towards TeXview.app on his NeXT Cube and  
used it as the basis for how to render text (and math) in  
worldwideweb.app.''

Subject: [texhax] header in glossary-chapter
Message-ID: <28314755.1214381209261.JavaMail.root@ps14>

Hello,

i have a custom header in my latex document.
when i use the glossaries-package and create a glossary than the 
header will not shown at the beginning of the glossary-chapter. how can 
i modify my code that my header will be also at the beginning of the 
glossary-chapter shown?

thats the code i use:
\usepackage[
nonumberlist, %keine Seitenzahlen anzeigen
%acronym, %ein Abk?rzungsverzeichnis erstellen
toc, %Eintr?ge im Inhaltsverzeichnis
numberedsection=autolabel % label f?r das Glossarverzeichnis vergeben
]{glossaries}
....
\input{chapters/myglossarydata}
...
\begin{document}
...
\begin{appendix} % Hier beginnt der Anhang
\printglossary[title=Glossar, toctitle=Glossar] %style=altlist,
\thispagestyle{fancy} 
\end{appendix} 
\end{document}

as you can see on the code: even the "\thispagestyle{fancy}"-statement 
does not solve my problem.
i am looking forward for you help.
greetings, peter

Alas, I need vertical lines (and you were correct, it was the vertical
lines that failed in the above solution).

Tried the dashed-line package, same issues.

But, all's well that ends well.  I never thought that \cline vs. \hline
was the crux of my problems.  I had always seen \hline work correctly,
so I assumed \cline would follow suit.

In the end, I re-organized my code to draw to independent tables with
colorcells and hlines, embedding these into a encapsulating table.  As
an added bonus, my python code is much cleaner now --- this was the
design I should have adopted in the first place.

Thanks for your help,

Download lshort.pdf from here

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/

See page 24: 2.4.8 Accents and Special Characters

It would be better if you put in your preamble \usepackage[T1] 
{fontenc} (see lshort pp. 81 and ff.).

Also, I would advice you to use \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}, *not*  
utf8x, as lshort (p. 26) says. But your editor has to be able to use  
utf8; for MikTeX, your choice would be TeXmaker:

Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.64.0806260844500.192@bryan-lepores-powerbook-g4-12.local>

i have a minipage table inside a figure environment.  the _figure_ appears 
in the list of figures (since \caption[this is a figure]{} is used). 
it'd be nice to have it appear in the list of tables also.

is there a way to do that without revamping the table-inside-a-figure to a 
figure-inside-a-table?

Gimp saves as bitmap. Psfrag requires the text string to be 
replaced to be present in the eps file.

Add your text labels directly with LaTeX using the overpic 
package or similar.

first of all why both? and why is a table inserted as a figure? just 
wondering.

Second, since figure floats placing

\addcontentsline{lot}{figure}{\protect\numberline{\thefigure}The text
  caption}

after \end{figure} may result in wrong page numbers, I would place it just 
before \end{figure}

(i think this is for me) : after sleeping on it, perhaps NOT both... i 
guess i meant if i can get both i can remove one.. (vide infra)

its a table of things that appear in the figure... somehow i started using 
minipage to do it.  "it just works"... BARELY....

[I were a student of analytical philosophy which seems to have been
driven by an enthusiastic idea that all problems will vanish as soon
as we discover what the words we are using mean:]

"Tables", in LaTeX, are typeset as "tabular" environments (or variants).
LaTeX "table" environments are floats meant to contain "tables"
-- which are typeset as LaTeX "tabular environments".

So I GUESS (note again how useful concrete examples may be
in query postings) Bryan has placed a "table" being a tabular
environment in a "figure" environment ... wants to have it not only
in the "list of figures", but also in the "list of tables" ...

However, TABLES ARE NOT FIGURES! Please don't list a table
as a figure! Just put it in a "table" environment so it is listed
in the "list of tables"! (... turning Lars' wonderings into a demand!)

Right?

[... to continue analytic reasoning, where the notion of "meta-language"
played an essential role: what about considering the "table of contents"
a float appearing in the list of tables? HA HA HA HA HA I'm roaring,
riding back to hell!!!...]

So, if someone could please tell me his current address could you please

because I sent two mails last night to the list only one of which was 
delivered to subscribers hours late...

Dear Professor Steven,

I would like to know how to get the distance between the columns 
narrower in Beamer (using \begin{columns},  \end{columns}), if that is 
possible.

I saw your e-mail address in a page from the help of Beamer ( 
http://tug.org/mail-archives/texhax/2006-April/005809.html ). In my 
example, I have two columns with one graphic in each column (the graphs 
are too big for being in one column). Do you know if it is possible to 
do this? I have tried to use colsep in this way:

\begin{columns}[colsep=1pt][c]

but it does not work.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Susana Conde

TeXhax is the user forum of the TeX user group (TUG).

You just have to specify the width of each column in the columns 
environment.

\begin{frame}
   \frametitle{Columns}
   \begin{columns}[totalwidth=\textwidth]
     \begin{column}{0.4\textwidth}
       \centering
       \texttt{0.4\string\textwidth}
       \rule{\linewidth}{2cm}%
     \end{column}%
     \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
       \centering
       \texttt{0.5\string\textwidth}
       \rule{\linewidth}{2cm}%
     \end{column}%
   \end{columns}
   \begin{center}
   \texttt{\string\textwidth}
   \rule{\linewidth}{1cm}%
   \end{center}
\end{frame}
