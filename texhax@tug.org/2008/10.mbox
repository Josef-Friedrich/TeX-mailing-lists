Subject: [texhax] Help with SOP writing..
Message-ID: <BLU109-DAV1B9BD5EF7378DDD58A697A4420@phx.gbl>

Hello,

I discovered Latex recently and think is just great. I've been working
Latex under Kile and Lyx.
I would like to transform/write some lab protocols, but none of the
standard latex document class fits the purpose correctly. Page headers
style and information, as well as document structure required in SOP are
not the same as for a normal publications.
I've been trying/playing with the fancyheaders package and with document
class creation, but with very poor results (specially for the document
class): I'm just a beginner on the matter, I also searched for any
SOP-like latex layout/example already available on the web with no
results. I know now that making a new document class is too ambitious
for my skills, so never mind on that. Common sense tell me to to work
with one of the available classes. However, before investing more time
on it I would like to ask if there is something close to SOP like
(fulfilling ISO req) already somewhere, and if not, If you could hand me
some hints on how to proceed. The specific points I'm stuck with are:
- How to make boxed headers (minor proplem, more a wish than a
requirement)
- How to ignore/oversee the general page numeration and replace it by
specific SOP page numbers.
- Making the headers appear only at the starting of each individual SOP.

Thanks for your attention.

Best regards,

Marcos Ablanque

Are you placing the algorithm inside a float? In that case don't, floats 
does not break.

Message-ID: <5ADD7A02A19DDC4885F8AECA894142D50128F96D@NDMSEVS32B.ndc.nasa.gov>

I am writing a dissertation in which the chapter title pages and some of
the front pages must have an extra one inch margin at the top.  The bulk
of the text has a one inch top margin, but the title pages require a 2
inch top margin.  Is it possible to enter something at the top of a page
that produces a blank but would be counted as part of the text height,
so that the bottom margins will always look the same?

Hi there!

When I write

\begin{align}
a&=b\nonumber
\\
&=c \nonumber
\\
&=d
\end{align}

I only get at number in the last line. But I want to do this in align and 
need a command that makes a number rather than suppress it

\begin{align*}
a&=b
\\
&=c
\\
&=d \yesnumber
\end{align*}

Does such a \yesnumber command exist?

Kind regards,

I don't know of a predefined one, but in my thesis I use:

% sometimes it is useful to tag some equations in an align* block but not
% others; \newtag can be used for this purpose
\newcommand{\newtag}{\tag{\theequation}\addtocounter{equation}{1}}

Not sure why one should not use {align} with \notag for all others

Better
\stepcounter{equation} or
\refstepcounter{equation} (if with hyperref)
instead of
\addtocounter{equation}{1}

What you'd like to do is simply add a \vspace{1in} at the beginning of
the page (or \vskip in plain tex), but (La)TeX will gobble this up. So
you need to put something invisible at the top of the page.

Try:

\phantom{.}\vspace{1in}

This may skip a bit too much (by \baselineskip it a line gets allocated
by the \phantom) but you can easily adjust the amount of \vspace to get
what you want.

Does this help?

Or use \vspace*{1in}.

Message-ID: <200810040051.m940pdv30548@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

Software news:

- TeX Live 2008 was released a few weeks ago.  For the first time,
  ongoing updates for TeX Live are available over the Internet for those
  who want them (a feature MiKTeX has provided for years).
  http://tug.org/texlive/

- The full TeX Collection DVD is at the production facility now (in
  Germany) and should ship within a few more weeks.  The TeX
  Collection contains new versions of proTeXt and MacTeX, as well as an
  updated snapshot of CTAN.
  http://tug.org/texcollection/

- TUG has received a renewed development grant from the same anonymous
  donor who generously provided support last year.  As before, we
  received $10,000 outright for TeX development and another $10,000 is
  available if we can match it.  We are attempting to raise
  institutional support, but individual contributions of any size are
  very welcome and very important, both to TUG and to the donor.  So
  please consider donating to the development fund in general, or a
  specific development project:
  https://www.tug.org/donate/
  
  The three main projects we are supporting are ongoing from last year:
  the TeX Gyre fonts (http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/),
  LuaTeX (http://www.luatex.org/), and the
  TeXworks front end (http://tug.org/texworks/).  For our rationale and
  past grants, see the development fund web pages:
  http://tug.org/tc/devfund/


Journals:

- The third issue of TUGboat for 2008 will be the proceedings for TUG'08.
  It is nearly complete and should make its way to the printer by the
  end of the month.
  http://tug.org/TUGboat/

- Issue 2008-2 of the PracTeX Journal has been published; the theme of
  this issue is LaTeX and TeX on the web.
  http://tug.org/pracjourn/


Interview Corner:

- Several more interviews have been completed since the last installment
  of this newsletter: Amy Hendrickson, Yuri Robbers, Tomas Rokicki,
  Han The Thanh, and Arthur Ogawa.
  http://tug.org/interviews/

- We are planning to produce the interviews as a book, since there has
  been considerable interest, but have no publication schedule as yet.


Conferences:

- Many of the presentations from TUG 2008 in Cork are available as
  online video, thanks to the indefatigable Kaveh Bazargan and River
  Valley Technologies.
  http://www.river-valley.tv/conferences/tug2008/

- BachoTeX 2009 will be held in Bachotek, Poland, from
  April 29-May 3, 2009.  http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2009/main-en.html

- TUG 2009 will be held at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend,
  Indiana, USA, from July 28-31, 2009.  http://tug.org/tug2009/

- EuroTeX 2009 will be held in The Hague, The Netherlands, from
  August 24-28, 2009.  http://www.ntg.nl/EuroTeX2009/


Printing history fellowship opportunity:

- The American Printing History Association invites applications for a
  fellowship of up to $2,000 to study any area of the history of
  printing in any form.  The deadline is 12 December 2008.  More
  information and an application form:
  http://printinghistory.org/htm/fellowship/


Finally, we on the board would like to welcome Alan Wetmore to the TUG
Bursary committee (http://tug.org/bursary), and thank Dave Walden for
his service on the committee for the last several years.  Dave remains
as the TUG treasurer.


As always, we appreciate your support!

Happy TeXing,
Karl Berry (President) on behalf of the TUG Board

Respected Sir/Mam,

I am an undergraduate and I have some doubts in Latex. I need the
procedure for creating own packages in detail. It would be really nice
if you explain it briefly.

To be specific there is a writing style called as "Edwardian Script"
in Ms word. I need that to be available in Latex.

Please reply at the earliest.

Hi Chandrasekhar,
creating the tfm and fd files needed by latex is not trivial.  Maybe
it's easier to use xelatex instead of latex.  xetex supports system
fonts (fonts in c:/windows/fonts) directly.  No conversion required.

Not an easy thing, really! If you have a recent TeX distribution (TeX  
Live or MiKTeX), type in your terminal or Command Prompt

texdoc clsguide <enter>

It's better to use existing packages. The better source is "The LaTeX  
Companion", 2nd ed. But see also Scott Pakin's

Subject: [texhax] Burning a dvd.
Message-ID: <200810050856.33701.john@wexfordpress.com>

I asked this question on alt.os.linux.slackware via google groups but 
that site seems to be broken.  No posts since Oct 3 on any newsgroup. 
Anyhow---
I have the dvd iso for Slackware current. I want to transfer that file 
to a dvd disk via my dvd-capable r/w drive. For a cdr I use:

cdrecord dev=1001,0,0 filename.iso

Will that work also for a dvd disk? Or is there a different 
incantation?  

I have already created some coasters fooling around, and the media is 
expensive. 

If necessary I can boot a Debian partition, but I hope it isn?t 
necessary.  I don?t speak Debian very fluently.

For any indexable item, if you create a command like
\sidx{foo at bar}
the item will sort as foo but will show bar.  That is the command for 
eplain. For LaTeX it is as I recall
\index{foo at bar}

Worst case you can edit the book.idx file after the first pass but 
before the makeindex pass to insert code foo at bar as I have suggested. 
Alternatively you can edit the output book.ind file and rearrange it.

So there are three different solutions. Take your pick.

I use K3b on my Debian. Apparently to put it into Slack you
do something like:


Go to http://www.slackware.com/getslack/ 
and coose a mirror close to your location and 
then browse to the directory 
slackware-10.2/slackware/ap/ 
and there you will find 
dvd+rw-tools-5.21.4.10.8-i486-1.tgz

# installpkg dvd+rw-tools-5.21.4.10.8-i486-1.tgz

# su -

http://www.slackware.com/getslack/ 
browse to the directory 
slackware-10.2/extra/k3b/ 

Download 
k3b-0.12.4a-i486-1.tgz package. 

Install 
# installpkg k3b-0.12.4a-i486-1.tgz

Then run
# k3b

YMMV with versions etc. Check on the latest appropriate
packages for your Slack distro for dvd tools and k3b.

The only difference between a DVD and a CD is its size and you can use
cdrecord as you described.  Hovever, to be sure you can try with the
-dummy option first as described in the man page.

Namaste,

Thank you so much for the info.

However, Iam still not able to understand Why my Colors are not working.  Do
you recommend that I should reinstall MikTex 2.7?
Iam using Windows and WinEdt.  You may refer to the same examples - I had
referred in my prev mail.

Also, I need to know the Down loadable software for Circuit Diagrams in
LaTeX?

Your help in this regard is appreciated.

Thank you,
Sincerely,
Vasudeva,,,

No, John doesn't want to create a new DVD image, he just wants to burn
the TeX Live ISO image on a DVD.  growisofs is not a solution.

But growisofs can do both!  The above command takes an existing
image.iso and burns it to device on /dev/dvd.

Hi

I am MikTeX user, and i am using a hyperref package with dvips option after creation of pdf the internal links are not going to the particular cite, figure etc. links, it goes only that particular page.

I want to use hyperref package with dvips option only, if anybody know the answer please post me.

Thanks for your answers.

I've followed this thread with interest as matching a preexisting
layout can be one of the more challenging aspects of Latex
document preparation (for me). I'd like to share my SOP templates
but that wouldn't be allowed.

After looking at the memoir manual, I'm curious, how well adopted
it is?  While it seems professionally done, it does so much that I
wonder if I take the time to adopt it will I be stranded if I get
stuck with some issue?

How many people are using it? How many people are interested in
providing user support should I get stuck?

I generally prefer the unix methodology that programs (packages)
do one thing, and very well. But if memoir just makes *everything*
easier, it may be worthwhile loading it in my documents.

What are the shortcomings of memoir?

Well, the manual is not always easy to understand for a novice.

I instruct all my users to use memoir, because in the long run it is a 
better investment than starting with the standard classes.

If you run into problems you just ask here or on comp.text.tex and there 
are a lot of people who can help

First, sorry for cross-posting..., but I really think members of these  
three lists might like ---and profit from--- the xfrac package, by  
Morten H?gholm.

xfrac allows you to use split fractions in a new way, both using the  
defaults or, better yet, creating your own instances per font family,  
and both in text and math modes.

I've been using xfrac for some time; unfortunately, its dependencies  
in TeX Live 2007 were outdated ---I got the right ancillary files from  
the LaTeX3 project, I think.

But now with TeX Live 2008 we have a new xfrac package and all needed  
dependencies are there and up to date.

If you're interested,

texdoc xfrac


Best,

Axel

For some of the documents I write I would like to include a line in the 
upper left corner of the first page containing (a) the directory and 
name of the main file, and (b) the date and the time the document was 
printed.  At the same time I would like to drop the date that appears by 
default when using the \maketitle command.

I know about the \jobname command which gives the name of the main file 
(without the extension), but how do I get hold of the (full) directory 
path and the date/time?

Hi Tom,

from the top of my head I can only answer parts of your questions; maybe
I'll find more time for the rest later.

>I would like to drop the date that appears by default when using the

use an empty \date{} command before the \maketitle command.

Date: \today

Hope that helps as first steps towards your goal,

The inclusion of \date{} works fine.  Thanks.  And I have assumed that a 
  corresponding \time{} function, but I have not located it,  Perhaps 
\clock{}, no.  And the directory, what would that be?

Hi Tom:

I'm sorry to have missed the original post on this, so pardon me please
if I'm slightly off target. 

I have accomplished related goals by using the rcsinfo.sty package (the
documents in question were checked into a CVS archive).  The package
makes parts of the RCS string available.  You do this at the top of the
file: 

  \rcsInfo $Id: ripr33.tex,v 1.1 2008-09-28 02:54:47 tomfool Exp $

And then parts of the string are available as \RCSInfoDate and so on.
The actual package also has header formatting facilities, which I didn't
need, but the rcs string parsing stuff was pretty easy to carve off into
a separate package.

About ten years ago I implemented a class that used the mktextex
business, about which I've forgotten almost everything, but I find this
in an old class definition:

 \DeclareOption{draft}
   {\message{Using `draft' format}\input pwd.tex\@paperdrafttrue}

 ...

 %  In draft mode, the footer will have the time and date on it.  It
 %  will also have the name of the file on the right hand side.  In
  %  order for this to work, there must be a file called mktextex in the
  %  \$PATH (apparently ~/bin doesn't work for AucTeX) with the following
 %  contents: 
 %
 %<*mktex>
 echo "\def\dirname{`pwd`}" >$1
 echo $1
 %</mktex>
 %
 %  This will create a file called pwd.tex in the directory, whose
 %  contents are the \$PWD.  This is not a perfect solution, since it
 %  leaves little pwd.tex files all over the place, but so it goes.
 %
  ...
 \if at paperdraft
 \fancyfoot[L]{\sectfont\today}
 \fancyfoot[R]{\sectfont\dirname/\jobname}
 \fi

This is not very portable, and I think it's kind of a security issue for
some purposes, but it might work for you.

There are possibly more stylish ways to do these things now, but these
two have worked for me.  Hope this helps,

 -tom

This one did not work on a Windows system using MikTex, but I'll have a

The datetime package looks fine (I assume you are the person behind that

unable locate any documentation.  I'll keep searching.

See the 'pwd' there?  That's 'print working directory', a command
under all unix operating systems such as Linux.  It probably doesn't
exist in Bill's brain.  However perhaps you can put unix on your
machine (ubuntu!) or make a unix platform (Cygwin) in which you can
run the program.

The datetime package provides a command for printing the current time 
(you can change the format). I think the fink package provides a command 
to access the directory name.

Tom:

Thank you, I was looking at that part and could not understand why it 
was there.  The error message from the MikTex Windows installation I am 
working with at the moment indicated that a file named path.tex was 
missing.  When I created such a file it worked, but I did not get the 
path for the main file in the output.  And the file was empty after 
running, so the write18 part was not understandable.

In any case I have to admit that the machine I am using is a dual boot 
one, with Ubuntu as the alternative to Windows XP.  However, I have only 
sniffed at Latex under Windows, all the serious work using Latex 
(started 2-3 years ago) have been under Windows.  I have not considered 
Cygwin yet, perhaps I should.

Let's avoid a discussion about this brain, please.

However, on Windows you could try to invoke 'cd' without any
arguments.  It does something similar as 'pwd' on Unix.

Hi,

I am including a pdf (or jpg) file in my TeXShop Tex code (mac, with TeX/Ghostscript), using a simple line of includgraphics. In the output pdf, I see the filename written as a title over the graph. I don't want that - any ideas how I can change this?

Many thanks,

'cd' without arguments is to MSDOS (and therefore presumably to modern
Windows versions as well) as 'pwd' is to Linux.  ('cd' without
arguments on Linux will, however, change the working directory to the
user's home directory, so watch out).  Although I don't know how you'd
get the rest of it, particularly the output redirection '>', to work.

That part certainly looks strange to me, but for the time being I am 
working with Windows.  I'll have a look at \cd, but I do not want a 
directory change.

I must say that I regard the documentation to the fink package as quite 
dense and not very readable for a non-nerd user of Latex.

As I recall input and output redirection works on MSDOS as well.  For 
example the command
more beer
on *nix is
more <beer 
on MSDOS. 
Or so I recall. Can find an MSDOS manual at the moment. Must have 
tossed them. Oh well.

cd on all systems I have used means ?change directory?.  On Windows 
and often on *nix systems the current directory is part of the 
prompt. ?pwd? means print working directory on *nix systems.  

The MSDOS command set is taken from Unix, but in a much simplified 
form. Since Microsoft sold Xenix (a Unix variant) at one time 
presumably Bill knows all the Unix commands.  As I recall Microsoft 
then sold the Xenix product to Santa Cruz Operations (aka SCO). But 
don?t hold me to that. It all happened a long, long, time ago. 

A way to use Linux without going through the bother of an installation 
is to use a Knoppix cdr (Debian derivative) or a Slax cdr (Slackware 
derivative.) These boot themselves. They make useful emergency rescue 
disks also.  If your files are readable at all you can copy them from 
a corrupted MSWin partition to a flash drive or whatever.  Linux 
doesn?t use the registry to find files.

Hi to all TeX users.

, but without being a new paragraph really begun.  In other words, I wish that
those two blank lines (before and after displayed equation) had no effect.  Is

Not quite a blank line but close enough :)

Thanks, but that can't work.  I'll explain why I want that.  I use Emacs as
text editor, and the command `M-q' fills a paragraph.  So I need that in my
.tex file paragraphs are separated by blank lines, else paragraphs will be
messed up by `M-q'.

Bye
Rodolfo

I use AUCTeX 11.83 and it fills paragraphs correctly with the % lines
around displayed math.

I use AUCTeX 11.84.  Do you mean this:


bla bla bla
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$$x = y$$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
bla bla


or this:


bla bla bla
%
$$x = y$$
%
bla bla



?  Because, this latter does not work for me, however the former could be a
possible (not very nice) solution.

Thanks

I use AUCTeX 11.85, and M-q fills paragraphs correctly for me even
*without* the surrounding %'s. I.e.

bla bla bla
$$x = y$$
bla bla <hit M-q>

I didn't do anything special to configure AUCTeX.

However, when I try that on another computer with the same version of

Which is very strange because I don't see any differences in

are no customizations of TeX-mode filling).

That's strange, here I'm using version 11.83 and the second one works
perfectly. As a matter of fact, even if there is no separation between
the text and the displayed equation, auctex properly identifies the
paragraphs, when filling them.

This was because in the end of the file I have:

%%% Local Variables: 
%%% mode: plain-TeX 
%%% End:

I changed plain-TeX into TeX and now it works.  I wonder if there is a way to
make it work also without changing that.

Hey, fantastic!  How can I uninstall 11.84 and install 11.85?  I installed it
from a tar.gz package.

What do you mean by `no separation'?  Even without the `%' line?

Exactly, like others have reported. The equation is considered a
separate paragraph.

I have this in my .emacs:

(custom-set-variables
  ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 '(LaTeX-paragraph-commands (quote ("orderedlist" "unorderedlist" "li"))))

This was obviously created using customize, but this should work too:

  (setq LaTeX-paragraph-commands '("orderedlist" "unorderedlist" "li"))

However, it seems there's a related bug in AUCTeX:

Also when the displayed equation is longer than only one line, say two or more

Does the above setting work in your case, despite of the bug?  Or do you have
an Emacs version where the bug has been fixed?

Ah, interesting. It works for the text preceding the equation, but not
for the succeeding text. So:

bla bla
bla <M-q>
$$ long equation
= over two lines$$
bla bla
bla

becomes:

bla bla bla
$$ long equation
= over two lines$$
bla bla
bla

but:

bla bla bla
$$ long equation
= over two lines$$
bla bla <M-q>
bla

becomes:

bla bla bla
$$ long equation
= over two lines$$ bla bla bla

If I use a blank commented line between the equation and text, it works
again:

bla bla bla
$$ long equation
= over two lines$$
%
bla bla <M-q>
bla

becomes:

bla bla bla
$$ long equation
= over two lines$$
%
bla bla bla

In my opinion, this is a minor bug in AUCTeX's paragraph fill settings,
so maybe you should report it to them.

In my case lines beginning with a command are never filled.  I could
never get LaTeX-paragraph-commands to work, so that setting just
uselessly remained in my .emacs.  So there's probably yet another bug
on my installation.

The following lines aren't successfull (to no surprise).

\mode

\setbeamerfont{footline}{series={\normalseries}}
\setbeamerfont{headline}{series={\normalfont}}

Subject: [texhax] Problems with shapepar
Message-ID: <48F346EE.1050408@wmi.com>

Hi,

I've got a problem that I can't quite get a handle on.
I'm trying to use shapepar (Version 2.1, 2006-11-18) to
typeset some text in a circle. I get the following error

   ! Arithmetic overflow.
   \fpdivide ...1=\dimexpr #1*\p@ /\@tempcntb \relax

   l.13

The line number varies depending on how much text is
in the circle. i.e. how many lines are not commented out.
If there is a small amount of text then it works ok.

If I try another shape like heartpar or starpar it
works fine. Here's my input. For what it's worth, I'm
running MikTeX 2.7

\documentclass{article}

Greetings!

I've been working with LaTeX for a while and had an idea I wanted to
work on. I implemented the basic algorithom in C++. Now I'd like to
make package. I've been reading through documentation on the
`programming' aspects of TeX and LaTeX, but can't find out how to
either  execute another program (Preferable solution) or parse a
command's input (eg, access newcommand's #1 in individual characters).

If anyone could tell me how to do either, I would be very greatful.

Thanks,

Christopher Olah

There was a recent discussion on the use of write18 that did a pwd.

http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2008-October/011144.html

and another one I found by google:

Hi!  I am trying to set up Protext on my home computer (Windows XP).  I 
downloaded the file OK, but as it was installing I got an error message 
saying that installation could not be completed because some 
installation files were corrupt.  I tried going to miktex.org and 
downloading Miktex 2.7 but I also got error messages trying to install 
that.  Is there something I'm missing or is there a problem with the 
files that are out there?  

Your help is greatly appreciated!

they should do that automatically

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
\[
    \cosh ax \qquad \cosh(ax)
\]
\end{document}

in the case of the \cosh(ax) no space is needed as the ()'s already 
provide the separation.

Note that function names such as cosh should be written in an upright 
font, not as $cosh ax$ as that can be interpreted as $c \cdot o \cdot s 
  \cdot h \cdot a \cdot x$

amsmath defines a lot of these function name shortcut such as \cosh, 
other can be defined uding

\DeclareMathOperator{\macroname}{Text}

Manual spaces can be inserted via \:,\, etc. But one should be a bit 
careful and think whether this is actually a good thing to do.

On the last page of my table of contents LaTeX seems to ignore
the bottom margin and it all runs off the bottom of the page.

It's as if it's treating the entire last page as a float.

Any thoughts?

I'm using tocloft class to try and improve the look but not
having much fun.

Does anyone have a model example for a nice TOC I can play
with please?

Cheers,

Andy

    * \! - a negative thin space 

Maybe a little bedtime manual reading would be a useful investment; for
example, the (17-page) Short Math Guide for LATEX by Michael Downes of the
American Mathematical Society or (a little weightier) The Not So Short
Introduction to LATEX2?.

might be a bit easier for us if you showed a minimal example of your

Thanks for reponse Lars,

I have discovered something that seems relevant, a correlation between
the main.toc file and the errant behaviour.

The book comprises 4 parts, theory, tools, technique and practicals.

Parts 1-3 are fine. These are very orthodox with sections, subsections
and so forth. They print fine in the TOC.

Part 4 is special, because each chapter follows exactly the same section
structure - Aims, Analysis, Methods, DSP code, Results, Conclusions etc.
Because of this I do not want the sections to show up, so I use 
\section*{} throughout.

I have elected to make the TOC depth to the sections level, which gives
the optimal information but no more. 

The result is that main.toc follows a traditional format 
Part 1
Chapter 1
Section 1
Subsection 1 ...
Section 2 ...

Chapter 2
Section 1 ...

Part 2 ...

(of course only the Parts, Chapters and Sections print in TOC)

all the way up to 

Part 4

but then there are no other entries deeper than chapter, so it continues

Chapter n
Chapter n+1
Chapter n+2 ...

Here is where the problem starts.

Latex doesn't want to split these over a page.

I'm considering some options such as trying to use

\addtocontents{toc}{\protect\newpage} to force a page break.

>From the tocloft manual

"You may get undesired page breaks in the ToC. For example you may have
long multiline section title and in the ToC there is a page break between
the lines. After your document is stable you can use \addtocontents at
appropriate places in the body of the document to adjust the page breaking
in the ToC."

QUESTION:

Is it a fair assumption that the .toc file effectively isolates the
TOC printing from any other prior code that produced it? If so
the problem seems related to the lack of any children to chapters.

Have I found a bug?

Is there a possible remedy like inserting some kind of invisible
child level to chapter in Part 4?

Thankyou for any thoughts,

Andy Farnell

Try these for sets, vectors etc

\\mathds{V}

I cannot say, I need to see what generates the .toc file, and thus have 
something I can run on my system.

Also I don;t know which class you are using, and what is \contentsfinish

and how does those lines appear.

Please create a minimal example that we can run, that produces the bad TOC.

$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}$ seems to work for me.

You could try something like this:

  \mbox{\boldmath\ensuremath{\mathcal{E}}}

Note that \mathbold should be used carefully:

  http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/teTeX/latex/latex2e-html/boldmath.html

To save some typing, I'd write a shortcut macro:

  \newcommand{\Evec}{\mbox{\boldmath\ensuremath{\mathcal{E}}}}

and use it like this:

  ``Our macro \Evec{} can be used in non-math mode or in math mode $\Evec$.''

Reeeeely stupid bug in tocloft's \l at part, which makes a 
local setting of \everypar

    \global\@nobreaktrue
    \everypar{\global\@nobreakfalse\everypar{}}

immediately followed by \endgroup (to erase the setting).
The effect is that any "part" entry in the TOC prevents
page breaks in the rest of the TOC.   The \endgroup should
be moved up to before \if at cfthaschapter.

Also, Herbert Voss' Math mode and the documentation of Morten  
H?gholm's mathtools package. In your terminal or Command Prompt,

texdoc mathmode mathtools <enter>

If you use Windows and MiKTeX, maybe you don't have Voss' Math mode,  
but you can get it here:

Try

  \hbox to 0.8em{\kern-0.06em\hbox to 0.901em{\cleaders \hbox to
0.225em{\hss.\hss}\hfill}\hss}%

in place of the question marks - it's a variation on the theme of \dotfill.

Subject: [texhax] nopagebreak \hline in a longtable
Message-ID: <79596f180810160039t1a17d70epb52808403d38173c@mail.gmail.com>

I use the longtable package for some very long tables I have, however
sometimes I want to rows to stay together even if it isn't ideal for
the layout. This is possible by using the \\* or a \nopagebreak at the
beginning of the row. This works fine if there is no \hline between
the two rows. At first I thought I'll try \nopagebreak\hline, but this
doesn't work. When I looked into the longtable package, it's seems
that this isn't working because \hline in longtable actually adds two
lines and the rows are split in between those two lines. So my guess
was that the only solution was to add a sort of \hline* command that
adds a line without the possibility of a pagebreak on that line. My
TeX knowledge however is far from sufficient to tackle such a hack as
I noticed. I was mostly guessing what would happen without any
certainty that what I was doing was right. So it's no surprise that I
didn't succeed.

My question is if anyone knows how to this, or could give me some
hints or knows a better way to achieve this effect.

a search google.groups ("hline longtable nopagebreak") gives this
solution:

\documentclass{article} 
\usepackage{longtable} 

\makeatletter 
\newcommand*{\nonbreakhline}{\cline{1-\LT at cols}} 
\makeatother 
\begin{document} 
\begin{longtable}{llll} 
links & mitte links & mitte rechts & rechts \\\nonbreakhline 
links & mitte links & mitte rechts & rechts \\*\nonbreakhline 
links & mitte links & mitte rechts & rechts \\ 
\end{longtable} 
\end{document}

Thanks, I had done several searches with slightly different keywords

Hi all,

I would like to fill a page with lines in an exam (exam.cls). This is a

Anyone know of a clever package that does this, or an even cleverer solution?

As long as the lines are only vertical and horizontal, anything can be
done directly in TeX, although the resulting text will not necessarily
be readable.  Example is in attachment.  Run

  $ tex layout
  $ xdvi layout

Best,

Subject: [texhax] sidecap + wrap
Message-ID: <200810161735.45487.holy@wustl.edu>

Hello,

I've been a LaTeX user for some time, but have never delved into hacking it 
before, and I'm quite a novice; please pardon my ignorance.

I'm writing a grant application with very limited space. To help save space, I 
want the figure captions to be as space efficient as possible. Since my 
captions tend to be long (they explain a lot of details about the figures), 
what I want is something like "sidecap", but that when the caption reaches 
the bottom of the figure, it then fills the entire available width. 
Schematically, if "F" indicates region occupied by figure, and "C" indicates 
region occupied by caption, then standard figures are like this:

        FFFFF
        FFFFF
        FFFFF
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
CCCCCCCCCC

(this email may be best viewed with a fixed-width font!) and sidecap gives you 
figures like this:

      CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
      CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
      CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
FFFFF CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
FFFFF CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
FFFFF CCCCCCCCCCCCC

(notice the blank space above the figure, because the caption is bigger than 
the figure) and what I want is this:

FFFFF CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
FFFFF CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
FFFFF CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC

It turns out that this effect isn't too hard to achieve, but the way I've done 
it requires a lot of manual tweaking; I can't help but think that there must 
be a better way.

Here's the really awful manual method:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\newcount\thisfigindentedlines
\newlength{\thisfigurewidth}
\newlength{\thiscaptionindent}
\newlength{\thisremaininglength}
\newlength{\captionsep}
\setlength{\captionsep}{0.15in}
\newlength{\extravspace}
\setlength{\extravspace}{-0.25in}

\newcommand{\setcaptionlengths}{
\setlength{\thiscaptionindent}{\thisfigurewidth}
\addtolength{\thiscaptionindent}{\captionsep}
\setlength{\thisremaininglength}{\columnwidth}
\addtolength{\thisremaininglength}{-\thiscaptionindent}
}

\begin{document}

This is a test document to see if I can develop a version of side-captioning 
that wraps any extra text around the bottom of a figure.

\def\thisfigureheight{1.25in}
\setlength{\thisfigurewidth}{3.5in}
\setcaptionlengths
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=\thisfigureheight]{gull}\quad
\includegraphics[height=\thisfigureheight]{tiger}
\vspace{-\thisfigureheight}
\vspace{\extravspace}
\caption{
\parshape=10 \thiscaptionindent \thisremaininglength \thiscaptionindent 
\thisremaininglength \thiscaptionindent \thisremaininglength 
\thiscaptionindent \thisremaininglength \thiscaptionindent 
\thisremaininglength \thiscaptionindent \thisremaininglength 
\thiscaptionindent \thisremaininglength \thiscaptionindent 
\thisremaininglength \thiscaptionindent \thisremaininglength 0pt \columnwidth
({\bf A}) A gull. This is a bird. It's a sea bird. You know, one that flies 
out over the ocean. I don't know much about gulls, so I don't know what more 
to say about them. {\bf B} A tiger. They're big. I hear they're friendly, at 
least when they don't intend to eat you. Certainly, they're really strong. 
They like water.
}
\end{figure}

\end{document}



Note the many ways that this solution could be improved:
1. I use the \parshape command with an explicit number of indented lines; but 
this seems silly, because I already have a variable that contains the height 
of the figure. It seems that I should be able to calculate the number of 
lines (from \thisfigureheight and \baselineskip) and then put this in a loop. 
But I'm not having any luck with a construct like this:

\def\parshapecmd{}
\loop\ifnum\thisfigindentedlines>1
  \advance\thisfigindentedlines by -1
  \def\parshapecmd{\parshapecmd \thiscaptionindent \thisremaininglength}
\repeat
\def\parshapecmd{\parshapecmd 0pt \columnwidth}

I just don't know enough TeX to know what's wrong with it.

2. At the end of the \includegraphics commands, it seems that there should be 
some way of knowing "where you are" (i.e., where the "cursor" is) so that you 
know both the height and width of the inserted graphics. That way, the user 
doesn't have to explicitly specify widths and heights.

I'm envisioning that this should be as easy as:

\def\thisfigureheight{1.25in} % needed only because there are 2 images
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=\thisfigureheight]{gull}\quad
\includegraphics[height=\thisfigureheight]{tiger}
\sidecapwrap{
({\bf A}) A gull....
}
\end{figure}

Can anyone offer advice?

Thanks,
--Tim

When trying this solution this morning I was surprised to see that it
has not the desired effect. It does indeed prohibit a line break on
the line, but does not keep the rows together.
Let me try it by giving a diagram. The original output was

PAGE 1:

row1
-------

PAGE 2:

-------
row2
-------
row3

And I want row1 and row 2 to stay together. After using this solution,
the result is

PAGE 1:

row1
-------

PAGE 2:

row2
-------
row3

So the only effect is that the line is no longer on two pages. The
desired effect however is

PAGE 1:

row1
-------
row2
-------

PAGE 2:

-------
row3

So maybe I'm more looking for something to group several rows and
disallow any break within that group.


Kind regards and thanks in advance for any help.

Subject: [texhax] index entries in verbatim text?
Message-ID: <96od1jjn91.fsf@mo.msk.ru>

In latex document have large (possibly spanning many pages) stretches
of verbatim text, something like program source, normally to be
written inside `verbatim' environment.  Index entries are to point to
locations in the middle of such text.

Is there a way to write `\index' commands to achieve this?

They certainly must not insert vertical spacing or otherwise alter the
printed appearance of verbatim text.  So the trivial way, splitting
`verbatim',

\begin{verbatim}
TEXT BEFORE
LINE TO POINT TO
\end{verbatim}
\index{KEY}
\begin{verbatim}
TEXT AFTER
\end{verbatim}

does not work.  Between these `verbatim' environments vertical spacing
is inserted.  It does not look like just

\begin{verbatim}
TEXT BEFORE
LINE TO POINT TO
TEXT AFTER
\end{verbatim}

`\verb' command refuses to process multiple- line stretches of text.
So at best have to use it on each and every line of text to format.
This certainly allows to put `\index' command at arbitrary point
without breaking anything.

And this is also not for regular use.  Not only such a `\verb' quoting
tedious and error- prone.  The text to be formatted verbatim is
generally program code, its language may be pretty hairy, may use just
any character, so selecting quote character for `\verb' command is
hard to automate.

`alltt' environment is checked to be useless.  `\index' in it is
ignored, leaves nothing in index.  (Inclined to consider this a bug of
the `alltt' package, defeating the very purpose of it.)

Is there environment like `verbatim' that one can split arbitrarily so
that `\index' will point to arbitrary line in it?

Try the listings package. It allows to escape to tex from within the typeset listing, so you could do something like (untested:)

\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=\%]
..
..
..
.. %\index{key}%
..
..
..
\end{lstlisting}

Please see whether this helps:

   \usepackage{fancyvrb}

   \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\|\[\]]
   TEXT BEFORE
   LINE TO POINT TO|index[KEY]
   TEXT AFTER
   \end{Verbatim}

Note that here the default escape character \ is changed to | and the 
default argument delimiters  { and } are changed to [ and ] using 
"commandchars". You can use any other characters (including the default 
ones) for these as long as they don't appear in the verbatim text.

Maybe is the space (\right])? Or maybe your equation is in two or more  
lines?

See a short introduction to LaTeX

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/

in several languages.

Also,

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/math/voss/mathmode/Mathmode.pdf

(pages 29 and 62 about \right. and \left. for multiline equations).

please provide a minimal example displaying the problem. There can be a 
number of reasons, so it is a lot easier for us to help, is you show 
some code.

Please remember that this DOES NOT WORK:

\begin{align*}
  f(x) ={} & \left[   blah blah
  \\
          + blah balh \right]
\end{align*}

you cannot have a \left and a \right on different lines like that. In

Yes, see pages 29 and 62-63 of Mathmode.pdf. Also, if your language is

Before I downgraded my computer to XP, I did get TeX working on it.  I 
think I had to make myself super-user (just being administrator wasn't 
enough) and I first installed TeX-Live 2007 which ran but couldn't display 
or print since it didn't have permission to write fonts.  (It is possible 
that I did this before realizing I had to make myself super-user; this was 
a year and a half ago).  Then I installed Miktex, v. 2.7 and that 
installed and ran without difficulty.  Still I had enough problems with 
Vista ("find" never found anything, for example) that I downgraded and am 
happy with that decision.

That's just it.  There is (generally) no such characters at all.
ASCII ones, at least.

That is, for escaping to LaTeX to be useful in this case, it has to be
possible to specify for it a substring pattern much more complex than
just encountering some fixed character.  The task is very much like
that of selecting, generating `boundary' (attribute) value for
multipart MIME entity, of which each body part may contain arbitrary
text.  And the set, syntax of allowed patterns has to be at least that
general.

Perhaps will (in my copious free time) even write such a feature
request to maintainers of packages we tried here.

Hi,
I'm a beginner with LaTex, and I'm preparing an article to submit to Elsevier. So I'm using the elsarticle document class. Well when I include the \begin{abstract}, and \begin{keyword} nothing happens, nor even an error, but nothing different appears were it should be.
Something similar occurs with the e-mail addresses of the preamble, they don't appear in footnote. I've already consulted the general and specific documentations. Furthermore the elsdoc (the specific documentation) says that the \begin{abstract} and \begin{keywords} must be in the preamble, it looks like wrong to me, ad when I do that I get an error.

Well, I wasn't able to find a correspondence list to write to, so I'm as king for help here, but I know that probably the wrong way to do that... Any way I'll appreciate if someone could help me.

Thank you fot the patience and attention!

Why didn't you use the templates they provide?  If you do that, you get the
following, which works.

I'm not sure I really understand, but maybe somethng like this is what you
want:

\begin{align}
constraint1 \nonumber \\
& \hspace{2 cm} \forall k
\end{align}

Anyway, since you are using "amsmath" and its "align" environment, why not
also read its (rather good) manual and find out just what "align" is for and
how it works?

Cheers,  Phil

I am using the memoir document class for a book and would like to control
or eliminate the large vertical blank area at the beginning of each new
chapter.

I have been using a custom chapter style to eliminate unwanted chapter
numbering.  My current chapterstyle code which merely eliminates unwanted
numbering is as follows.

\makechapterstyle{nonumber}{%
    \renewcommand{\printchaptername}{}
    \renewcommand{\printchapternum}{ }
}

How can I modify this code or something else to control the large vertical
blank area at the beginning of each new chapter?

Message-ID: <8FECCE508EA1784EA6DCA8F062318BD1041FDA4D@mail-x.del.techbooks.com>

Dear Sir,

 

We are working on UNIX platform and using TeTeX.

 

My chapter has 3 GB of arts. When I am creating the ps file using dvips
command, we are not getting the complete ps file. Sometimes, it is
creating 2 GB .ps file and sometimes only 1 GB.

 

Can you please help me resolving this issue. The command I am using to
create .ps file is

 

dvips -j0 -G0 -Ppdf filename

 

Thanks in advance for all your help.

A week ago one of our posdocs encountered the similar problem with
1,000,000 dvi file and dying dvips (he had me think twice as big
file). However pdflatex worked well; may be it will work for you too
(if your art is in ps or eps you can convert it in pdf).

Subject: [texhax] page breaking figures
Message-ID: <20081023185502.GA30262@piper.oerlikon.madduck.net>

Hi folks,

I need to include 2.5 pages of text as a figure in a document.
Unfortunately, if I wrap it into a 'figure' environment, there won't
be page breaks, because 'figure' is a float and floats are designed
to be just that: non-breaking.

In general, I don't care about the text being in a 'figure'
environment, nor where it appears (I am happy to let it appear right
where I have it in the source), but what I do want/need are
a \caption and a \label with the same semantics as if I used them
within a 'figure' environment.

I looked across the Web and in the books I have, but without
success. Could anyone possibly let me know how to do either of

  - make figure floats break across multiple pages
  - simulate non-floating figures?

I found the nonfloat package, which promises to do the latter, but
it appears overly complex, and the examples use minipages, which
have the same problem: they won't break across pages, right?

Any clues?

All,

When using the "srt" bibliography style to get numbered references, is there
a way to get consecutive numbers to print e.g. [1,2,3,4], or [1-4], instead
of  [1],[2],[3],[4]?

As shown in \cite{Pinheiro/Bates:2000},\cite{Verbeke/Molenberghs:2000},

It may be that your particular flavor of Unix limits file size to 2 GB.

Actually, after a good night's sleep, everything seems a bit easier:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\usepackage{nonfloat}
\begin{document}
\VerbatimInput[frame=lines,framesep=1em,label={[Begin of file]End of file}]{/etc/services}
\figcaption{The file /etc/services}
\end{document}

I'd still prefer if there was a caption on every page, and on the
top of every page there was a continuation notice, but this will do
for now.

If anyone has a better idea, please let me know!

You might get more consistent results with a single \cite command, i.e.,


\cite{Pinheiro/Bates:2000,Verbeke/Molenberghs:2000,Gelman:2007,Bryk/Raudenbush:1992}.

\makeatletter

thereafter, any isolated \captions will be interpreted as 
figure captions.

Yeah, that was part of the problem: there are too many options, and
none do what I want.

I now have an acceptable solution using float and caption. Note
that with a newer caption package, \DeclareCaptionType replaces the
need for the float package entirely.

See the attached file.

The "solution" does not work with hyperref. As soon as I use the
name passed to \label{} in a \ref{}, latex runs fine for one
invocation, bitches about unresolved references, asks me to rerun,
but as soon as I do, it dies:

  ! Undefined control sequence.
  <argument> email.\theHemail 

on the line of the \ref{}. Thoughts?

Maybe, maybe not:

More information is needed:  Which Unix, which shell, and so on.
Is it possible to install Bash?  The latter would make it easier to
reproduce the problem on other systems.

Message-ID: <19af81400810250431k271a2196l4712c4f0580f5d5a@mail.gmail.com>

With documentclass memoir I have a couple of questions:


1) I use concise and detailed toc

\setcounter{tocdepth}{0}
\tableofcontents*
\dominitoc
\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}
\tableofcontents*

However how I can change the name of toc in the first case from
Contents  to "Short Contents" ?

2) Some lines in the toc are too long and they are broken only when
the whole width of the text area is covered like

Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah
Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah
Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah
                                      123

while I want to break them automatically as

Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah
Blah   Blah
Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah   Blah
                                123

Is it possible? Can I specify the length of the toc line (excluding
page numbers)?

3) Just if someone remembers: what is a correct order

\chapter[toc title][header title]{title}

or

\chapter[header title][toc title]{title}

and for \section - how one can insert [minitoc title] (if it is
possible to make it distinct from [toc title]


Thank you very much in advance

Victor

they are governed by what is left over from the left number area plus

Subject: [texhax] Wrong unnumbered subsections position in ToC
Message-ID: <200810271051.38602.freitas@engebras.com.br>

Hello,

I'm using the tocloft package to change the table of
contents of my document. All entries in the ToC must
be left aligned, everything is ok except the unnumbered
subsections (\subsection*). Below is the code that I'm
using to do this:

\usepackage[titles]{tocloft}
...
\cftsetindents{chapter}(0cm}{1.5cm}
\cftsetindents{section}(0cm}{1.5cm}
\cftsetindents{subsection}(0cm}{1.5cm}

Here is the result:

1        Chapter                                     1
1.1     Section                                      1
1.1.1  Subsection                                1
Unnumbered subsection                     1
Glossary                                              2

What I'm trying to do is something like this:

1        Chapter                                     1
1.1     Section                                      1
1.1.1  Subsection                                1
          Unnumbered subsection           1
Glossary                                              2

Can anyone help me?

Thanks.

Hello,

The question came up of how TeX plays friendly with make and incremental 
compiling. That is, a whole TeX project must be re-built if any 
component changes or is simply "touched."

Do any tools exist to create the equivalent of a .o object file that is 
re-liked to the larger work? Else, has anyone ever voiced concern about 
this and proposed a solution?

Thanks,

No. LaTeX has \include and \includeonly.

I have commented out my custom chapter style based on the memoir class and
used the following code based on the titlesec package.  My question about
modifying this or some other code remains.

\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\filcenter\sc\Huge}{\thechapter}{0pt}{}{}

[...]

I hope the following minimal but full LaTeX document is sufficiently
minimal while full enough to demonstrate the issue.

Look at how the table of contents page title, "CONTENTS", appears at a
higher point on the page than chapter titles.  Before modifying the table
of contents title with the tocloft package using the following code, the
table of contents title had appeared at a lower point on the page much
more like the chapter titles.

\def\tableofcontents{\section*{\centering CONTENTS}\@starttoc{toc}}

Chapter titles in the minimal LaTeX document are "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "THE
HOUSE OF MAPUHI", and "THE WHALE TOOTH".

This should be doable --- make a change to one chapter, process only  
that chapter, then process the entire book once --- the difficult part  
would be tracking the number of pages in a given chapter and then  
processing all following chapters if the number of pages changes.

There is latexmk --- have you looked at it?

Subject: [texhax] Paper size issues with RevTeX in combination with pdfTeX...
Message-ID: <20081028041522.GP18248@cpe-67-241-17-133.twcny.res.rr.com>

Hi,

I know paper-size questions are somewhat scorned, but I'm having
difficulty with this issue (after a number of hours of investigation).
I've searched both the texhax and pdfTeX-specific mailing lists for
this, as well as Google's cache in general, but to no avail.  My setup
is based upon teTeX 2.0.2c-8 on Debian 3.1, but I suspect the
situation is similar in newer TeX distributions as well.

RevTeX4 allows one to specifically define the papersize as an option
to the class:

  \documentclass[letterpaper]{revtex4}

This works fine for me when compiling with the LaTeX -> dvips ->
ps2pdf route.  However, it does not work for me with pdfTeX.  Instead,
that compilation route seems to instead extract page size from the
options in '/etc/texmf/pdftex/pdftex.cfg' (similar to
'/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/generic/config/pdftexconfig.tex' in a
newer texlive distribution in Debian 4.0), which is not editable by
non-root users, and thus a non-ideal solution for correcting this in
general.

I'm well aware that the standard solution would be to include the
'geometry' package and then specify the size directly in the LaTeX
source. Unfortunately, 'geometry' greatly munges RevTeX's layout, and
thus is not a solution that would still allow for APS journal
submission.

I greatly appreciate any guidance.

Thanks kindly,
Daniel

Hi,

Well, I think I mostly have this figured out on my own. However, my solution 
required that I write my own caption-generating macro, which looks like this:

\newcommand{\captiontext}[1]{\refstepcounter{figure}
{\captionfont {\captionlabelfont \figurename~\thefigure: }#1}
}

This works for figures, but is there a way to make a generic macro that works 
for figures, tables, and any other floats? I've spent quite some time looking 
through caption.sty for inspiration, but so far I can't get this to work 
properly.

Best,
--Tim

Michael,

  > From: Michael Dexter <dexter at bsdfund.org>
  > Subject: [texhax] TeX and make
  > The question came up of how TeX plays friendly with make and incremental 
  > compiling. 

This question comes up regularly.  There are two answers:

1. LaTeX (we don't use TeX per se) on a useful but 8-year old server
   can process one of our books, 750 pages long, in
   36 seconds.  In fact this involves running LaTeX three times
   (for indexing reasons), so it's typesetting 60 pages/second.
   (Even more, in fact, because the 36s includes index processing,
   which is done twice.)
   On a recent laptop it runs at twice this speed, say 100pp/s,
   and on a fast new server you might get twice this again.

   This high speed means that in practice you don't need subsidiary
   .o files or the like for normal typesetting tasks.  It would be
   *nice* to have something like that, but given that the hardware
   is continually removing the imperative, I don't think it's likely.

2. In the Old Days, when running on Sun 3/50's and the like, it
   *was* necessary to divide LaTeX processing into chunks.  Here's
   how we did it.  The same approach works today.  It means you
   can typically process a chapter (30 pages, say) in less than a second.

	- Treat each chapter as a separate document.  You glue
	  the individual PDFs together at the end, to form
	  the complete book.

	- Run LaTeX on each chapter, to get an estimate of
	  its extent (i.e. no. of pages in it).

	- Compile a table of start page numbers for each 
	  chapter.  (We combined this with other definitions
	  for each chapter, so we could easily move chapters
	  within the book.)  Here's an example.
	  (See www.uit.co.uk/latex/latex-and-make-example.tex
	  for a longer example.)

	\definechap{TOOLKITS}{6}{149}{Look and Feel --- Toolkits}{`Look And Feel' Part 1 --- Toolkits for Application Programs}

	  This is Chap 6, and it starts on p149.  (\definechap
	  is our own macro.)

	- We used Imake to reduce the tedium of writing
	  the dependencies for each Make target, i.e. for
	  each chapter.

   Then we could say, e.g. "make TOOLKITS", to
   LaTeX that chapter, and incorporate the necessary
   bits of TOOLKITS.aux and TOOLKITS.idx etc. into the overall
   .aux and .idx, for cross-refs, indexing, etc.

   The obvious problem here is that tracking page numbers is manual.
   While tedious, this was unimportant in real life.  (a) By the time you're anywhere
   near a final draft of a book, your material is very stable, and pagination
   is unlikely to change.  (b) Even if it does, changing the table isn't a
   big deal.  But I'm sure it could be automated by programmers cleverer
   than me.

The following is taken from typearea.sty (koma-script):

\AtBeginDocument{\scr at ifpdfoutput{\pdfpagewidth=\paperwidth\pdfpageheight=\paperheight}{\AtBeginDvi{\special{papersize=\the\paperwidth,\the\paperheight}}}}

I suspect you will have to make sure all those commands are availlable (or
substituted), but perhaps that helps towards your goal.

Sorry that my last few changes were not reported by LyX at compile time. 
Apparently my attempt to cheat and load the tocloft package after memoir
had loaded its tocloft emulation merely temporarily fooled error catching
when compiling with LyX.

I have corrected the errors and tested on the command line.  Any advice
about creating blank lines without triggering the underfull \hbox badness
warnings would be appreciated.

My new attempt to demonstrate the issue for my original question follows.

[..]

I have commented out my custom chapter style based on the memoir class and
used the following code based on the titlesec package.  My question about
modifying this or some other code remains.

\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\filcenter\sc\Huge}{\thechapter}{0pt}{}{}

[...]

Look at how the table of contents page title, "CONTENTS", appears at a
higher point on the page than chapter titles.  Before modifying the table
of contents title using the following code, the table of contents title
had appeared at a lower point on the page much more like the chapter
titles.

\def\tableofcontents{\section*{\centering CONTENTS}\@starttoc{toc}}

Chapter titles in the minimal LaTeX document are "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "THE
HOUSE OF MAPUHI", and "THE WHALE TOOTH".

The following code may also be downloaded for the next month from

I suspect the redefinition of the table of contents, it uses \section* 
while the others use \chapter

could I ask you to describe exactly how you cwant the chapterstyle to 
look like, then I'll have a go such that we can eliminate at least titlesec

Just to be clear, my personal preference is to have an aesthetically
pleasing amount of white space for maximising readability.  However, I am
instructed to do whatever can be reasonably managed to reduce the total
page count by increasing the number of lines of text on a page wherever
possible.  The preamble being tested for production text has 11 point type
and a 10% reduction in space between lines to aid in the page count.  I
have done my best to avoid any extremely unpleasant consequences of that
thinking.

An aid in this effort would be a means to reduce the space between the top
of the page and the chapter title for the first page of chapters. 
Allowing even a few lines on the first page of a chapter can save a couple
of pages if the last page of the chapter is an odd numbered page with only
a few lines of text followed by a blank even numbered page.

I want to be able to arbitrarily control the space above a chapter title
on the first page of a chapter.  I do not want to loose the ability to
control the presence or absence of chapter labels such as with the word
'Chapter', numbering, font size, weight, and horizontal alignment for
chapter titles.  For the project I have at the moment, chapter titles
which have no 'Chapter' labels, no numbers, \Huge sized fonts, normal
weight, and centred horizontal alignment are preferred.  However, I hope
to avoid losing the ability to control those elements to gain control over
the vertical placement of chapter titles.

Currently I am using titlesec to control font size, weight, and horizontal
alignment of chapter titles using the following command.

\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\filcenter\scshape\Huge}{\thechapter}{0pt}{}{}

I have equivalent uses of \titleformat for part and section.  I do not
want to loose the control provided as a consequence of eliminating
titlesec.

Below is my version without the use of titlesec or titletoc

I removed the use of \chapter*, \addcontentsline and \markboth, since 
that just adds unnecessary extra typing that are not needed if the 
document is designed correctly.

Thanks for the suggestion.  It definitely led me down the right road.
Unfortunately, RevTeX appears to make things a little more
complicated.  The above didn't work.  The following, however, did
(hopefully, reproducing it here might help others who would later
search for a similar solution):

\ifpdf
\pdfpagewidth=8.5 true in
\pdfpageheight=11 true in
\fi

Obviously, this also requires inclusion of the 'ifpdf' package.  The
problem with the initial suggestion appears to stem from the fact that
\paperwidth and \paperheight don't contain meaningful values when the
document is processed using the RevTeX class.  If I use the TeX
commands \showthe to pause compilation and display their values, they
both show 0. (Not sure what this means, but I doubt it's good, as they
should show appropriate letter-sized values, I'd think...)  Thus, I'm
forced to explicitly use the letter size above in defining them.

Anyway, thank you again,
Daniel

Thank you very much.  Apparently, I will need to upgrade to memoir 
1.61803 to use the new easy customisation commands which have been
included in the style suggestions from Lars Madsen.

I expect I will acquire the upgraded memoir automatically when I replace
my current Debian GNU/Linux etch stable packaged version of TeX Live 2005
with the new standard TeX Live 2008 distribution.  I already had needed to
upgrade LaTeX completely to avoid upstream LaTeX line breaking bugs
involving fonts for some punctuation which have been trapped in Debian
etch from the point when Debian etch package development was frozen in
preparation for stable release.

I will wait until upgrading in a couple of weeks or so to read more about
the new memoir commands.

if you have the space you can have both TL2005 and TL2008 side by side.

I have to say that the new TL2008 is very cool, including online update.

TL2005, is VERY old.

If you are writing about Nuclear Institute I was there few times in
the late 80-ties and it was a fun to see how attitude of security
there provided by KGB went from rather strict to completely lame. In
the last my visit the checkpoint was decorated by a big billboard with
a lot of notes describing KGB crimes.

On the separate note: in the 70ties in backpacking camping I and
friends took few times some route on the Southern Ural with very
narrow rail (much more narrow than the standard European leave alone
wider Russian one). Train was going only once a day, and in one
direction it started before dawn. It was cold (jackets and sweaters
were worn) and dark and a lot of fog but later it was becoming warmer
and few hours later we were just in T-shorts sitting near open doors
and some even had their legs outside sometimes touching the tall
grass; door were very wide since the coaches were both for passengers
and cargo. Train was  very short and went very slowly, human could
overrun it in the short run. There were only very few passengers and
it seems that all of them except us knew one another (despite
traveling separately).

This is not typical train in Russia.

15 years later few villages there were devastated by the flood and
tens of people were killed: there were few artificial lakes used to
retain river water for use in metallurgy and levees were not strong
enough to resist high water

Subject: [texhax] A new question not in the TeX FAQ
Message-ID: <1225455891.15196.350.camel@dezsolaptop>

Dear TeXhax,

I am an associate professor at the Budapest University of Technology and
Economics, using (and also teaching) LaTeX, and I have the following
question which I have not been able to find any explanation up to now:

inside the \label statement, it is not possible to use the \usebox
command. It is quite strange, since any other commands can be used
there. I show the code which helped me to discover the problem:

\newsavebox{\tabcaption}
\newsavebox{\tablabel}
\newenvironment*{tabl}[3]% #1: caption, #2: label, #3: columns
{\begin{table}[htb]%
\sbox{\tabcaption}{#1}\sbox{\tablabel}{tab:#2}\center%
\begin{tabular}{#3}}
{\end{tabular}
\caption{\usebox{\tabcaption}}\label{\usebox{\tablabel}}
\end{table}}

This is just a new environment, which would ease the usage of tabular
inside table environments, e.g.

\begin{tabl}{Wise statements}{wise}{c|r@{,}l}
Expression & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Value} \\
\hline
$\pi$ & 3&1415927 \\
$\pi^\pi$ & 36&46216 \\
$\pi^{\pi^\pi}$ & 80662&666
\end{tabl}

The problem is that ``tabl'' does not work: during compilation, it
says: 

! Missing \endcsname inserted.
<to be read again> 
                   \unhbox 
l.15 ... \voidb at x \copy \tabcimke \relax }{{5}{3}}


I have found a workaround though: if I declare a new command which
stores the label and I use this command inside the \label statement, it
works (the .aux file must be deleted, of course):

\newcommand{\tablabel}{} % we will redefine this command later
\newsavebox{\tabcaption}
\newenvironment*{tabl}[3]% #1: caption, #2: label, #3: columns
{\begin{table}[htb]%
\sbox{\tabcaption}{#1}\renewcommand{\tablabel}{tab:#2}\center%
\begin{tabular}{#3}}
{\end{tabular}
\caption{\usebox{\tabcaption}}\label{\tablabel}
\end{table}}

This works (it compiles smoothly).
But why \usebox does not work inside \label?
Many thanks in advance for your feedback.

Standard answers regarding \caption:
- remember that the argument of \caption is normally fragile
- check the caption package

Also: \label takes a label, not text to be typeset!

Subject: [texhax] hyperref : bookmarks pointing into table of contents
Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.64.0810311703580.211@bryan-lepores-powerbook-g4-12.local>

it seems there is no documented way to get bookmarks (as from the hyperref 
package) to point to e.g. the \listoftables, which shows up in the table 
of contents ... so you can quickly jump to the list of tables instead of 
paging through.

am i right?  any pointers on how to make that happen appreciated.
