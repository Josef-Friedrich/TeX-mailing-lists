Hi,

I am trying to write up my resume, I wonder if there is a latex class for
the resume better than the one provided in the latex distribution. I see a
lot of resumes online which are very stylish though are in done in latex.
Any help will be extremely appreciated.

Best regards.

I use the moderncv class that's available on CTAN.  It has an example file 
that will help get you started.

    Firstly, my thanks to those who have provided input to this question,
    and my apologies for those of you who have been distracted by it.

it's really a rather nasty problem to get
something that's both robust and works in
all possible situations.

i think no one has mentioned that this is
built in to the amsthm package, for which
it is automatically dropped in at the end
of the proof environment.  (thus it is not
a standalone solution.)  there is also the
enhancement \qedhere which can be used when
a proof ends with either a list or a display
when the box normally drops down to a line
by itself (but always flush right).  by
putting \qedhere as the last thing within
the list or display environment, the box
is brought up to the final line; this does
require the use of left-hand equation
numbers (the default for ams document
classes).  the code is pretty nasty, but
comments in amsclass.dtx (from which amsthm
and the documentclasses are generated) are
helpful.  all this is due to michael downes,
to whom we owe a great deal.

Thanks Barabar. You've now nearly scared me off this task completely.
But I've learned in the process that what I tried to do using \eqno
works in TeX-style display math $$...$$ but throws a bad math delimiter
error with \[ \] and a "you can't use \eqno in math mode" :-) in
\begin{equation} ... \end{equation} constructs [it's the equation
numbering implicit \eqno that throws this - because the first \eqno has
changed the mode to a non-display math mode]. Interestingly, pressing s
to ignore the errors and press on yields the desired results, with latex
doing what it needs to fix things. As predicted, with ordinary equation
numbers the result is not great, as my marks and the equation number are
typeset one after the other, but using leqno yields (apart from the
error message) exactly what is desired. (including pushing my marks to
the next line if the equation is too long).

So here's my "final" version:

\newcommand{\qmarks}[1]{\ifmmode \eqno \hbox{[#1~qmarks]} \else
\pushright{\hbox{\quad[#1~qmarks]}}\fi}

This, combined with leqno, covers everything I need, with the nuisance
of throwing errors.

So, is there a way for me to trap the errors myself and ignore them? I
realise this is (a) very bad style (b) probably taboo (c) unaesthetic.
But the real programmers and the hackers live side-by-side in harmony
most of the time.

Warm wishes,
Steve

Apparently you're using pdftex, but including some sort of PostScript  
graphics on a system which doesn't seem to support the shell-escape  
technique of automatically converting them (this may be a mis- 
configuration, I'm not sure what capabilities miktex has in this  
regard).

In lieu of that you'll need to distill the .eps figures to pdfs so  
that they can be included, or switch to generating a dvi, then using  
dvips to generate PostScript, then using GhostScript or some other  
tool to distill that to a .pdf.

If one can use environments instead of inserting macros (I like 
environments), then one might use something like this

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[amsmath,thmmarks]{ntheorem}

\theoremstyle{empty} % no header
\theoremsymbol{xxx} % just a dummy
\newtheorem{innerenv}{Dummy} % header not used anyway
\makeatletter
\newenvironment{test}[1][]{%
   \protected at xdef\innerenvSymbol{\quad\textup{[#1]}}%
   \begin{innerenv}}{\end{innerenv}}
\makeatother
\begin{document}

\begin{test}[5~marks]
   \[
   3^2+4^2 = ?
   \]
\end{test}

\begin{test}[15~marks]
   \input tufte
\end{test}

\end{document}


only problem is that if a paragraph ends before \end{test}, either via a 
blank line or via the use of \par, then the placement engine breaks down.

Note that the math stuff requires a few passes.

The above have the advantage that it can be used with align etc. which 
your qmarks cannot.

1) Someone sent me a Latex source file containing a text with 
mathematical equations. That provided motivation for becoming familiar 
with reading tex files, and possibly start creating and typesetting my 
own. I have zero experience with this, except reading some tutorials 
found by Google.

2) I have an emac computer with the Mac OS-10.3.9 This morning I 
downloaded and installed TexShop, version 2.14. It is supposed to work 
with OS-10.3. All went smoothly; the TexShop application icon is on my 
dock. I opened the application and pasted into it's window a short tex 
file with equations. Then I pressed the TYPEST button, expecting to see 
the equations in the output window.

3) But produced the following error message:

/usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current/pdflatex does not 
exist. Perhaps teTeX was not installed or was removed during a system 
upgrade. If so, go to the TeXShop web site and follow the instructions 
to (re)install teTeX. Another possibility is that a tool path is 
incorrectly configured in TeXShop preferences. This can happen if you 
are using the fink teTeX distribution.

4) What should I do to succeed? I am a very unsophisticated Mac user; 
please be as specific as you can. Ideally, I would prefer to be guided 
during a telephone conversation. If this is possible I would be happy 
to call you, if the telephone number is provided in the reply to this 
message.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [texhax] Curly brackets in alltt environment
Message-ID: <477E7ACE.9070209@psych.uib.no>

I am writing a text where I want to include some snippets of source 
code (actually R).  This means that I have to be able to include 
brackets of the {} type.

In the verbatim environment they are simply not printed.  When using 
the alltt package they can be printed by using \{ and \}, but then 
they look a little too large (the size of the tt font is set by 
\small) compared to the rest of the text.  A third alternative I have 
tried is to use the listings package, but that gives me a different 
font from the other snippets.

Any suggestions?

I would strongly recommend the listings package for all listings. You
can change the font sing

\lstset{basicstyle=...}

where your preferred font selection goes on the dots.

Message-ID: <003f01c84f15$09841de0$4001a8c0@biggus>

Hey,

I was advised to use LModern a few months back and I'm happy with it
apart from, in my verbatims, the single quote character, which normally
in typewriter fonts comes out as a vertical dash, comes out as a
`floating comma', if you see what I mean. Is there a workaround, or will
I have to find another font for my verbatims? I'm using the fancyvrb
package (again on recommendation), by the way.

Kind regards,

James

Single quote characters are always a problem if you want to typeset
computer code.  It is absolutely necessary that /quoteleft and
/quoteright can be distinguished easily.  This is not always the case
because font designers often prefer "typographic quotes" which are
actually commas.

I don't know whether Jacko, the father of lmodern is on this list, so
I added him to the CC.  The lack of cleary distinguishable (also at
low resolution) single quotes is a pity.  Jacko, is it possible to
create such glyphs halfways easily?  I always considered to make Latin
Modern Teletype as a default font for my xterms and for Emacs but I
hesitated because it's currently very difficult to distinguish between
/quoteleft and /quoteright.

 > Is there a workaround, or will I have to find another font for my

Unfortunately there are not many typewriter fonts available at all.
And there is nothing better today than Latin Modern.

There are several variants of "Courier" available.  But see:

  http://ms25.ath.cx/courier.pdf

URW Courier (red) is compared with IBM Courier donated to X11 (blue).
This looks like a joke but it's real life.

  Reinhard

I suggest you to download Prof. Gr?tzer's Short Course (the free  
first part of his ``More Math into LaTeX'', 4th ed.) in

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Math_into_LaTeX-4/

Did you install the whole MacTeX package or just TeXShop? See

http://www.tug.org/mactex/

If you installed MacTeX, the path to binaries in TeXShop ->  
Preferences -> Engine should be

/usr/texbin

In Terminal.app you can type

which latex

hit return, and if TeX & Friends are installed you should get

/usr/texbin/latex

I advise you to join the TeX on Mac OS X mailing list:

http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/main.shtml#Mailinglist

Shouldn't lquote and rquote be something different from the straight-up 
single "quote"?

In the two courier fonts I can see on my vanilla OpenOffice (admittedly 
they are TTF, and I don't know where they come from) U+0027 is a single 
vertical typewriter "quote"

In the font called Courier 10 pitch, the paired single quotes are in 
U+0060 and U+00B4.
"B4 would be in the range of a 256-char TFM.

AFAIK Lamport did a talk on LaTeX 4 at a TUG conference in the early
90s. I've been told it wasn't serious. :-)

Reinhard, Pierre, hi,

thanks for the replies.

As far as I can tell, straight down single quotes are 0027 and then
there are two opposing single quotes 0060 and 00b4. When I cut and paste
0027 from Windows character map into my tex file and texify, however,
00b4 seems to get rendered. Try:

+++

\usepackage{lmodern}

\begin{verbatim}
'''
\end{verbatim}

+++

Is this not then a problem with encoding? 

I recall that \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} fixed the problem of brackets
being rendered wrongly in Latin modern. Compare...

+++

\usepackage{lmodern}
%\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\begin{verbatim}
{}
\end{verbatim}

+++

...with or without the fontenc line commented out. Is there not a
similar "fix" for single quotes? There seems to be no documentation for
fontenc, so I'm stuck.

Or is the glyph for 0027 drawn like 00b4 rather than just straight down?

My small brain hurts.

Best,

James

P.S. Having typed 'latin modern glyphs' and 'latin modern typewriter
glyphs' into google and followed a few links to the explanatory pdfs on
tug.org and other places, I was absolutely astonished by the work that's
gone into Latin Modern. 

I just wanted to make it clear that in my last post, I wasn't
"complaining", it's just that my mind was boggling.

I have tried to digest some of the content of these articles but I'm not
making progress, I still can't work out whether there's some \quoteXXX
to pair off with 0027 in the same way that \quoteleft and \quoteright
pair off with 0060 and 00b4, for example.

Kind regards,

James

Hi Pierre,
in program code the straght-up single quote is fine for the ASCII
character 27(hex) because it is used in a similar way as the
straight-up double quote ASCII 22(hex), for example

echo '$var'  or print 'x'

However, the left quote should be clearly different.  For instance

echo `cat /etc/HOSTNAME`

I would agree with rquote to be different from the straight-up single
quote if there were many situations where quotations are done like
`this' but this is very uncommon in program code.  Of course, I speak
about typewriter fonts only and I assume that they are used for
typesetting program code only.

James, according to the PostScript reference, there are the following
characters.

27 /quoteright
60 /quoteleft
b4 /acute
-- /quotesingle
89 /grave

However, Adobe puts /quoteleft into slot 60 while ISO specifies /grave.
/quotesingle exists in Adobe StandardEncoding but not in ISO-8859-1.

I don't know whether everything needed is in the LM fonts, but I think
it is.  Then it should be possible to make a customized copy of the
encoding vector where /quoteleft is replaced by /grave and /quoteright
by /quotesingle.   

Though I'm very interested in these things as well I don't have much
time at the moment for own experiments.  What I still don't know is
whether /grave is useful.  Designed as an accent rather than as a quote
it might be too small.  But you could try, at least.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hey all,

got it, a rare triumph. Article here...

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html

Great stuff! Somewhere in there there's a link to here:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/upquote/upquote.st
y

+++

\RequirePackage{textcomp}

\begingroup
\catcode`'=\active               
\catcode``=\active               
\g at addto@macro\@noligs
   {\let`\textasciigrave
    \let'\textquotesingle}
\endgroup

+++

And \usepackage{upquote} loads fine and does indeed allow me to use the
apostrophe 0027 in my verbatims. The package was written for CModern but
works for LModern, too, with and without T1 encoding.

Thanks all for your help.

Kind regards,

James

This works fine for me too.  Now I have to find out what I have to do
in order to achive the same in my script written in plain TeX which I
use for program listings.  I have no time to look into it at the
moment but it's very good to know that everything I need is already
available.

Since I updated my version of TeX, I have been getting the following  
error message (which the same source code never generated before):
******************************************************

********************************************************
For a book manuscript, I have quotations in several languages  
including latin, so I have the following call to babel:
\usepackage[german, greek, french, latin, italian, english]{babel}

When I simply go past the error message while typesetting, nothing  
untoward appears to happen, but it is a nuisance.  What can I do to  
stop it?

Hmm, this does look like an oversight in the basic LaTeX file and I would
expect that someone else already has a solution (the same problem arises for
any sectioning command that does not provide a number (as in the use of
\paragraph below without my hack).  The problem seems to be the space
inserted between the chapter/section number and the title even when the
latter is absent.

Nonono. It is the space between the title and the paragraph text.
Furthermore, the title is not "absent":  It happens to be a null
string of text, but that is different from there being no title at all.

The space may have been unwanted, but it is not unexpected.  The
user should have done his section differently.

Quite right, my mistake.

Well, that may be the way LaTeX sees it but the naive (not an insult,
please!) user doesn't necessarily interpret things the same way and, indeed,
some macros do in fact thoughtfully check for "null strings" and make
adjustments accordingly.

> The space may have been unwanted, but it is not unexpected.  

Unexpected ... by the expert; unfortunately, not all users have the same ...
intuition.

> The user should have done his section differently.

Of course he should - it wasn't really even a section.  However, one might
just conceive of the odd user who might just need chapter/section numbers
but NO titles - the extra space would then still be inserted (expected,
unwanted or otherwise).  A kinder sectioning macro would allow for such
eventualities, would it not?

Subject: [texhax] fitting a draw from into tex
Message-ID: <445044.93068.qm@web26110.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Dear Tex users,
   
  I want to fit a draw which I have done in words into tex. The problem is that the draw is 1/3 of the lenght of the word page and when I transfer into pdf and I include into tex using:
   
  \begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig1}
\caption{my graph}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
   
  I get  the title at the bottom of the page with a big space between the actual draw and the caption because the pdf file of the draw is a whole page. My question is:
   
  "Can you resize the page lenght of word of my draw so when I read into tex it does not take a whole page and title is just below the draw?" 
   
  I tried width and height  without sucess....
   
  Thanks a lot for your help,
   
  Bernard.

Ideally you should set up your printer to print a cropped pdf...

Use \centering in stead if the center environment to avoid 
attitional vertical space.

Use the crop tool in Acrobat or pdfcrop from CTAN 
<http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pdfcrop/>.
If you prefer a GUI try TpX <http://tpx.sourceforge.net/>.

Alternatively you can use the bb and clip options to 
\includegraphics.

Unfortunately, XML publishing through TeX is easier said than done.

Yes.

In short: thanks to XSLT and TeXML you can easily convert XML tags to
LaTeX commands and environments. You also need a [La]TeX style file which
defines formatting. This file has to be written by you.

A simple example can be found in the Consodoc package:

In a month, for one of the clients, we (bitplant.de) are going to deliver
a first TeXML-based publishing server for publishing technical
documentation, with support of Russian/Chinese/etc. Then I'm going to
summarize experience and submit a paper and a presentation for
XML Prague 2008 (xmlprague.cz). If you are interested, I can send an
alpha version of the paper (when ready) to you.

I use MikTeX and WinEdt (http://www.winedt.com).  The standard setup
allows one to double click on a word in the dvi file (in Yap - dvi
viewer) and move to the corresponding area in the (La)TeX file.  There
also is a facility to go in the reverse direction from the La(Tex)
file to the dvi file.  I would imagine that other editors have similar
functionality but I am not sure.

Best Regards

John

Consodoc looks very promising; are you in a position
to explain why it works only in a *X environment and
could not be made to work under Microsoft Windows ?

Actually, it should work under Windows. Consodoc and its components
(TeXML, SCons) are just Python scripts, the only complication is to find
out how to run this scripts under Windows. Should be easy if you are not
just a powerful user, but a programmer.

Subject: [texhax] pstricks problem
Message-ID: <94200F5F-B62A-4344-A711-89A653FC168E@tufts.edu>

I cannot understand the following problem, unless some style file has  
been corrupted.

Recently, to correct a problem caused by a typo in babel's latin.ldf  
file on TeXlive, I replaced that file with an updated one from CTAN  
(making no other changes).  Since then, whenever I tex a file whose  
package calls to pstricks are
************************************************************************ 
*********
\usepackage{pstricks, pst-plot,pst-math,pst-3dplot}
%\usepackage{pstcol, %%obsolete?
%\usepackage{pst-char, %%obsolete?
\usepackage{pst-node,pst-text}
\usepackage{pst-grad}
*******************************************************************
I get a string of error messages of the following sort:
*********************************************************************
! Package xkeyval Error: `linewidth=1pt' undefined in families  
`,pst-3d,pst-3dp
lot,pst-grad'.

See the xkeyval package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
  ...

l.142 ...line[linewidth=1pt, linestyle=dashed]{->}
                                                   (-0.5,0)(5,0)
************************************************************************ 
*
(various standard pstricks parameters get this treatment).
When I go into silent mode and simply ignore the warnings, the  
pictures come out fine.

Now, when I tex another file, whose calls to pstricks are just the  
first \usepackage above,
I get no error messages.

I am using TeXShop, with latex+ghostscript, using the latest  
distributions from TeXShop, which I believe are those on TeXLive.

Any ideas about what to do?

Unfortunately, XML publishing through TeX is easier said than done.
Especially, if you want complete automation.

Yes.

In short: thanks to XSLT and TeXML you can easily convert XML tags to
LaTeX commands and environments. You also need a [La]TeX style file which
defines formatting. This file has to be written by you.

A simple example can be found in the Consodoc package:

In a month, for one of the clients, we (bitplant.de) are going to deliver
a first TeXML-based publishing server for publishing technical
documentation, with support of Russian/Chinese/etc. Then I'm going to
summarize experience and submit a paper and a presentation for
XML Prague 2008 (xmlprague.cz). If you are interested, I can send an
alpha version of the paper (when ready) to you.

Is there a way to create a pdf (from latex) in which the fonts look
and print darker!? I have a font that is rather thin, and therefore
its look and feel is not as dark as I like it to be. I am hoping that
there is a way to darken the text without needing to play with the
printer settings. Thank you everyone.

If the font is not appropriate, why don't you use another one?

Hi everybody,

I wonder if it is possible grouping several references (for instance if I
want to refer to references 1, 2, 3 and 4 I would write [1-4]) by using the
\cite{} command in the "thebibliography" environment?
In case it is, can anybody explain to me how to do it?
Thanks

The following worked for me:

\usepackage[compress,square,comma,numbers]{natbib}
\usepackage{hypernat} %required if hyperref is used as well

\begin{document}

... \citep{abc95,abc96,abc98,def2000} ...

\bibliographystyle{unsrtnat} %to build the list of references in the order
                             %of citation
\bibliography{my_bibfile}

\end{document}

I hope you don't mind I'm passing this to the texhax list.

My only thought is that perhaps there was an error in the initial
LaTeX run.

The "natbib" package is a bit of an overkill if all you need is the above
(it aso allows different formatting of citations) and the "cite" packae is
probably all you need.

\usepackage{cite} will also do this.

Forgot to add:

If you use Mac OS X and DarwinPorts, then you can install Consodoc by
giving the command

sudo port install consodoc

But you might need to update the local database ("sudo port selfupdate" or
"sudo port sync").

How do I download the documentation for the crop package in MiKTeX? 

(I have downloaded the MiKTeX package in the past and I can see that the crop package resides in my computer. However, putting \usepackage{crop} in preamble and \crop before page one leads to no crop marks and no error message. The log file reads "Package: crop 2003/05/20 v1.9 crop marks (mf) ..... etc")

If the crop package is installed on your system you should be 
able to open the documentation by running

If you are using Windows you will find a dvi version of the manual  in

c:\miktex_2.7\doc\latex\crop\crop.dvi.  (Yow  may have to change the
initial directories in the path to reflect where miktex is installed
on your system)

Just like your post, eh? ;) Seriously, HTML mail on mailing lists is
probably the worst thing after spam and trolls, and it's actually bad
for you, not the list -- many people won't bother picking out the
message out of the useless HTML tags.  So disabling HTML mail in your
mailer, at least when posting to mailing list, will do you a great
deal of good.

All that said, there should not be many HTML posts on texhax (at least
I haven't come across too many).  If you do get one (and your mailer
cannot filter out HTML tags), you might try saving it to some file,
say, file.html (together with all the HTML tags), and then opening it
in a Web browser.  Hopefully, the browser will interpret the tags for
you and you will be able to copy-and-paste the TeX code from the post.
(At least this works for me with Firefox/Iceweasel.)

HTH,
Oleg

pdfeTeX 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4):

Please,

is there any way I can tell latex to include _all_ the graphics in a
particular directory ?  I do not wish to stipulate each file separately.

Lazy me.

Write a small script that generates the relevant LaTeX code in 
the scripting language of your terminal. Then \input that into 
your document.

Message-ID: <d3cf137e0801131913x59e8449cxad0a715e5bbbc4ee@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list

I have exactly one issue which is bothering me all the time in LaTeX:
Hyphenation.

I spent quite a while in searching for a handy solution to specify the
area where LaTeX shouldn't hyphenate words - with no luck. Microsoft
Office (yes I used the bad word) allows you to define an area where no
hyphenation is permitted. I wish I had something similar in LaTeX;
maybe an area in mm or in characters (meaning don't hyphenate when
only x characters are left before/after the hyphenation). I know about
"hyphenpenalty", "\begin{sloppypar}", "\sloppy, "\hbox{}",
"\hyphenation{}", "\mbox{}", etc., but those aren't real solutions and
certainly not very effective in a >100-page document...

Is there something I just missed in my research or is what I'm looking
for just not existent?

Any hint is much appreciated!

>From the babel manual:

hyphenrules
The environment hyphenrules can be used to select only the hyphenation
rules to be used. This can for instance be used to select
'nohyphenation', provided
that in language.dat the 'language' nohyphenation is defined by loading
serohyph.tex.

Also look up \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin.

Hmmm.  I hope you looked at:  

  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=hyphoff

Most of the methods discussed in the FAQ have paragraphs as their
minimum "areas", so depending on the extent of your regions, you
may be left with just one method: select language "nohyphenation".

I'm creating a CV from which I want to include my pubs list which I have a 
bib file for.  After bibtex-ing in a dummy file, I cut & paste the 
bibliography environment stuff over to my CV tex file.  However, the 
formatting is screwed up.  In particular, I dont' want the environment to 
print "references" (I want the CV tex file to handle the header/section 
titling).  What is the best solution for redefining thebilgiography 
environment to do what I want?

    meaning don't hyphenate when
    only x characters are left before/after the hyphenation

That sounds like \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin.  But LaTeX should 
already have them set to the conventionally correct values for English,
namely 2 and 3 (or whatever language, for that matter).

That's right. The thing is I use "babel" and if you use "babel"
\lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin are taking no effect.

conventionally correct values for English,
> namely 2 and 3


That's the reason why I would like to change that. I can't stand such short
hyphenation, I really wish LaTeX would provide an option for "Hyphenation
Zone" and "Limit consecutive hyphen"; would make things soo much easier...

Hi,

I was wondering about your experience with biblatex - would you think 
that it is ready for production use? Also, except its own (great) 
documentation, do you know of any tutorials about it? Google didn't show 
much, except a few brief mentions, which kind of suggests that it is not 
much used...

Thank a lot,

Since the original post asked about confining the non-hyphenation to only 
a portion of the file, I am surprised no one has mentioned the obvious 
solution, which appears below.  Note that the blank line that precedes the 
} is necessary since the hyphenpenalty has to be in effect when tex 
realizes that the paragraph is finished.  I suppose this could all be 
dressed into a latex environment, but I have not tried that.

Thank you for this, but that's not what I intended to ask for.

I just don't like when LaTeX hyphenates words after 2 characters or/and only
3 characters at the end. I would like to change this in a easy way and I
don't wanna do this for every mishyphened word as this is not efficient in a
big report. Further this should work for every language (well, for me only
english and german, but I'm sure other could use it too).

Actually it's not that much I'm looking for but so far, no solution worked
for me...(just deactivating hyphenation is not a solution to my problem)

Maybe this will come in LaTeX3? Just kidding...

That is not true.  What is true is that babel resets them every time
you change language, because they are specific to the language and the
hypenation patterns.  But babel provides hooks to override the configured
settings for each language:

\renewcommand\englishhyphenmins{{4}{5}}

I've got the working answer from Donald Arseneau:

As for the top posting: Sorry, I didn't realize that. I'm used to

Subject: [texhax] Page dimensions differ when LaTeX run on different host
Message-ID: <478E27E6.2090107@uit.co.uk>

I'm working on a book in LaTeX (thank goodness :-).
When I LaTeX the file here, the output is 470 pages long.
When someone at a different site does it, the output is 530 pages.

The 'layout' package shows the following dimensions (all in pt) differ:

				Mine	His
				----	---
	\oddsidemargin		-21	-11
	\textheight		538	462
	\topmargin		-39	-23
	\textwidth		402	352

The page dimensions are set with:

	\RequirePackage[papersize={177mm,232mm},twosideshift=0mm]{geometry}

How do you go about tracking down the cause of the differences?  The
only thing I can think of is to get a copy of all the .sty files used
(perhaps using the 'snapshot' package) and switching them in one by
one, but I dread the prospect.  Is there a better way?

   Thanks,
   Niall

I'm working on a book in LaTeX, which will I hope have future editions

Add a \listfiles at the top of the document and compare the log files.
And give geometry a verbose.

You don't say if you are generating pdf or dvi; are you sure the pages
have the same size? letter <-> a4?

the method i use when diagnosing problems is
to first get a copy of the two logs.  then:
 - make a list of the files input for run A,
   along with version number and date;
 - in the same list, add two more columns
   for the version numbers and dates shown
   in the log for run B.

if the sty files are well behaved, they will
have a \ProvidesPackage entry that reports
dates and version numbers in the log; if they
don't, write a polite note to the maintainer
asking that a \ProvidesPackage line be added
with the next update.

assume that the files *are* well behaved.

it's really easy to narrow down such a list
to only the files that are different.  then
a "diff" of the two versions should be adequate
to locate the actual differences.

of course, if someone has made "unauthorized"
local changes to any of the files, this "quick"
method won't work.  but i still prefer to use
the "diff" method of comparison (i actually
use emacs and a two-window compare) to making
substitutions one by one and running latex.

good luck.

not at all silly.  the snapshot package
provides the necessary version information
(but beware of files that don't include
\ProvidesPackage information -- those
really do need to be stored with the .tex
file(s) for the book).  you then have the
option of archiving multiple versions of
packages separately from the book (one
copy of each version) or bundling all the
files used for the book together.  if you
anticipate a platform change, bundling
is probably safer even though it requires
more storage space.

as a start try adding \listfiles before the \documentclass, then version 
numbers of all packages used will be written to the log file an to the 
console, then compare the two.

Message-ID: <a06240801c3b56e6a3627@[192.168.1.100]>

Dear TeX support,

I have been a TUG member for several years and have been happily 
using TeXShop version 1 (1.41) on my Macintosh Power Book G4 running 
Mac OS X 10.3.9.

I have now upgraded my computer to an iMac with Mac OS X 10.5.1 (Leopard).

I assume that I must/should update my version of LaTeX on this new 
computer.  I have the February 2007 CD/DVD's that were distributed by 
TUG last year, including TeX Collection, proTeXt,and  TeXLive 2007. 
Unfortunately, I am confused as to which, if any, of this software is 
compatible with Mac OS X 10.5.  Should I install TeXLive 2007, or do 
I need something else?  If the latter, how can I obtain it?

I have no local experts to consult, so I hope that you can advise me. 
Thank you very much.

I have *not* upgraded myself to Leopard, but MacTeX is the official  
TeXLive distribution for the Mac:

http://www.tug.org/mactex/

You can subscribe to the TeX on Mac OS X mailing list in

http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/

You'll find many people there that are already using Leopard.

I don't use Windows as my working platform (I use Mac OS), but I have  
Windows in a virtual machine, and my experience has been the same --- 
I installed MikTeX without any problem (first, MikTeX 2.5; yesterday,  
MikTeX 2.7), but I couldn't get a working installation of TeXLive.  
It's been quite easy on Linux and Mac, but not on Windows.

Now ---if you have succeeded installing MikTeX, why do you want to  
install TeXLive? For what I see, MikTeX is a very complete  
distribution, and, for example, TeXLive 2007 comes with XeTeX 0.996,  
whereas MikTeX 2.7 has already XeTeX 0.997 (the latest version from  
CVS).


Best,

Axel

Richard Koch has changed MacTeX to work with Leopard.[1] If bandwidth  
is not a big issue for the OP, I would suggest to download the latest  
version from

http://www.tug.org/mactex/

Best,

Axel

[1] From Richard's message to the TeX on Mac OS X mailing list (29/ 
VIII/07):

The packages contain a slightly modified simpdftex script, which will  
be necessary in Leopard when you typeset using TeX and Ghostscript mode.

 Hello,

I have LaTeX up and running and I've written basic code and can get a pdf output, etc. I get an error that the .dvi file is not creating. Is this important? I'm attaching some screenshots. On the second page of the screenshots are all of the files I *do* create for a project. I wonder if either of you have run into this before and could point me in the right direction.

I have proTeXt from http://www.latex-project.org, which consists of MiKTeX and TeXnikCenter. I also installed Ghostscript and GSView as recommended.

Thank you,

Don't worry. I see no errors, just different programs chattering about what they
did or didn't find. 

The last line is the clue

0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 badboxes

which basically means everything is OK

It doesn't make a .dvi file because it goes straight from LaTex to pdf.

In your preamble,

\raggedright
\parindent=1.5em % <- or whatever indent you want

Dear Mr Nguyen,

I'm forwarding this to TUG Support, as you replied only to me and I  
really can't help you, because, as I said, neither could I install  
TeXLive on Windows.

Message-ID: <5be0d07a0801190739m6f58beebw8ed49ef56c93d1a7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody.
Something strange is happening when including an image in my .tex file and
I'm going head over heels.
I run pdflatex on a file where there's only the image and it works. However,
when I copy the code for the image into my main file (in which there are
already some images) I get the message:

! Dimension too large

Does anybody know how can I overcome this problem?
Thanks in advance

The problem is solved!

I mixed erroneously the cropping (editing the dimensions) parameters of one
of the subimages that compose the xymatrix, and that one had not compatible
dimensions. That was the reason that made pdflatex give an error message.

Thank you anyway!

Is there a down and dirty way to typeset something like William Blake's
seven-foot lines in two columns ... no title page ... not much of
anything but the verse so that I can print to 8-1/2" x 11" paper, fold
it in half and carry it in my back pocket at work??

I know I'll have to use a god-awfully small font, but I've still got
good eye-sight and I have just got to have this ...

I've gotten so used to carrying a two-column text (a facsimile of the
Geneva Bible typeset in the sixteenth century) ... reading, and writing
notes on the backside has become a hugely productive endeavor---this
between cues on a live tv show.

Thank you for reading this.

this makes just 2 pages 4 columns each out of the www.gutenberg.org text
pblak10.zip (if that's what you mean -- unzip, remove the preamble, and
convert all '&' into '\&', then name it pblak10.tex):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[margin=0.3in,paperwidth=8.5in,paperheight=11in]{geometry}
\usepackage{multicol}
\begin{document}
\begin{multicols}{4}
\fontsize{5}{6}\selectfont
\input{pblak10}
\end{multicols}
\end{document}

(down and dirty indeed)

Dear Sarah,

You can give local files or folders their own URLs by prepending the  
"file://" scheme declaration.  So a URL for my documents folder would  
be "file:///Users/matthew/Documents/" (on Mac OS X).  I don't know  
what it would be on Windows.

Something like this *should* be possible.

\href{file:///Users/matthew/Documents/}{my documents}

after including the hyperref package.  I tried this, but it didn't  
work. :-( (The link is clickable but nothing seems to happen.

I also tried the url package in addition to hyperref, and this did work:

\url{file:///Users/matthew/Documents/}

But then the URL appears on the page, which may not be what you want.

I'm sure others on the list can help further.

Yours,
Matthew Leingang

This works for me with the 'hyperref' package:

\documentclass[11pt]{letter}
\usepackage[colorlinks=true]{hyperref}

\begin{document}

You can just check \href{http://www.hoo.hah}{here}

\end{document}

The OP specifically wanted to link to a local file/directory...Can  
you get hyperref to do that?

Thanks for smacking me upside the head :-}  I should pay closer  
attention...

Short answer: yes

Longer answer: yes and no

Start of the much longer answer:

I'm a bit perplexed by what I see, and I don't currently have a good  
"real" answer.  It works for me, as in

===================
\documentclass[11pt]{letter}
\usepackage[colorlinks=true]{hyperref}

\begin{document}

You can just check \href{http://localhost:8000}{here}.

Failing that, check \href{file:LRFG.pdf}{here}.

\end{document}
===================

as long as the generated pdf and the file in the 'file://' URL are in  
the same directory.  If they are not, it does not seem to work.  I  
tried many variants of the 'file://' URL, to no avail.  Only "file:// 
name" would work, where 'name' contains no "separators" ("/" on Unixy  
systems; "\" on those other systems).  In fact, I've checked 'name'  
in the form "foo.pdf", which worked, and "foo.txt", which did not[1].

One caveat: This works with Adobe Reader on a Mac.  If I use TeXShop,  
a Mac editor/viewer for TeX, this does not seem to work in any of the  
ways I have so far tried.  I have no idea what happens with other  
readers and OS's.

One more thing: at least with Reader on the Mac, when you click on  
the 'file://foo.pdf" link in the PDF, the linked PDF file opens in  
the same window.  You can get back to the original file with the  
"Previous View" button, or View->Previous View (not "Previous Page").

Sorry for the misleading first response and the somewhat involved  
follow-on.

Justin

[1] 'worked' -> Reader opened the linked file.  'did not' -> No  
response; the Mac app 'TextEdit' should have launched (if I  
understand how this is supposed to work).

Subject: [texhax] old script font
Message-ID: <4795445C.6060408@comcast.net>

I am afraid I was not able to come even close to an identification.

The first oddity about the font, even from the few characters visible on 
the page
(B, and F which confirms my impressions of the B) is that they are 
back-slanted.  This is not at all common with scripts, and I was not 
able to find anything in the general
class---leaving out the grosser forms of advertising scripts---that had 
this feature.

The left-hand loop is a a cousin to a swash, but it has nothing of the 
enthusiam of a swash.  So far as I can make out, the designer imagined 
the ductus as beginning at the top of the central stem, continuing down 
to the baseline and then around to the left and up again across the top 
of the stem, finishing with the two right loops, which end in a rise 
into the stem, so the the whole is completed with no loose ends and an 
almost dour flavor, quite unlike the flapping ends of swash strokes.  I 
couldn't find any display italic that worked so hard to hide the ends of 
the strokes.  It really is very distinctive.  I find it almost a bit 
gloomy. 

Rookledge has a font named Gando Ronde Script which includes an 
uppercase D that comes somewhat close to your B, but Gando Ronde looks 
happily frivolous in the rest of its characters; it is certainly not 
back-slanted, and the B and F are nothing like.

The back slant is the thing to look for first.  There are going to be so 
few of those.

The English text looks like vanilla Times, but from a rather careless 
foundry.  It is
a bit closer to Monotype than to ITC.

Sorry I couldn't do better.  What and where was the Press?

Message-ID: <47963EDB.9010100@lcturbonet.com>

I'm a new member of TUG (and new to the markup language of laTeX). 
Perhaps you would be kind enough to help a 'newbie' solve a problem that 
has arisen.

I'm trying to promote Calligraphic 'L' to/ mathop/ status for use in a 
new linguistic notation that I'm developing for a book in progress and 
have attempted to use /DeclareMathSymbol{\lsig}{mathop}{cmsy}{"4C} for 
the purpose.  My efforts have been in vain so far.  I suspect I'm not 
setting up the necessary font declarations but am not sure. Help would 
be appreciated.

Thanks,
  Eldon Lytle

PS: By the way, in an attempt to find font information, I've searched 
the TUG laTeX installation on my iMac for 'nfssfont.tex' without 
success. Is there an equivalent file by a different name that performs 
the same function? (TeXShop is the editor I'm using -- from the 
installation CD I recently purchased from TUG.)

If you have LaTeX installed, it should be there. 

  texmf*/tex/latex/base/nfssfont.tex

Is there a package "fonttable" available?  Or is fonttable.sty already
installed?  Don't know anything about fonttable but I found it when I
searched for "nfssfont.tex" in the TeX Live package database.

However, if you have LaTeX installed and nfssfont.tex is missing, then
most likely something is wrong with your installation.

  Reinhard

As Reinhard Kotucha said, it should be there. Mine (on Mac OS X) is in

/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/nfssfont.tex

Try, in Terminal.app,

kpsewhich nfssfont.tex

Also, MacTeX installer should have put a TeX directory inside / 
Library (the system wide /Library, not your $HOME ~/Library); open it  
and you'll find a symlink to Documentation; open that and, inside the  
symlink texmf-dist-doc, you'll see the documentation for fonts.

Take a look at

/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-doc/doc/english/mathmode/Mathmode.pdf,  
pp. 43-44 and 75-76, to define your operator without linking it to a  
specific font.

In your example the backslash in \mathop is missing. I would rather use

\newcommand{\lsig}{\mathop{\mathcal{L}}}

so you can use it with any font family.

There is a TeX on Mac OS X mailing list:

http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/

Axel

Dear All,

Apologies if anyone considers this OT.  It's at least obliquely
TeX-related.

For some while now, I've noticed that, if I try to scroll through a
(LaTeX-generated) file in xpdf while dvipdf is recreating the file,
xpdf exits - which closes not only the file being regenerated, but any
other files I have open in separate windows in the same copy of xpdf.

Today, I finally managed to capture the error message xpdf produces:

Error (49663): Illegal character '>'
Error (49633): Illegal character '>'
Error (49663): Illegal character '>'
Error (49633): Illegal character '>'

[1]    Segmentation fault            xpdf filename.pdf

Any ideas if there's anything I can do about this, please?

Subject: [texhax] lilypond/latex and vertical spacing
Message-ID: <20080124165330.GA4441@benburb.demon.co.uk>

Please,

I am trying to use lilypond-book (2.11.37) and latex (pdfeTeX
3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4)).

Essentially I am including a lot of 16 bar tunes into a collection,
intermixed with text.

Everything is working well and I am enjoying the processes involved.
Thank you all very much indeed.

But, I find that the vertical placement of the tunes is not
consistent.  Sometimes there are large gaps between tunes and
sometimes tunes do not start at the top of the page.  My code consists
of lots and lots of:

\begin{figure}
\lilypond-file{mylily.lf}
\end{figure}

I need to make sure that no tune involves a page break, that there is
consistent top margins and that the white space between tunes is
consistent.

The people over at lilypond-user at gnu.org admit this problem and
recommend I dump latex and do the whole job using lily :-(

Lily produces a _lot_ of eps files and I have tried lots and lots of:

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{lily-book-produced.eps}
\end{figure}

on these directly and skipping the lilypond-book stage.  The results
are no better.

Can I change my \includegraphics somehow ?  Should I try editing (the
eps boundary box's) ..... Any other suggestions ?

Thanks

This is ancient. Consider using TeXlive2007 instead.

Stop using figure.

Caveat: I know nothing about lilypond.

Tried that, but I do not get an integer number of tunes per page.
Having page turns in the middle of a tune is a real pain.

There is no way LaTeX will break a page in the middle of
\includegraphics{lily-book-produced.eps}
so you'll have to indicate what it is you have; please send
the latex input associated with one whole tune.

Guessing without information, I'll suggest replacing 
\begin{figure} with \noindent\begin{minipage}{\columnwidth}  
and \end{figure} with \end{minipage}\par.

Actually, lily seems to produce lots (and lots) of small eps files,
one for each line of the tune.  The importation of these can indeed
result in unfortunate page breaks.

Ah bullseye.  Thanks a lot.  That is a huge improvement.

It does leave me with lots of white space below some of the tunes and
I understand why this is happening.  Latex is including the mini pages
as it finds the \include statements.  My latex file is the end result
of a perl script, so I can change the sequence of the \includes, but
there is a fair bit of work in it: arranging the \include statements
to minimise the white space.

Is there any other approach ?  I am currently dealing with 179 tunes,
well, in chapters of say 50 or so !

Thanks again.

Dear colleagues,

Could you help me with these problems of citations and references, quite
typical in Economics?

I. Citation
1. How to make "author's (date)"?
That is, how to quote some work using the author's name with apostrophe,
using the \cite{...} of the bibtex?

2. How to make "author (date: ch. 2)"?
That is, how to cite a book, specifying the chapter, but not having the
author in parenthesis? The only way I know
"\cite[][ch. 2]{label}" places the authors in the parenthesis.

II. References
3 How to Capitalize proper names that belong to the article's title? The
bibtex place all words in lower case letters.

Best,

Carlos A. Cinquetti

Would you expect to be able to ride a lift up and down in a building while
somebody is replacing the cable? :)

Fair point.  But of course, I'd expect the response to pushing the
"call lift" button to be to make me wait until the cable replacement
was complete, not to open the door for me to step into the unsupported
cab.  The equivalence being that, as I understand it, it's never a
good idea for a program to segfault, no matter how crazily the user
behaves.

Hi, all,

The snippet below shows a problem I have with xymatrix: if I want to  
"bracket" a matrix as shown here, as I add more rows, the "box"  
around the diagram doubles in comparison to the size of the content.   
I did a quick check of the FAQ and the xy doc, but nothing leapt out  
as being directly relevant.

Is this expected behavior?  Explanations or fixes (so the diagram  
only takes up as much space as it would seem to need :-}) are  
appreciated; pointers to same would help as well.

Thanks for the help.

What I did for a songbook of mine was tell the eps-generating program to
produce pages of very small height. That led to eps files containing just
one or two lines of music. Then include them all via includegraphics.
That way TeX has more points where to place page breaks.

It's far from ideal, but as I am too lazy to learn how to write music
directly in TeX, that's the best I could find up to now.

Perhaps that helps,

If you're using the natbib package,

\citeauthor{...}'s \citeyearpar{...}

will do this.

I'd suggest, again with the natbib package

\citet[][: ch. 2]{label}

but I'm not absolutely sure where that will put the "ch. 2".

In the BibTeX database, enclose the letter you want to stay
capitalized in curly brackets, e.g.

title="Magneto-optical Sum Rules Close to the {M}ott Transition",

First, let me suggest that such questions are more appropriate for the 
xy-pic help group (xy-pic at tug.org) than texhax.  The answer to your 
specific question is to enclose the argument in a \vcenter:
\[\left.
\vcenter{\xymatrix{A\ar[r]&B\\C\ar[r]&D}}
\right\}
\]

This is also useful if you want to put an \eqno that is vertically 
centered, e.g.:
$$\left.
\vcenter{\xymatrix{A\ar[r]&B\\C\ar[r]&D}}
\right\}
\eqno(*)$$

Agreed; I didn't think to look for 'xy' mailing lists.  I'll check  
there for any such queries in the future.

Subject: [texhax] grouping attributes (text color)
Message-ID: <20080128200526.GD4202@run.duo>

In an itemized list I have some Verbatim text like so:

\item Some text.

\begin{Verbatim}[formatcom=\color{favorite}]
some technical details
\end{Verbatim}

\item More text.


Multi-color fancy headers/footers are also used in this (pdflatex)
doc. It seems that when the Verbatim text is near a page break, my
favorite color is applied outside Verbatim section or vice versa.

In other docs I use a floating table to wrap the Verbatim section
and I never saw this problem.

I presume the text color changes are not adequately "protected" or
reset across header/footer on page rendering. Is there a way to
fix this without using floating tables? I'd like the ability to
prevent a pagebreak within a Verbatim, but hopfully the fix will
allow the possibility of Verbatim crossing page boundaries.

Dear TeX users,

The usual assortment of news and information ...

Conferences:

- TUG 2008 (http://tug.org/tug2008) will return to Cork, Ireland, again
  hosted by Peter Flynn, July 21-24, 2008.  The deadline for submission
  of abstracts is April 30, 2008; more details at
  http://www.ucc.ie/en/tug2008/call.

- Other upcoming meetings include:
  BachoTeX 2008 in Bachotek, Poland:
    April 30-May 4, 2008: http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2008
    (web site and call for papers will be live soon).
  The second ConTeXt user meeting, in Bohinj, Slovenia,
    August 20-25, 2008: http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2008.

- Thanks to the generous sponsorship of the AMS, TUG had a very 
  successful exhibition booth at 2007 Joint Mathematics Meeting.  Thanks
  to those of you who stopped by!  One of the items we gave away at the
  JMM was a TeX calendar with images from the TeX Showcase
  (http://tug.org/texshowcase).  If you like, you can print the calendar
  for yourself; A4 and letter-size PDF's are at http://tug.org/calendar.

Software:

- On the software side, Christian Schenk has released MiKTeX 2.7
  (http://miktex.org); the main new feature is the inclusion of
  XeTeX.  Thomas Feuerstack has released the corresponding proTeXt
  (http://tug.org/protext), available from
  http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/windows/protext.

- The MacTeX distribution (http://tug.org/mactex) is still essentially
  that of TeX Live 2007, but the developers have released some updates
  so that it will work smoothly with Leopard.

- Work on TeX Live 2008 is progressing; the developers hope it will be
  released by this summer, in time for the TUG'08 conference.

Journals:

- The first issue of TUGboat for 2008 is the EuroBachoTeX 2007
  conference proceedings, a collaborative effort with DANTE, GUST, and
  other user groups.  It mailed a few days ago from Germany, to all 2007
  and 2008 members.
  
- We are collecting material for the second (regular) 2008 issue now,
  and welcome contributions of whatever sort (articles, notices,
  announcements, advertisements, ...); see http://tug.org/TUGboat.

- Issue 2007-4 of the PracTeX Journal has been published; it is
  available at http://tug.org/pracjourn.  The theme of this issue is
  Teaching LaTeX and TeX.

Interviews:
  
- The interview series continues, with Peter Gordon, Ross Moore, 
  and Susan DeMeritt & Cheryl Ponchin being the most recent
  interviewees: http://tug.org/interviews.
  
  We are considering publishing the interviews as an inexpensive (but
  nicely typeset) book, but before doing the work to produce it, we'd
  like to know if there is any interest.  If you might be interested in
  buying such a book, please drop a short note to interviews at tug.org,
  and thanks.
  

As always, we appreciate your support!

Happy TeXing,
Karl Berry (President) on behalf of the TUG Board

Possible solutions?
- Try with a different verbatim environment, e.g. listings.
- See if package pdfcolmk helps.
- If the problem is the same as the problem with color in 
footnotes or parallel texts maybe you can use pdfcol to solve it. 
See packages pdfcolfoot and pdfcolparallel for how it has been 
done in those cases.

Many LaTeX distros (as a matter of fact, *all* I know of) have old  
teTeX distributions. By far, the best TeX & friends distribution for  
Linux is TeXLive:

http://tug.org/texlive/

I think TeXLive 2008 is to be released soon, but I'm not sure.

I have successfully installed TeXLive 2007 under Ubuntu and Fedora.

Sadly true : this is true even for the Tug.Org copy, at

Many Linux distributions include TeX (and LaTeX) as a matter of course, so see 
if it isn't already present.  Ubuntu seems now to include a ?recent? TeXLive.

Subject: [texhax] Suppressing page numbers on float pages
Message-ID: <e507996c0801290716l72a60783yb74943aee6596121@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I hope this isn't a silly question, but I couldn't find an answer in
any of the usual sources, even though it must be quite common.

Is there a trick to suppressing the page number on a float page? I
can't make it work.

I have two large figures that LaTeX has put on a single page each,
consecutively -- call them pages 104 and 105. I need to get rid of the
page number on 104, because the figure's caption has nowhere else to
go but down there, but no matter where I put my \thispagestyle{empty},
it never affects either of the floats.

If I put it before, inside (!) or shortly after the definition of the
figure that's on 104, the page number on page 103 disappears instead,
and 104 stays. If I then gradually move it down the document, at a
certain point the gap 'jumps' and the number disappears from p. 106
instead. At no intermediate point does it affect 104 or 105. Is that
making sense?

I assume it's processing the thispagestyle before it moves the figures
around, and so generates new pages for them after that command has
taken effect in the wrong place. Any suggestions would be gratefully
received.

Cheers,

Andrew.

which document class?

the memoir class has buildin features for specifying the pagestyle on 
floatpages, but the standard classes does not.

Ah, no, it's just a report. I'll have a look at that, thanks.

If it turns out that turning it into a memoir would mess lots of other
things up, do you think there's a way to hack around it somehow? PhD
deadline in a month, don't want to lose all my formatting now or
something.

Hi,

I use abbrvnat as bibliofraphystyle, and don't use natlib.
\bibliographystyle{abbrvnat}
\bibliography{navicomm}
And I use JabRef version 2.3.1 to generate the .bib file.

When the number of authors is more than three, I wish the cite is shown as:
[Author1 et al.(2001)]
But the result I get is:
[Author1 et al.(2001)Author1, Author2 and Autho3,]

What can I do to get what I wished.
Thanks a lot.

And The version of my tex: "This is pdfeTeX, Version
3.141592-1.30.6-2.2 (MiKTeX 2.5) "

Using abbrnat without natbib is a strange choice that is likely to lead to
problems anyway.

Exactly, that's what natbib bibliographystyles give.  However, I don't
understand what you mean by "I wish the cite is shown as: [Author1 et
al.(2001)]" - you really want that to appear in print?

Anyway, try reading the natbib docs.

Hi!

My name is Lilian and I am using LATEX for the first time.

I have to write an article for "Lecture Notes in Computer Science" and  I
really cannot understand how to use the BibTex.

I have some questions:
1. I have the file llncsdoc.sty - how do I use it?
2. I am using the TeXnicCenter and I cannot find any BibTex icon. What
should I do?
3. Should I install BibTex first? I came to the CTAN website, but there  are
lots of files there and I don't know which one I should install...
4. I am using Windows, so which is the best way of typing my references?
5. I have a model provided by the LNCS where I find the following:

\section{BibTeX Entries}

The correct BibTeX entries for the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
volumes can be found at the following Website shortly after the
publication of the book:
\url{http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/journals/lncs.html}

Can it help me somehow?

I am sorry if my questions look a kind of stupid, but I am totally lost and
I do not have much time for doing it :P

Thanks for your help.

Yours,
Lilian.

Hello all,
I am co-writing a group paper where each member is responsible for a  
specific section. At the beginning of the paper, we have to list which  
pages each member wrote. I have labeled each section and can thus give  
the first page the member wrote using \pageref{secName}. I currently  
list the last page the member wrote by giving the first page of the  
next section: \pageref{nextSec}. If I change the order of the  
sections, however, I'll have to rewrite all these, which isn't very  
portable. Also, if the next section starts on a new page (like with  
\clearpage), the last page number will be incorrect.

I'd like to reference the last page of a section without referencing  
the next section, just like \lastpage, but with sections instead of  
the whole document. Does anyone know of a package like this?


Thanks for any response,

Hi,

I know of no such package, but I did think of a really nasty dirty trick
that might actually help you: put an empty element (such as an empty
equation) at the end of each paper, with a label in, like this:

     \label{author_lastpage}

or something similar, and then refer to \pageref{author_lastpage}.

I hope this (oe anything better someone else comes up with) helps!

Best wishes,
Yuri.

Subject: [texhax] Numbering within sections
Message-ID: <44ff02430801292225k608d0bbcxbbc5c03b42f0ea48@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
   I hate to abuse the mailing list twice in one day, but I have been
googling for hours. I need to number my citations within the section, just
like tables and figures. For the latter, I use
      \numberwithin{figure}{section}
in my preamble, but sadly there is no corresponding
      \numberwithin{citation}{section}.

After much reading about counters, I think it's because bibliographies use
labels (like the list environment) instead of a counter. I'm using the
natbib package, so I can get the citation to look correct in the text with
      \newcommand{\citenumfont}[1]{[\thesection-#1]}.

Unfortunately, this does not reset the counter at the end of the section,
and doesn't help with the References section at the end, either. I did a
search within natbib.sty for counters, finding NAT at ctr, but
      \numberwithin{NAT at ctr}{section}
did nothing.

I am really trying to make LaTeX easy for the other members of my group in
hopes of tearing them away from Microsoft Word, so any recommendations would
help me out tremendously.

Sincerely,
Bob

That's what I think.

I use the package floatpag, like this in the preamble:

\usepackage{floatpag}
\floatpagestyle{empty}

You can even change individual pages with \thisfloatpagestyle{...}.

floatpag.sty has a brief introduction to its usage.

decline in membership.  Why is this ?

Could it be that non-members find they don't really need it ?

I have joined only recently.

Just curious.

Congratulations! It may seem difficult at first (well ---it *is*

You have to tell us what distribution you're using (TeXLive? MikTeX?)  
to tell you where to put the file, but for the time being you can put  
it in the same folder/directory as your LaTeX document and, in your  
preamble (between \documentclass{...} and \begin{document} put  
\usepackage{llnsdoc}.

Whether you're using TeXLive or MikTeX, at the command prompt type

texdoc lshort

and hit <enter>. If you're using MikTeX, see also the MikTeX Manual.

Also, you can consult the BibTeX documentation with

texdoc btxdoc

You can find a wealth of information at

http://www.tug.org/interest.html

including references to BibTeX as well as Windows applications to  
manage your BibTeX databases.

See also the excellent TUG India tutorials:

Surely it doesn't have to be that dirty: just a simple
\label{author_lastpage} immediately at the end of the text is just fine.

No, it's not, which I think was fairly clear from my original mail. It
doesn't work on float pages, at least not as standard in a report. The
number gets removed from the page before or after the float.

Thankfully several people have made some suggestions which I'll try
out and report back to the list for posterity.

Hi everyone,

I'm wondering how I should define an FAQ environment. I'd like for it to
look something like the following:

Q: question 1 is?
A: answer 1.

Q: question 2 is?
A: answer 2.

I was thinking of using a list, but how do I control the spacing so that
there is a small space in between Q and the A below, but there is more space
in between A and the Q below it?

I know this is possible, but I don't know enough TeX to figure this out.

Thanks!

Zac

Here are my views on my five years of TUG membership.

** Background: 

I am a programmer with 20 years experience 
in the statistical programming language SAS.
Since 1989 I have attended SAS user group conferences.
I began publishing at these conferences in 1997.
My professional success is related to my attendance
and participation and networking at SAS User Group (SUG) conferences.

Five years ago, when I was beginning work on a book on my SAS niche
I had the choice of (La)TeX or Word.
I had a background in typesetting back in the 1960s: 
using IBM's Magnetic Tape Selectic Composer (MTSC) 
(also MTST==Typewriter) --
so I chose LaTeX.
Learning Curve happens!

YeahBut, unlike with MS products, once I learned it stayed learned.

Once TUG started the PracTeX conferences,
-- as opposed to the Developers conferences --
I thought that networking with dedicated users
would be A Good Thing for me as a novice user.

Yes, they are. I have attended PracTeX since the beginning
and each year have come away with more than one pearl
to take back and study.
For my work that is: FancyVrb and Beamer for presentations


** Is TeX Free Software!

I don't think so!
Anyone who has any sense of the value of their own time
knows that TeX's steep learning curve is not for the faint of heart
nor easily discouraged. In my own case I would not have persevered
without my BS/Computer Science and my 15 years SAS programming
experience.
Compared to my very limited experience with MS Word
getting LaTeX to print my programs is easy!


** My TUG Membership

I am both a dues-paying member and a regular financial contributor.
For me, I pay for good advice. 
Compared to what I pay for my participation in SAS User Group
conference,
my TUG membership and contribution are juice that is worth the squeeze.


** How Often is Ofter-Enough?

SAS Institute supports an annual international conference in the spring.
There are half a dozen independent annual regional conferences in the
U.S. during the fall
In addition there are state and city user groups.
Regular meeting schedule is quarterly.


** What is missing?

Local or regional meetings or conferences.
I think we need to raise the bar for long-time TeX users.
It is time to expect Old-Timer to pass on their knowledge.

See Steven Covey's book: 
The Eighth Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness

http://www.stephencovey.com/8thHabit/8thhabit.php


** What is 'Better' for TeX?

* improvement in TeX strength?

* making TeX strength 'easier' for new users


** Modest Proposal

I am aware of Scientific Word and PC-TeX but have not used either one.
Due to work pressure I am a Windows user.
I use UltraEdit as my text editor, which I purchased before I began to
work w/LaTeX.
XeMacs is on my to-do list and maybe once I start aspiring to be a Unix
geek
I may get there.

Q: Should the TeX community, or TUG,
engulf and devour a Really Good TeX(t) Editor
in order to make TeX strength 'easier' for new users?

Hi Andrew,

Using \thispagestyle{empty} should remove headers and footers (not only
page numbering). Instead, try constraining the height of each figure
with the following call:
\includegraphics[height=\textheight]{filename}

You can also use the pdfpages package to control the scaling. I've had
success with these solutions in a book .cls document.

I haven't researched this, but there might be a package which allows you
to apply different page sizes (e.g. A4) to specific pages.

Hope this helps,
Richard

Hello all,
"A \ar {->}[r]&B"  gives an arrow that begins at A and ends at B.
How to make that arrow starts exactly from A (touches A), i.e., no space
between A and the arrow?

Hi folks,

I hope this isn't a silly question, but I couldn't find an answer in
any of the usual sources, even though it must be quite common.

Is there a trick to suppressing the page number on a float page? I
can't make it work.

I have two large figures that LaTeX has put on a single page each,
consecutively -- call them pages 104 and 105. I need to get rid of the
page number on 104, because the figure's caption has nowhere else to
go but down there, but no matter where I put my \thispagestyle{empty},
it never affects either of the floats.

If I put it before, inside (!) or shortly after the definition of the
figure that's on 104, the page number on page 103 disappears instead,
and 104 stays. If I then gradually move it down the document, at a
certain point the gap 'jumps' and the number disappears from p. 106
instead. At no intermediate point does it affect 104 or 105. Is that
making sense?

I assume it's processing the thispagestyle before it moves the figures
around, and so generates new pages for them after that command has
taken effect in the wrong place. Any suggestions would be gratefully
received.

Cheers,

Andrew.

which document class?

the memoir class has buildin features for specifying the pagestyle on 
floatpages, but the standard classes does not.

Ah, no, it's just a report. I'll have a look at that, thanks.

If it turns out that turning it into a memoir would mess lots of other
things up, do you think there's a way to hack around it somehow? PhD
deadline in a month, don't want to lose all my formatting now or
something.

Hi,

I use abbrvnat as bibliofraphystyle, and don't use natlib.
\bibliographystyle{abbrvnat}
\bibliography{navicomm}
And I use JabRef version 2.3.1 to generate the .bib file.

When the number of authors is more than three, I wish the cite is shown
as:
[Author1 et al.(2001)]
But the result I get is:
[Author1 et al.(2001)Author1, Author2 and Autho3,]

What can I do to get what I wished.
Thanks a lot.

And The version of my tex: "This is pdfeTeX, Version

Using abbrnat without natbib is a strange choice that is likely to lead
to
problems anyway.

Exactly, that's what natbib bibliographystyles give.  However, I don't
understand what you mean by "I wish the cite is shown as: [Author1 et
al.(2001)]" - you really want that to appear in print?

Anyway, try reading the natbib docs.

Hi!

My name is Lilian and I am using LATEX for the first time.

I have to write an article for "Lecture Notes in Computer Science" and
I
really cannot understand how to use the BibTex.

I have some questions:
1. I have the file llncsdoc.sty - how do I use it?
2. I am using the TeXnicCenter and I cannot find any BibTex icon. What
should I do?
3. Should I install BibTex first? I came to the CTAN website, but there
are
lots of files there and I don't know which one I should install...
4. I am using Windows, so which is the best way of typing my references?
5. I have a model provided by the LNCS where I find the following:

\section{BibTeX Entries}

The correct BibTeX entries for the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
volumes can be found at the following Website shortly after the
publication of the book:
\url{http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/journals/lncs.html}

Can it help me somehow?

I am sorry if my questions look a kind of stupid, but I am totally lost
and
I do not have much time for doing it :P

Thanks for your help.

Yours,
Lilian.

Hello all,
I am co-writing a group paper where each member is responsible for a  
specific section. At the beginning of the paper, we have to list which  
pages each member wrote. I have labeled each section and can thus give  
the first page the member wrote using \pageref{secName}. I currently  
list the last page the member wrote by giving the first page of the  
next section: \pageref{nextSec}. If I change the order of the  
sections, however, I'll have to rewrite all these, which isn't very  
portable. Also, if the next section starts on a new page (like with  
\clearpage), the last page number will be incorrect.

I'd like to reference the last page of a section without referencing  
the next section, just like \lastpage, but with sections instead of  
the whole document. Does anyone know of a package like this?


Thanks for any response,

Hi,

I know of no such package, but I did think of a really nasty dirty trick
that might actually help you: put an empty element (such as an empty
equation) at the end of each paper, with a label in, like this:

     \label{author_lastpage}

or something similar, and then refer to \pageref{author_lastpage}.

I hope this (oe anything better someone else comes up with) helps!

Best wishes,
Yuri.

Hello all,
   I hate to abuse the mailing list twice in one day, but I have been
googling for hours. I need to number my citations within the section,
just
like tables and figures. For the latter, I use
      \numberwithin{figure}{section}
in my preamble, but sadly there is no corresponding
      \numberwithin{citation}{section}.

After much reading about counters, I think it's because bibliographies
use
labels (like the list environment) instead of a counter. I'm using the
natbib package, so I can get the citation to look correct in the text
with
      \newcommand{\citenumfont}[1]{[\thesection-#1]}.

Unfortunately, this does not reset the counter at the end of the
section,
and doesn't help with the References section at the end, either. I did a
search within natbib.sty for counters, finding NAT at ctr, but
      \numberwithin{NAT at ctr}{section}
did nothing.

I am really trying to make LaTeX easy for the other members of my group
in
hopes of tearing them away from Microsoft Word, so any recommendations
would
help me out tremendously.

Sincerely,
Bob

1.  At the end of each section, write the number of the last page to an 
external file
(This is using plain TeX, I don't know how it would look in LaTeX)

\outer\def\bye{%
  % front matter has negative values in \count0, otherwise \count0 is 
set up for next 
  % page.  \endpage was set by reading endpage.tex at start of this 
run.  See below
  \ifnum\count0 > 0 % Don't bother with front matter
    \endcount=\count0\ifskipblank\global\advance\endcount by -1
    \message{doing blank page}\fi % blank verso page if needed
    \openout\endwrite=endpage
    \ifnum\endcount=\endpage \advance\notecount by -1 % was set up for 
next note
    \message{====lastpage=\the\endcount    ====lastnote=\the\notecount}%
    \else\message{END PAGE NOT CORRECT--RUN AGAIN}\fi
    \write\endwrite{\noexpand\endpage=\the\endcount}%
  \fi
  \supereject\end}

2.  Rerun if necessary.

3. Read the external file at the start of each run, and set the value of 
\the\endpage where you need it.  Notice that even if endpage.tex doesn't 
exist, TeX won't choke.


\openin\endread=endpage
\ifeof\endread
\closein\endread
\else
\closein\endread % reset input pointer to start of file.
\input endpage
\fi
 
The file endpage.tex reads simply: 
\endpage =70

There is a registration discount for WinEdt through TUG:

http://www.tug.org/winedt/

and there are a number of opensource TeX front-end available from  
CTAN, and of course, for the emacs-users there's AUCTeX:

    Once TUG started the PracTeX conferences,
    -- as opposed to the Developers conferences --

We try to make all the conferences have material useful for both users
and developers.  There aren't enough people going to conferences to make
it feasible to split them.

    Local or regional meetings or conferences.

Well, Lance Carnes (who also originated the practex series) just had a
one-day meeting of classes in Berkeley.  For anyone who wants to
organize one, we can put notices on tug.org, etc.

    It is time to expect Old-Timer to pass on their knowledge.

The amount of documentation, books, code, etc., is pretty vast.

    * making TeX strength 'easier' for new users

Personally I think XeTeX is a remarkable development in this area,
making it possible to use native fonts and Unicode with essentially no
extra effort.

Best,
karl

    I read somewhere on the tug website that there has been a steady
    decline in membership.  Why is this ?

I don't know where you read it (if you can find it again, let me know),
but it is not true any more.  TUG gained about 75 members in 2007 over
2006, and 2006 and 2005 were essentially steady (difference of 10
members out of ~1500).

TUG did lose members each year between 2001-2005, which I attribute to a
combination of many people getting on the Internet (hence no need to get
the CD's) and TUGboat falling (way) behind schedule.

    Could it be that non-members find they don't really need it ?

It is undoubtedly true that the vast majority of TeX users have no need
to join TUG.  It's not like you have to join TUG to get the software :).

Many people join TUG because they care about TeX and friends and want to
support it, not because they have a desperate need for TUGboat or the
other benefits.

    I have joined only recently.

Thanks for your support :).

Karl

Hi Karl,

I am a new subscriber as of about three months ago and also new to TeX. I
was overwhelmed with just the basics and so I decided to join with the
idea that it might make things easier. So, from my most immediate point of
view, I wasn't interested in the finer aspects of the system, I just
wanted to master the basics so that I could get this first document done.
I posted two questions to the group and the first response was ..."OMG,
does he know what he is doing?' (of course the answer is no! I thought
that would have been obvious). The second question got no responses at
all. So in fact the value of membership to the group has been zero so far.

I think that there might be quite a few people like me out there and so
perhaps it would be good if many of the senior/advanced members were to
bear this im mind and make the effort to help basic users (telling someone
to refer to a manual is not really providing any help and such a response
is not worth posting - is it??!!!). I am sure that some long-term members
altready help as much as they can, but I thought it may be worth just
mentioning this.

cheers, Bruce

Hi

I'm also a new TeX(live) user. After some back and forth I got my question
answered, but I really don't like the mailinglist-system. While this is may
good for occasional and though questions from advanced users, it's totally
the wrong way to go for newbies. What I really miss is a central forum and a
central wiki.

I really don't care about regional meetings and stuff, but I would, as soon
as my skills are better, share my knowledge in a forum and/or wiki. Somehow
this whole TeX-community is like an exclusive/closed scientific-nerd club
(don't take it too hard guys)  ;)

Just my 2 cent.

Use one of the packages mentioned, or a document class (like memoir)
that supports it.  This used to be quite frequently asked, so searching
"google groups" will give answers too.

> \usepackage{floatpag}

Good way.


There was some confusion about how to use \thispagestyle for
this purpose.  Here's how; it is ad-hoc and meant for final 
fix-ups before you submit.  Don't worry about the appearance
while you are writing.

Where you declare the float (or in the text just before where the 
float eventually gets placed) declare

\pagestyle{empty}
\thispagestyle{plain}%  or "headings"... your regular page style

Then in the text on the page after the float placement, declare

\pagestyle{plain}

Dear Zac,

That's not too hard if you use some skip commands.  Is this what  
you're looking for?
--
\documentclass{article}
\title{FAQ}

\newenvironment{question}{%
   \bigskip\noindent\textbf{Q:}\ }
   {}

\newenvironment{answer}{%
    \medskip\noindent\textbf{A:}\ }
    {}

\begin{document}

\begin{question}
	question 1 is?
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
	answer 1.
\end{answer}

\begin{question}
	question 2 is?
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
	answer 2.
\end{answer}

\end{document}
--

The way things are defined you could either have your questions and  
answers come one after the other like they are now, or you could nest  
your answers inside the questions with the same results (but that TeX  
file might be more easily parsed by other programs). You could also  
rewrite things so that answer is only valid inside question.

Eventually you might get annoyed with the pagebreaking and try to  
coax TeX to break before a question rather than between a question  
and its answer.  That's doable by looking at the \pagebreak commands  
(although I don't know enough to test it right now).

Hope that helps!

You can post and read messages using your favorite news client 
through gmane.org. <http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.tex.texhax>. 
Also the usenet group comp.text.tex is quite friendly to new users.

I guess we define user friendly resp. usability differently...
A forum and a wiki is something total different from that.

Thanks for the reply Matt! =)

Yup, that's exactly the part I'm concerned about. Is there a way to
discourage LaTeX from breaking inside a question? \nopagebreak looks
nice, but I'm wondering whether there is a more "advanced" and
"professional" treatment. I was hoping I could learn some new command
or new way of coding. If not it'll have to do for now.

Well, [no name provided] this is a forum that you are posting to. It  
just so happens that it uses an email client to display postings  
rather than a web browser. It is run by volunteers and is the product  
of an initiative that no doubt was started by one person's idea. In  
fact most activities in the TeX community are voluntary and no one is  
required to respond to any posting or question and indeed the  
community is run at cost to the individuals concerned so that you have  
some thing to complain about.

In the adult community, when one observes that there is a useful  
feature that may make life easier and if one has the time and  
facilities to action it, then a person may provide such services and  
perhaps make them available to the wider community. However most  
people who answer questions on this forum (and for that there are  
large numbers who are grateful) are also living a life and working to  
support that life. It may be that the idea has been considered but  
that the person/people had not the time or facilities to see it into  
fruition. Clearly you believe there is a need for this kind of  
interface so why don't you start the wiki or the forum and join in the  
spirit you say you crave to be part of? In other words, what are you  
offering in return for your demands?

                 The XVIth Polish TeX Users Conference
                          BachoTeX 2008
                        "TeX contra TeX"

                       Call for Papers
                             and
                       Call for TeX Pearls

                 http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2008
---------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Call for Papers

     This is the call for papers for BachoTeX 2008, the XVI Polish
TeX Users Group Conference April 30--May 4, 2008, Bachotek (Brodnica
Lake District), Poland.


     The conference title is

                 "TeX contra TeX"

     We now have several TeX engines, from frozen and even obsolete
through those being in use and actively maintained up to ones to be
yet released.  To mention some: Aleph, e-TeX, ExTeX, LuaTeX, Omega,
pdfTeX, XeTeX and -- of course -- TeX itself.  Add to this a number
of macro packages, again actively developed or frozen and
unmaintained: AMS-TeX, ConTeXt, LAMS-TeX, Lambda, LaTeX and of
course plain TeX, either or not suitable to be used with those
engines.  All were developed with different aims and under
different conditions and therefore have various strengths and
weaknesses.  Some are still being developed.

The knowledge about these developments is not widespread.  We want
to compare and contrast them for the benefit of all, thus the word
"contra" in the title should not be taken literally -- it is not
to be a fight but a confrontation with differences, merits and
faults carefully scrutinized.  The central day of the conference
will be devoted to this theme.  We especially invite authors,
developers and experts of these engines.  And what about companion
programs like METAFONT and METAPOST?  Is METAFONT still used?  What
is happening with METAPOST?  Come and let us know!

     There will be also two other key themes:

                 "What is TeX for me?"
and
                 "Aesthetic aspects of typesetting"

The former is intended to become a session or perhaps a
sub-conference dedicated to the youngest generation of TeXies.  It
was inspired by Sam Guravage, the youngest ever presenter at a
EuroTeX conference, who at EuroTeX 2007 gave the talk "Confessions
of a teenage TeX user" for which he was awarded a diploma.  Out
there are surely very young people who use TeX -- we would like to
hear from them!  We are also sure that they would like to talk to
each other about their experiences.

The second theme aims not only at TeXies but also those who use other,
broadly typesetting related software like Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator,
InDesign or Scribus, to name but some.

We encourage papers on:
- the borders of editing and typesetting,
- design of typographical layouts,
- aesthetic typesetting rules,
- microtypography,
- embedding graphics in the design,
- and, of course the aesthetic of using fonts.


     As always, there is space for other topics:

- enhancing graphics engines,
- new or improved macro packages,
- user interfaces,
- new font technologies.

Effectively, one can come and talk about everything, but it would be
nice if there is some focus on the mentioned aspects.

     Proposals for TeX and typography related tutorials or
introductions are especially welcome.  If you have suggestions for
tutorials or workshops by others than yourself or about specific
topics, please let us know.

     Proposals (abstracts) should be e-mailed to attention of the
Program Committee which listens at the address of  papers-2008 at
gust dot org dot pl. Boguslaw Jackowski is the
appointed chairman.

     The deadline for abstracts is 9th of March 2008.  The deadline
for the final papers will soon be published at the conference web
site: http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2008.



                            Call for TeX Pearls

We are continuing the tradition of "The Pearls of TeX Programming".
Here is briefly what is wanted:

    * short TeX, MF or MP macro/macros
    * results should be virtually useful yet not obvious
    * easy to explain: 10 minutes at most

If you yourself have something that fits the bill, please consider
sending it in.  If you know somebody's work that does the same, please
let us know, we will contact the person.  Other details and previously
collected pearls can be found at
http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls/.
The email address is: pearls at gust dot org dot pl.

Subject: [texhax] bug report documentation: Fonts for LATEX on OS X
	(2nd	version)
In-Reply-To: <6B13993A-DDA3-4689-A89E-BBCE85C7308B@dandy.net>

Message-ID: <88C23D81-ED2E-4B20-8F10-5E4B148233C8@mac.com>

The original author was me, and yes I could correct the two misprints,  
but that wouldn't make much sense: the tutorial was written in  
end-2003 and has not been updated much since; accordingly, most of it  
has either become obsolete or requires significant adaptation.  
Updating some parts and not others would be a bit pointless.

The tutorial was originally just a post to the OS X TeX list. Bob  
Kerstetter decided to transform it into a document, first in LaTeX  
then converted to HTML format. I hand-edited the HTML output and Bob  
together with Wendy McKay put it online.

I had said from the beginning that I wouldn't be able to keep the  
tutorial current (owing to lack of time), that I expected it would  
become a community effort. Bob Kerstetter volunteered to maintain it.

In my view the document is provided as is, with the understanding that  
it's not current and some adaptation by the reader is required. If  
that's indeed a problem, then I would recommend to just put the  
tutorial offline.

Personally I'm not much in this font stuff anymore. When serious font  
issues are involved I'm using XeTeX, and most of the time I'm  
perfectly happy using Textures which allows me to concentrate on  
content and forget about this high-profile but so time-consuming TeX  
hacking.

Below is a post I made to the OS X TeX list yesterday, followed by the  
two requests from Steve and Karl.

I will also add notes and correct the misprints. This will be over  
the weekend or early next week. My work schedule is pretty much  
impossible right now. At this time, I intend to keep the current  
document online on my personal web site for its reference value, but  
will add in the next few days a disclaimer about its it being  
outdated, its value as starting point and its need for adaption.

I have thought about reworking the document, but as Bruno points out,  
font conversion is very time consuming and the goal of having font  
flexibility can be much more easily accomplished with XeTeX.

I am not against a complete update, but because of job pressures  
would not be able to consider getting started until sometime in late- 
March, about two months from now.

Hi

I don't know why you are that pissed and assume that I'm a kid?! I'm well
aware about the volunteer fact and I did not deny or attack that at all! I
even did not demand anything. I just wrote my thoughts, that's all.

Because I don't own the domain/server I can't publish a forum or a wiki. To
setup a forum and a wiki is ridiculous easy and yes, I could do that.

I know that speech, 10 years ago the Linux folks sounded pretty much like
you. I'm very thankful that those guys have nothing to say anymore...

However, I just spend some time to express an outsider-view. If you don't
like it fine. I can live with that  ;)

In either case, no. Not annoyed at all, just pointing out what it  
means to be courteous in a public forum and being adult is a state of  
mind not necessarily age.

Really there is no point in being offensive if you want people to  
assist you. Oh never mind....

Well, you started to be offensive, not me. I just provided a short-cut
feedback (you are not supposed to response to a feedback anyway, but that's
on another page). I didn't ask for your response nor for help, but I guess
you didn't get that. Oh never mind...  ;)

PS: Your "[no name provided]" is really childish.

Hi Bruce, this is indeed very unpolite and inappropriate.  Things like
this shouldn't happen.  On the other hand, this is quite untypical for
this list.  There are many people who invest an enormous amount of
their spare time in order to help others.

 > So in fact the value of membership to the group has been zero so far.

The membership fee is not spent for answering your questions.  Nobody
who helps other users gets money from TUG.

They actually do.

 > (telling someone to refer to a manual is not really providing any
 > help and such a response is not worth posting - is it??!!!).

In most cases people are not aware that there is documentation at all
or don't know where to search for it.  In many cases it is sufficient
to point people to the documentation.

What you can't expect is that someone reads documentation for you and
explains things which are explained already.  If something is unclear,
you are welcome to ask here, but you have to explain in detail what
exactly in the documentation is unclear.

Please don't forget that people on this mailing list already spend a
lot of time answering other people's questions.  They do not only
answer, they try to reproduce problems on their machines, they develop
code if necessary, they read documentation, they read documentation,
they read documentation, they read documentation...

Bruce, what do you expect?  Pointing people to the documentation had
always been a good idea and most people had been happy because TeX
related documentation is quite good.  They simply didn't know
what/where to search for.  Don't expect that someone does something
for you what you can do yourself.

Never forget that nobody is paid for providing help.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Well, more to the point, we could all have lived perfectly happily without
your "expressions" ;-).  Then again, we nerds don't get so uptight about
anything much, I suppose.  However, we do prefer to use real signatures
rather than hide behind the easy anonymity of the web.

Cheers,  Phil  (but you can just call me "nerd", I can live with that ;^).

Well, I apologize if I really hurt someones feelings. It was not intended
that way...it's a sarcastic joke to make my point clear.
However, I decide whether or not I give out my real name and this decision
has to be respected.

As this discussion leads to nowhere, I'm stopping to upset you guys any
further and keep myself out of trouble...  ;)

The membership renewal form is a little confusing.

I'm about to update my G4 running OS X 10.9 to a MacMini running 
Leopard. I wan't to upgrade from TEX Shop to the latest version. Along 
with my dues should I purchase TEX Live 2008, or do I need MacTEX? 
(Ordering MacTEX is not a selectable option on the form.)
