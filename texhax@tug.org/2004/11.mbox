Many thanks to all the people from this mailing list
who provided help to this matter:
Edward G.J. Lee, Wouter, Karl Berry, Haruhiko Okumura, Reinhard Kotucha,
and especially Tang, with whom the discussion continued privately.
I'm giving a complete step by step report
(in case it could turn to be useful to somebody else)
of the whole procedure I had to follow
to install ChiTeX first, and then to configure Emacs
to correctly display and input chinese characters.
(I tried to write it carefully,
 but there might be errors and imprecisions.)
Maybe someone will improve and correct this report,
and add some steps or suggest some different ones.
I hope that similar reports about other 'exotic' languages
and writing systems will be written, if they haven't been yet,
and that they are or will be easily found by the users.

The procedure I'm giving does not allow to input
Simplified and Traditional Chinese within the same file.
This is possible using other packages and input methods
like scim and mule-gbk,
but when I installed and tried to use them
other problems and 'side effects' arose,
so I'm not reporting about them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
My operating system: Linux Mandrake 9.1.

1) From http://cxterm.sourceforge.net I downloaded the 5.2.3 version
   of cxterm and installed it with:

   	$ tar xvfz cxterm-5.2.3.tgz
   	$ cd cxterm-5.2.3
   	$ ./configure
   	$ make
   	# make install

   . During the installation, I got the error message

	/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lncurses

   , so I had to install the package 'libncurses-devel' with the command

	# urpmi libncurses-devel


2) ChiTeX: I went to ftp://ftp.math.ncu.edu.tw/chitex/unix/6.1.2p12lc/
   and downloaded all the files that were there: it's 190 megabyte.
   I created a directory '~/6.1.2p12lc' and put all these files into it.
   In the terminal, in the home directory I gave the command

	$ cxterm

   and a new terminal screen appeared. From this terminal,
   I went into the '~/6.1.2p12lc' directory and gave the command

	# ./setup

   (if necessary, make 'setup' excutable with: '$ chmod +x setup').
   During the installation I was prompted by various messages
   in chinese characters.
   Here's the translation of the most important ones.

3) Now the problem of typing chinese characters in the input file.
   I checked if Emacs could show chinese characters:
   within Emacs, I typed:

	M-x view-hello-file

   and on the line which begins with 'Chinese' I could read
   the chinese characters. Then I typed

	C-u M-x toggle-input-method RET TAB

   and checked that the 'chinese-py' input method was there.
   (If not, installing the 'leim' package may be needed.)


4) Now the problem of *reading* chinese characters in Emacs.
   First I checked the presence of the font name 'fangsong ti'
   in my system with the command

        $ xfontsel

   . I found that font. Then I added to my .emacs the following lines:

	  (create-fontset-from-fontset-spec "-isas-fangsong
         ti-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-c-160-gb2312.1980-0" t)

        (set-language-environment "Chinese-GB")
        (set-selection-coding-system 'cn-gb-2312)
        (set-clipboard-coding-system 'cn-gb-2312)
        ;(set-keyboard-coding-system 'cn-gb-2312)
        (setq locale-coding-system 'cn-gb-2312)
        (set-terminal-coding-system  'chinese-iso-8bit)
        (setq default-input-method 'chinese-py-punct)

   (I cancelled the line about the keyboard coding system
    oherwise I could not input some latin characters
    such as ?, ?, ?, etc.)

   Then I closed Emacs and reopened it with the example file
   'math1gb.tex' which is featured in the ChiTeX release and... voil?!
   The chinese characters appeared. Now I could both read chinese
   characters, and type them via 'chinese-py' input method.
   This is used to write 'simplified Chinese', widely used in China
   mainland, whereas 'chinese-py-b5' is used to input
   Traditional Chinese, used only in China's Hong Kong and Taiwan district.
   To type 'Hallo', I just did:
	n i 1 h a o 1
   . Besides, I could easily switch from chinese to english input method
   and vice versa just tiping 'C-\'.


5) Now the problem of inputting Traditional Chinese. I opened a new file
   'myfile' with

	$ emacs myfile

   , then did 'C-u C-\ TAB' and select the chinese-py-b5 input method.
   By typing: 'z h o n g TAB 1 1 g u o TAB 2' I got the expression `China'.
   I still could switch to english input method tiping 'C-\'.
   When I saved 'myfile', Emacs asked me to select
   an appropriate coding system. I just selected 'big5'.
   (Anyway, you can select the 'big5' coding system with 'C-x RET f'
    before saving the file.) When I opened 'myfile' I got chaos code,
   because my default coding system was gb2312, so Emacs decoded the file
   with gb2312. Then I closed the 'myfile' buffer,
   did 'C-x RET c TAB' and selected the big5 coding system,
   and then reopened 'myfile' with C-x C-f.
   To avoid getting chaos code, you can also put this line
   as first line of your big5 based file:

            %;; -*-coding: chinese-big5;-*-

   , then Emacs will understand it's a big5 based file,
   and open directly the file with '$ emacs myfile';
   otherwise, open emacs with '$ emacs', do 'C-x RET c', then TAB
   and select the big5 coding system,
   and then open the file with C-x C-f.


6) Configuration of Gnus: I added to ~/.gnus.el the following lines:

        (setq gnus-default-charset 'cn-gb-2312
          gnus-newsgroup-ignored-charsets '(unknown-8bit x-unknown
          iso-8859-1))

   in order to handle chinese characters.
   With Gnus I could post and receive email containig cinese characters.


7) Running ChiTeX: if your file, say it 'myfile.tex',
   contains Simplified Chinese, add at the beginning of it
   the first lines of the file 'math1gb.tex' featured in ChiTeX release
   (and at the end of it add the TeX command '\end', of course);
   if your file contains Traditional Chinese
   add at the beginning of it the first lines of the file 'math1.tex'
   also featured in ChiTeX release. Then run ChiTeX with:

	$ chitex myfile

Message-ID: <20041101202026.97573.qmail@web60408.mail.yahoo.com>

I want to write a price_labels.tex in TeX for printing
price labels in 3*10 stick peel off sheets.
price_labels.tex was called by perl CGI. Data will be
produced by Perl. Start position for labels should be
passed to price_labels.tex because labels could be
started at 2 column and 3 rows. Every labels printed
has company image. The long text should be wrapped.

I am new to Tex(Latex). Does any body have experience
with this?

Any suggestion will be appeciated.

Thanks

Hello, I am trying to set the command characters for Verbatim
environment in fancyverb.sty as;

  \DefineVerbatimEnvironment{MySplus}{Verbatim}{commandchars=@``}

so I can change the style of S-Plus code partially like;

  \begin{MySplus}
     @textsl` sl style splus code here ` 
     tt style splus code here
  \end{MySplus}

since the S-Plus code I would like to put in Verbatim environment uses
various type of characters except @ and back-tick.

Could anyone tell me how to enable the back-tick as a command
character?

Thank you, in advance.

Below is a file I got from somewhere for mailing labels, which
sounds like what you need.  I didn't write it, but I use it, and
modified it a bit.  The only problem I find is that for easy mailing I
wish the labels were sorted in columns instead of rows.

% label.tex, Russell Brown (rbrown@ms.uky.edu)

% Change the "\input filename" to whatever you call your
% particular file

% The following is a format for printing mailing labels. To use, set
% the following six dimensions, 
%
% \nrows = number of rows
% \ncols = number of columns
% \vcorner= vertical distance from top of page to top of first label
% \hcorner = horizontal distance from left edge of page to left edge of label
% \hlabel = horizontal width of label
% \vlabel = vertical height of label
%
% \hfudge = correction to make the horizontal alignment to work out correctly
% \vfudge = correction to make the vertical alignment to work out correctly
%
% These last two lengths require some experimenting.
%
% To type the labels, use the macro \lb which takes one argument, the
% entire address with lines separated by \\. 
% Example \lb{line1 \\line2\\line3}
%
% If a label has too many lines,
% it will throw off the alignment of subsequent labels.  
%
% In practice, you will want vcorner and hcorner to be larger than the
% physical corner in order that the address is not put right at the
% edge of the label.

I tried it. When some scrips added, for example
loading picture added in labels.tex, the browser said
warnning message that means like the document is old. 
 I wrote a email to Russell Brown. He gave me some
suggestions. Now I tried to find a little bit new
sample about sticky label templates. Until Now I
didn't get it. I found a article about 'A Package for
Making Sticky Labels in LaTeX' written in 1995. But I
didn't know if is OK for new version TeX (Web2C 7.4.5)
3.14159.

Any suggestion will be appreciated.

Thanks

you're doing it right, up to the point you mention it a second time.
the command characters have to be three different ones,

so \DefineVerbatimEnvironment{MySplus}{Verbatim}{commandchars=@`'}

would work.  the requirement comes from the way tex decodes arguments:
i can think of no way fancyverb could be made to work like with the
same character substituting for both { and }

the full syntax for \parbox (and minipage) is

\parbox[position][height][inner position]{width}{text}

If I remember correctly, the cyrplain bundle contains a plainenc.tex that  
allows you to use the LaTeX inputenc.sty in plain TeX. You might have fun  
playing with that. Note that the simple
     \catcode `?=\active
     \def ?{\~{n}}
is likely to blow up if you try to move the information around.

\catcode ? = \active
\def ?}{\?a}

\parbox [position]{width}{\vbox to <height>{\hsize = <width><text>\vss}}

Of course, the latter can't prevent text which won't fit within
the parbox from overprinting other material, but the parbox itself
will be the right size even if its contents aren't !

Message-ID: <20041103182419.GA2420@(none)>

Hi !

I'me really enjoying the practicallity of the multicol package.

I've got a trouble in handling the \columnseprule command. My whole document
is without vertical rules (using \setlength{\columnseprule}{0pt}), and I've
got a section that would need one.
I've tried
\setlength{\columnseprule}{1pt} after the \begin{multicol}
or
simply \columnseprule 1pt

but after compiling OK ... no effect.

Thanks to help me in switching on the columnseprule only for a part in the
document.

Francisco,

I sometimes use accented characters in LaTeX (at least in Italian; all 
accented vowels should work like in Spanish, I guess the \~n should work 
as well).

I have to start my latex source file by:

\documentclass[12pt]{article} % or whatever ...
\usepackage[italian]{babel} % that's for the hyphenation etc, not for the accents
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc} % This is the all important line

You may have to try other options, rather than "latin1", but inputenc is 
the package you actually need.

Hasta pronto,

Giuseppe.

i do: \includegraphics[figure]{figure.pdf}, and the figure appears to be
sitting on a black background in a pdflatex/foiltex-generated pdf.  is
this in fact called a 'background'?  can this color be manipulated?

No, latin1 supports Spanish and it doesn't make sense to try anything
else (except latin9, which is quite similar but contains the Euro symbol).

The question was how to do it in plain TeX.  And this is the reason
some people provided solutions which looked a bit more inconvenient
than LaTeX's inputenc.

Regards,
  Reinhard

\begin{center} starts a new paragraph.  Use \centering instead.

remove the \\, as another poster noted center starts a new paragraph, and 
issues extra vertical spacing which means the \\ aren't necessary

Bryan,
Here are some ideas - I'm not a graphicx guru, but this may set you on
the right track.

Lots of figures from various applications don't set specifically the
foreground color, at least initially (and these days default to a
transparent background). So if you are using bits of colour (e.g.,
making a presentation) you can find either strange or wonderful effects
where if your presentation is light text on a dark background, in your
figure (or part of it) the slide background shows through, while the
text (or part of it) instead of being black is your (light) text colour.
These are easily curable by defining the text colour to be black and
putting the image inside a colorbox, e.g.:

{\color{black}  % foreground/text colour now black
  \colorbox{white}{\includegraphics{figure.pdf}}
      % white box containing fig
}

What I don't know is whether \colorbox redefines the "background" colour
or simply lays down a box and colors it in. Thus this may not cure a
"black background". I also don't know what your [figure] option does, as
it's not in the graphicx docs.

Message-ID: <20041105225413.FIGN2430.imf22aec.mail.bellsouth.net@mail.bellsouth.net>

Hello,

I would like to know how to manipulate latex in such a way to include
a reference after \subsection{} on the same line?

This is what I would like to accomplish:

\subsection (or \chapter or \section) then have the \cite on the same
line then continue with the rest of the text as the normal subsection
format (i.e. a line below).

This is how I would like it to look:

1.1.2 Amplifier Design(Subsection Font) [2](body font)

Body Text


Anytime I try to place the \cite command, the only way I know how
(i.e. within the \subsection environment to be on the same line), it
shows up in the table of contents (which I don't want!) and also shows
up as the same font as the \subsection.

PLEASE HELP!!!!

Sincerely,
Rajesh

you have just gotten your answer on comp.text.tex

just to recap:

\subsection[toc and header text]{subsection title}

\cite should go in the {...} bit and you *have* to remember the [...] part

i am stuck on these two related problems:

1.  getting pdflatex/foiltex to use the picture environment with just like
it does without foiltex.  letters and boxes for example are out of
proportion relative to no foiltex.

.... AND.......

2.  cropping pdflatex-generated figures.  for instance, i have a figure in
latex using the figure and picture environments i want to put in my
pdflatex/foiltex document. latex->dvips->epstopdf is perfect except for
the shabby-looking text.  pdflatex->epstopdf is perfect, except the
dimensions of the figure (if that's the correct way to say it) are too
large, and it ends up on another slide.

i also don't know enough about graphicx/graphic enviroments to make these
figures stay on one slide.  

btw, thanks to Steve Schwartz for tips on using graphic environment w/
foiltex.

\geometry{

Subject: [texhax] Enumerating sentences in arguments to macros
Message-ID: <41908B69.1070109@ing.hj.se>

Hi all.

I'm trying to make some LaTeX-macros and would like to extract the first 
sentence of an argument to my macro. Is it possible to somehow enumerate 
the sentences in an argument?

What I currently have:
\newcommand{\mycommand}[1]
{
	...
	\someothercommand{#1}
	...
}

What I want:
\newcommand{\mycommand}[1]
{
	...
	\someothercommand[<First sentence from #1 up to first ".")>]{#1}
	...
	\someothercommand[<Second sentence from #1 from first "." up to second 
".">]{#1}
}

If someone could offer hints or suggestions on how to accomplish this, 
it would be most appreciated. Or just point me to the appropriate 
LaTeX-FAQ entry and make a snide remark about my obvious lack of skills 
in searching documentation.

Thanks

You could go Plain TeX a bit, using something like

\def\mycommand#1.#2\mystop%
	{first sentence = #1.  Oh, and here's the rest = #2}

Then this should act more or less like

\mycommand Blah. Blih. Bluh.\mystop

would print

first sentence = Blah.  Oh, and here's the rest = Blih. Bluh.

Notice that \mystop does not need to be defined, and any other suitable 
delimiter could be used instead.  When \mycommand runs, it reads 
everything up to "." as the first arg, then everything up to \mystop as 
the second arg. Both the first period and \mystop are gobbled in the 
process (and thus you need to provide the period again).

Did you load pstricks and pstcol before egameps?

I did not know that.  It seems thet you know more than me.  What I'm
wondering is whether "Meta" is his wife or his girl friend.

    I did not know that.  

I'm not sure, but I think I remember seeing "TeX the lion" mentioned.
Can't remember the specifics.  Either that or no name at all?  I can ask
Duane next time we discuss a drawing :).

    What I'm wondering is whether "Meta" is his wife or his girl friend.

Well, I don't remember any marriage ceremony :).  I kind of thought they
might be siblings.  Or are there drawings of an, um, romantic nature
that I'm forgetting?

Since Don Knuth is the father of both, they by definition are siblings. 
However, the illustration for TUG in the TeXbook seems to indicate 
clones, but they are all guys (so maybe Meta is dating one of them).

And another naming question. We know TeX is pronounced as in Texas,
but is that the Spanish or the English pronunciation?

The books say, as in Spanish, but with names like latex, I wonder if
people face-to-face actually say it the way it is supposed to be said.

In TeX 'X' stands for Greek letter chi and so is pronounced as strong
'h', or [kh].

if they're clones, perhaps poor old meta is dating the lot, without

who says "as in texas"?  i've never encountered that claim.

in the book, don says it's derived from greek chi (which looks like an
x); chi has a variously gutteral sound in greek pronunciation, but don
characterises it by comparison with various nordic languages, and with
the celtic "ch" sound in loch.

according to don, the name's chosen on the basis of the greek word
\tau\varepsilon\chi\nu\iota.  that word came up yesterday in my greek
lesson as "art" in the gallery sense, but it also means "craft" and
would be applied to typography.

while some people do insist on saying latex as if it were an english
word, most make the gutteral sound at the end, though there's a
significant minority who use a soft "ch" sound.  (michel goossens does
that, for example.  he wouldn't, i imagine, if he came from north
holland, but he's a belgian fleming.)

Message-ID: <156038A5123A7F43B4357AAEB498AF57A5A8D8@ulm002.vs.dasa.de>

Hi,

At this moment I'm going to use gloss.sty for automatically creating
separate lists for abbreviations (LOA) and for symbols (LOS).
When reading the manual I found in section 4.3 the macro \gloss,
which may be used with different <name>-options. Alas, trying this
I encountered the following problem. 

Running the enclosed example file through latex results in an error.

! Undefined control sequence.
\\printgloss <\\printgloss>  ...ate \write \csname glsf@\gls@name
                                                   \endcsname 
{\string \bibda...
l.17  \printgloss[List of Abbreviations]{LOA}

Probably there is something wrong in my approach, but I've no
idea what! Your help is appreciated.
 
TIA,

J?rgen

Perhaps the _Spanish_ pronounciation of Texas? I believe in Spanish the x is 
more like the ch in loch, but I'm not sure.

Don also compares the sound to the German "ach", if I recall correctly. 
However, though the German language has both the gutteral ("ach") and the 
'soft "ch sound' ("ich"), there are very hard linguistic rules about their 
use, depending on the preceding vowel:

A "ch" after an "i" or "e" is always soft ("ich", "Pech"), and a "ch" after an 
"a", "o" or "u" is always gutteral ("Bach", "Koch", "Tuch") The Umlauts "?" 
"?" and "?" affect the "ch" like the first group, too ("B?che", "K?che", 
"T?cher").

So despite the "TeX -> ach" ruling, all German users will always pronounce TeX 
and LaTeX with a soft "ch". I'm not as familiar with Flemish, but I can 
imagine similar rules exist, making it "unnatural" to use a gutteral "ch" 
there.

So if I try something like this, it doesn't work.

\def\frsts#1.#2\mystop%
     {#1}

\newcommand{\firstsentence}[1]
{
	\frsts #1\mystop
}

Error messages talks about runaway arguments. Can it be fixed somehow? 
I've tried putting braces and dots around the arguments in various ways,

Always make sure that whatever you feed into \firstsentence actually 
contains a period.  Otherwise, \frstst keep increasing its #1, waiting 
for a dot to tell it to stop gathering stuff in #1.

i don't think don actually mentions the word.  i only _heard_ it
yesterday, and modern greek (as you probably know) makes no
distinction between iota, eta, upsilon, and the epsilon-iota and
omicron-iota digraphs.

so that's my excuse.  you are of course right ;-)

Ah, at last an explanation : I /could/ not undertsand why I heard
"tesch" so often at my early European TeX meetings; now all is clear!
Many thanks, Benjamin.

Now here's another pronunciation question : what fraction of the readers of
TeXhax pronounce "gigabyte" with a soft "g" (my preference), what fraction
with a hard "g" (the preference of most of my colleagues), and what fraction
with an aspirated "g" (recognising the Greek etymology) ?

I can't address your gloss.sty question, since I don't see what's the
matter, but I thought you should know there is a package called
acronym.sty specifically designed to deal with managing acronyms and
creating a list of their definitions.  It was a great help to us.  I
think it's on CTAN.

Why aspirated?  Ancient Greek has a pairing of unvoiced
kappa and aspirate unvoiced khi, but no pairing for the
voiced gamma. Modern Greek produces a breathy sound for
a gamma before a back vowel "a" "o" "u" (spelled omicron-upsilon)
but has a strong tendenscy to palatalize gamma before "i" "e"

So one would expect either GiGa-, plain voiced G, or, in a more
modern version YiGHa-byte.  For my part, I say GiGabyte, but
I could see an argument for the civilized old 18th and 19th
century British habit, which has no truck with silly foreign
sounds and would prefer JIgabyte, assuming that the neologism
was felt to be legitimate at all

you say what gets you understood.  the only thing knuth actually
forbids is sounding the x like an english x.  (and, pace the
discussion on comp.text.tex about whether one should obey knuth's
instructions, you can take that as you choose.)

personally, i don't like that pronunciation, but then i have a
well-developed talent for mimicry and was taught how to mimic germans
at a young age...

I use the soft "g" (jiga), but none of my colleagues (I'm an electrical 
engineer in the US) do.  The hard g sounds silly, to me. I learned the 
pronunciation from reading, before memory, etc, required such large 
prefices.

Reader,

Please realize I am clueless about what WinTeX is, and how to use it.  I
have been asked by a boss of mine to research a problem she is facing.
Here goes my explanation:

As soon as we upgraded her version of WinTeX to the newest version last
May, she started getting "%%@" placed in her .tex files all over the
place when viewed in Notepad, Wordpad, etc..

When she saves files and tries to have her colleague view them, he
cannot anymore.

Lastly, there are problems compiling the code when figures are included.

Please help!  Thanks so much.

In Mexico, yes ---with a ``soft'' ch (as in ``ich''), as mentioned by 
Benjamin Deutsch in this thread---, but not in other Spanish speaking 
countries. A few centuries ago the X was used in Spanish for the 
phoneme /kh/ (with its Andalusian ---``soft''--- and Castilian 
---guttural--- variances). In Mexico we keep that sound in some 
toponyms: Mexico /me'-khi-ko/, Texas /te'-khas/.

In modern days Spanish, the phoneme /kh/ is represented with the letter 
J, that's why until a few years ago in other Spanish-speaking countries 
``M?jico'' was the only accepted form to write the name of Mexico, now 
they are more condescending with us.

Best regards,

Axel

Let me try this again; don't know why texhax didn't like my message.

Donn,

I'm not sure what the class and style packages you have gotten from FIT 
look like, but we have a really good package here at GaTech you can 
download

http://www.grad.gatech.edu/thesis/templates.html

If you look at the comments in the gatech-thesis-losa.sty file, it 
explains pretty well.  If you use that package (and I'm not sure how 
compatible it will be with the FIT thesis class), just make sure to 
\usepackage{gatech-thesis-losa} and define the file with your losa 
definitions as \losafiles{your-losa-file}, where you have a file 
your-losa-file.bib with entries like

@gd{gammaprime,
	word={$\gamma~^{\prime}$},
	sort={gammaprime},
	definition={Strengthening precipitate phase}
}

Not sure exactly how you specify where the LOSA shows up -- that's 
embedded in the gatech-thesis.cls file somewhere, but I believe it's 
called in essentially the same way as a glossary.

This does not mean that I will not buy them, but I'd like to ask how the

I'm a (below?) average LaTeX user, with some basic knowledge about TeX,

Then buy The LaTeX Companion, 2. edition. If you're using LaTeX and not 
that experinced, you don't need to learn about TeX at this momemnt.

Lamports book is from 1994 and much has happened since (more packages).

Therefore I would say that TLC2 is the best buy at the moment.

Stefan,

Depending on what you want to learn eventually, you might choose
either the TeXBook for in depth knowledge or one (several) of LaTeX
Companions. I've bought the TeXBook and read it through, but cannot
say it helped me much in the everyday LaTeX usage.

Happy TeXing,

KK.

I've put forth a special effort to collect free texts on typography, 
and a few of these are on-line manuals TeX.

http://members.aol.com/willadams/books-free-type.html

The one thing I need to add here and below is the manual for booktabs.

There's also a page w/ TeX specific texts (ob. discl. I'm an Amazon 
Associate and may profit)

If you are interested in a systematic introduction to LaTeX I would
recommend you have a look at Lamport's book first. Then, you should
read the LaTeX Companion. 

You should also have a look at the free tutorials available on the
web:

Thanks!

As I've noted previously. Between the available on-line documentation, 
the excellent FAQ, and a judicious use of http://groups.google.com 
searching the archives of the usenet newsgroup comp.text.tex I've been 
able to solve pretty much every LaTeX problem I've ever encountered.

Things which one can't find using the above references typically 
involve:

  - consulting the source (typeset yourself a copy of source2e.pdf)
  - doing independent research 'cause it's not been solved yet
  - finding better search terms 'cause you're using the wrong search 
terms

Subject: [texhax] book documentstyle, and pstricks
Message-ID: <19AE04BC-34D8-11D9-B403-000A957AC34A@tufts.edu>

I have two unrelated questions.

1. In the book documentstyle, is there a macro for creating a preface 
or other front matter
that precedes the table of contents, and perhaps appears on pages with 
lowercase roman
numeration?  I found in the TeX Companion a reference (in the Babel 
section) to \prefacename, but my version of LaTeX (downloaded recently 
in connection with TeXShop) doesn't recognize a "preface" environment.

2. Is there more detailed documentation than in the TeX Graphics 
Companion on producing letters in pstricks
like the "LATEX" one on p. 112?  I want to generate a title on the 
title page of a book in the kind of very large letters that appear in 
that example.  When I attempted to mimic the code given there, I got 
letters only slightly larger than those using \Huge inside the title, 
and
(1) if included in the title (as a pspicture, centered) it put all of 
the rest of the material below the middle of the page, while if I put 
it outside the title, then I got my letters at the top of the page and 
the rest of the stuff off the page.

Thanks for any help.

No help with pstricks, but if you want big letters, you can also do
this:

  \newcommand{\HUGE}{\@setfontsize\HUGE{100}{105}}

That might be an easier way to do what you want.

William, thanks for providing this, it's really great.

Stefan, it's difficult to recommend a book for you because you are
neither a beginner nor someone who already knows everything.

My suggestion is to look at the texmf/doc directory first. If you are
using teTeX or TeXLive, you certainly have a program called texdoctk.
Try it.

If you decided to use LaTeX, it's better not to read the TeXbook.  TeX
and LaTeX are two different things.

I think that almost all the information you need is already on your
system (in texmf/doc).  If you want to buy a book about LaTeX, I
recommend "The LaTeX Companion", ***second*** edition.  It's not less
expensive than the books you mentioned, but I can assure that it's
worth the money.

But make sure that it is the second edition.

Regards,
  Reinhard

IMO TeX for the Impatient is quite good.
And The LaTeX Companion is indispensible!

Try this:

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand\makelabel[1]{\hss\llap{S#1}}
\item One Thing
\item Another Thing
\item Yet Another Thing
\end{enumerate}

Also a look at Robin Fairbairns' FAQ would also find reference to the
enumerate and enumitem packages, which allow flexibility in lists.

Sirs,

  A journal (Journal of Financial Economics) does NOT want hyphenation. Unfortunately, TeX hyphenates so well that forcing no hyphenation using: 
 
    \hyphenpenalty=10000 
\exhyphenpenalty=10000 

causes the tolerance to be exceeded and nasty blocks placed at the end of the line where hyphenation should occur. Is there any way to get TeX to not hyphenate and still leave the text without the nasty blocks at the end of the line and still get reasonable looking output? Any help here? bye ...

Dear all,

This Saturday, Nov 20, starting at 08.00 MET, the central DAIMI server 
room will be shut down in order to install an UPS (emergency power supply).
The electricians will probably finish their work within a couple of
hours. Afterwards, the servers will have to be restarted. Additionally,
the mail filtering machine will be upgraded. It is therefore difficult
to give an exact estimate of the total duration of the service interruption.

so what do the journal of financial economics want instead?  the
alternatives are ragged-right text (like some newspapers --
\raggedright) or text with uneven spacing (like the rest of newspapers
-- \sloppy).  there really aren't any alternatives (short of rewriting
text so that it doesn't _need_ hyphenation, which is always tedious
and most often difficult or even impossible).

the difference between tex and most other systems is that it gives you
a choice when things become impossibly bad.  faced with a text that
would naturally appear bad, tex makes it look bad and expects you to
sort it out.

Hmm, that last is in the public domain --- anyone know if it's 
available on-line?

A cursory search doesn't show it.

Anyway, like the old saying goes, ``quick, cheap, good --- pick any 
two''. Similarly, as Robin noted, for setting text, you've got to 
compromise on something --- either you hyphenate to keep lines looking 
decent, re-write the text, or accept that occasionally w/ /sloppy & the 
like thing will be ugly.

You can set \pretolerance=10000 (this also disables hyhpenation without
needing the above settings) but you may end up with many underfull lines
which can look rather ugly.  It might look better than those overfull lines,
though.

[By the way, this isn't mentioned in FAQ-hyphoff.html if anyone cares...]

indeed.  there was some discussion (probably on c.t.t), in the period
running up to me writing hyphoff, which had me thinking that
\pretolerance=\infty isn't a good solution.  however, i can't now
remember what the reasoning was...

so i go to google groups.  look at

http://www.google.com/groups?q=%5Cpretolerance+hyphenation+group:comp.text.tex&hl=en&lr=&selm=17SEP199618292218%40reg.triumf.ca&rnum=1

there donald arseneau highlights the words ("essentially always") in
the texbook that were niggling at me when i was trying to recall the
problem with this use of \pretolerance.

that post has a paragraph with \pretolerance=10000 and lots of nice
hyphenation.

it would be nice to explain why these things aren't the answer, in the
faq, but it's confusing enough already.  maybe one day, "footnotes to
the faq" ...

Hi,

Can anyone guide me to the solution of the following problem?

The example doesn't show the required result (the argument 
of the \item is hidden).

\documentclass{scrartcl}
\usepackage{listings}
\begin{document}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item[\lstinline{ze_def.h}] ZE-spezifische Definitionen
 \end{itemize}
\end{document}

What do I have to do to get the correct result?  I tried already
\item[\protect\lstinline{bar}] and something like this without
getting any improvement.
 
Section 5.1 in the well written manual doesn't help me, too.

TIA,

this is all very well ... i can download this stuff once-off and
install it on my web page and refer people to it.  but where is there
a copy that i can sensibly link to from the faq, say?  all these
splendid bits and pieces on sarovar are fine, but they're only really
there for us geeks ... the impatient masses are unlikely to accept a
<xyz repository> project reference.

which is one of the reasons ctan exists...

That's interesting, thanks.  It turns out that the two flaws with this
approach are: (a) it doesn't use \emergencystretch, and (b) if a line
is totally impossible (i.e., too long) to set without hyhpenation then
it will go ahead and hyphenate it anyway (together with the rest of the
paragraph).

So the solution should be:
 \hyphenpenalty=10000      %% or any of the other ways
 \exhyphenpenalty=10000    %% to turn hyphenation off
 \pretolerance=9999
 \tolerance=\pretolerance
 \emergencystretch=10pt    % it may be necessary to experiment with this value.

The OP in this thread wasn't told to use \emergencystretch, and it isn't
in the FAQ either.  It's what helps TeX to stop setting overfull lines
without using the rather wild spacing that can sometimes happen with
\pretolerance=10000.

I suspect it's a bug or at any rate \lstinline is not supposed to be used
there.

Look at what this gets you:

 \begin{itemize}
  \item[\lstinline!ze_def.h!] ZE-spezifische Definitionen
  \item
 \end{itemize}

Why not try the package author?

One question --- why is it better to set this as a penalty as opposed 
to just setting the hyphenchar to -1? Or does doing so alter this?

No reason - I copied that bit from the original poster in this thread.

However, it may be noted that setting \hyphenchar to -1 has to be
done for all fonts used in the text that is to be dehyphenated.

Message-ID: <91406D0EA0DA12438993E9CF22CBD61F01EE96E3@it013.mbc.com>

I'm trying to include dice in a probability document but I cannot get the
\Cube symbol to work.

By having 
\usepackage[misc]{ifsym}
in the preamble, and 
$P(\Cube{5} \cup \Cube{6})$
in the document it runs without error, but does not return dice.  Rather it
returns an upper case Greek Psi for \Cube{5} and an upper case Omega for
\Cube{6}.

I tried using a different group, i.e. [alpine] and the symbol \Tent returned
what looks to be a slashed zero (it could be a lower case Greek Phi) rather
than a tent figure.

I tried without math mode ($) but I get an error.  Has anyone experience
with ifsym, especially \Cube for dice?  Any thoughts are greatly
appreciated.

\Cube is coded as a text-only command.

the following should work

  \usepackage{amsmath}
  ...
  $P(\text{\Cube{5}} \cup \text{\Cube{6}})$

(not actually tested, mind you)

I don't have time to look at this, but as far as I remember, listings
plays with the catcodes of characters at input (what mostly all verbatim
environments do), thus, if you are trying to use a listing anywhere, but
at the top level of macro expansion, it will not work (because catcodes
will already have been defined for the characters to input).

Just my guess,

What you can do is something like

\newsavebox\JGbox

\sbox\JGbox{\lstinline!ze_def.h!}
\item[\usebox\JGbox]

You can do it with PSTricks, using the package pst-grad.sty or pst-slpe. 
For instructions on the usage of the first package see the second

I'm attempting to write my first latex package and I want to redefine some
commands that are built in to tex.  For this package they will not be
missed; never the less, I'm still saving the default commands so that
users will be able to access them.  For example, the \S command (a little
curly notation) has been redefined as follows:

\let\defaultS\S   %save the \S command in \defaultS
\renewcommand{\S}{\mathsf{S}} %renew \S to what I want

which works fine, EXCEPT for two instances and I don't know why; I have
the following

\let\defaultOE\OE
\renewcommand{\OE}{\ensuremath{\mathsf{OE}}}

and

\let\defaultL\L
\renewcommand{\L}{\ensuremath{\mathsf{L}}}

but neither redefinition works; the use of \defaultL works, but the
renewal of the command itself does not; I still get the default typeset of
these two characters, \L and \OE

What am I doing wrong?

Put this in your preamble; it'll do what you ask, but also for tables(!) and
only provided you're not using any fancy packages that already interfere
with captions.

\makeatletter
\long\def\@makecaption#1#2{%
  \vskip\abovecaptionskip
%%%  \sbox\@tempboxa{#1: #2}% ORIGINAL
  \sbox\@tempboxa{#2}%
  \ifdim \wd\@tempboxa >\hsize
%%%    #1: #2\par % ORIGINAL
    #2\par
  \else
    \global \@minipagefalse
    \hb@xt@\hsize{\hfil\box\@tempboxa\hfil}%
  \fi
  \vskip\belowcaptionskip}
\makeatother

You might want to look at the "ccaption" package though, for more control.

I have now pinpointed the problem. The function \lst@Init contains many  
lines of which the following are important to our problem:

\def\lst@Init#1{%
  [...]
     \ifhmode\ifinner \lst@boxtrue \fi\fi
     \lst@ifbox
         \lsthk@BoxUnsafe% check
         \hbox to\z@\bgroup
              $\if t\lst@boxpos \vtop
         \else \if b\lst@boxpos \vbox
         \else \vcenter \fi\fi
         \bgroup \par\noindent
     \else
  [...]
}

The \par near the bottom of this snippet performs the action stored in the  
current \everypar, which means that this special \everypar sets some  
switches globally so that when \everypar is restored by listings later on,  
it already thinks everything was done! The end result is missing output.  
However the fix is quite easy, as one just have to add

\def\lst@Init#1{%
  [...]
     \ifhmode\ifinner \lst@boxtrue \fi\fi
     \lst@ifbox
         \lsthk@BoxUnsafe% check
         \hbox to\z@\bgroup
              $\if t\lst@boxpos \vtop
         \else \if b\lst@boxpos \vbox
         \else \vcenter \fi\fi
         \bgroup \everypar{}%% <- This single |\everypar{}|.
           \par\noindent
     \else
  [...]
}

Voila!

I'm cc'ing Carsten Heinz just in case.

Thanks for all of you to help me.

The ulem does work, but I found that it can not work well with Chinese(I must insert a space between tow words in order to break line).Can somebody adapt it to Chinese? And soul can not work with CJK, I can not kown the reason.

Surely such a \par at the beginning of a vertical list (as in the example)
does almost nothing!

It is the \noindent that triggers the \everypar.

Subject: [texhax] how to let "ulem" or "soul" work with CJK
Message-ID: <Bs958878775168.18080@webmail3.inner-21cn.com>

I want to underline words which pass through several lines.
I am using the "ulem" package, and I found that I must insert a space
between two chinese words to let "ulem" break the line(It is not 
nesessary for me to do so in other cases). And the "soul" package 
conflicts with CJK. What can I do to let "ulem" or "soul" word properly 
with CJK.

Would you like to tell us what it is you do that actually gets the error
message?  If I just load the packages (I have pretty much up-to-date
versions) as per your example, I don't get any error message.

Try leafing through symbols-a4.pdf (or symbols-letter.pdf); it's in
...\texmf\doc\guides\symbols\ in MiKTeX.  If you can't find anything there,
then your only hope will be a commercial font set.

Thank you to Philip Ratcliffe and Lars Madsen for your suggestions. Much
appreciated.

By the appearance of the \mathscr{ABC} on page 40 of symbols-a4.pdf I
am sure that \mathscr{L} should do the trick.

I have loaded mathrsfs.sty and and ursfs.fd on the same directory as a
file with the following snippet of latex code:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{mathrsfs}
\begin{document}
$\mathscr{L}$
\end{document}

I get the error message:
 Font U/rsfs/m/n/10=rsfs10 at 10.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file
not found

Any further suggestions ?

Thanks very much

Hello.


I have started using LATEX just a few weeks ago for university use 
(Student).
I tried to use the pstricks package to draw some plots. Indeed it 
worked great, I just cant see any lines or graphs inside the picture.
Please finde below one of the examples of www.tug.org. I just created a 
new dokument and built the attached pdf file.
Please have a look at it. Something is wrong.

Can you help me with that? What is wrong?

Used Example:
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{pst-plot,pstricks}
\begin{document}

base line \rule{4em}{0.5pt}
\psframebox[boxsep=0,linestyle=dashed,linewidth=0.1pt]{%
   \begin{pspicture}(-1,-2)(3,2)
     \psaxes{->}(0,0)(-1,-2)(3,2)
   \end{pspicture}}
\rule{4em}{0.5pt} base line

See the log file. It says something like

Googling for that will take you to

Another possibility: try the image at http://tug.org/protext.

This is built on miktex, but has an installation guide which may be

Have you converted the dvi output into a ps file?? PSTricks graphics are not

Your problem is that you're running pdflatex which can't support pstricks  
natively because pstricks needs postscript. Thus you need help from some  
tricky package like pdftricks or ps4pdf.

You might find people who can help you out with all these things under  
TeXShop on the Mac OSX mailing list. You can find it at

\vector admits fewer slope arguments than \line, namely only up to 4.  
That is, \vector(4,3) works, \vector(5,3) does not.

To get rid of all such restrictions, you can download the new (Summer 
2004) pict2e package from, say, CTAN.  Note that pict2e will only 
produce results via dvips or pdftex, as it dumps the workload on 
postscript or pdf. In any case, pict2e allows happy commands like 
\vector(356,234){10}, and has a few other goodies.

A far simpler solution than pict-2e (since it produces standard dvi
output) is to install xy-pic.  It uses its own font (which is installed
along with the package) to make lines and arrows at any slope with a
circular resolution of better than 1 degree (360/512 to be exact).  For
producing commutative diagrams, I would further recommend my diagxy, which
is a front end to xy-pic.  The latter is, of course, only my personal 
opinion.

Message-ID: <286092086.20041130111456@econ.usyd.edu.au>

I have had no luck with a simple task, despite checking FAQ and a
couple of books.

I want the tables in my appendix to have the caption Table A1 etc
Table A2 etc.

I have tried the appendix package, but it does not provide this
functionality.

I have come across some syntax for figure numbers in
floats:

\renewcommand{\fnum@figure}{\texbf{Fig.~\thefigure}}

and tried my own version (without success):

\renewcommand{\tnum@table}{\texbf{Table A~\thetable}}

My invention of tnum@table (not knowing the correct term) may be the
problem.

Any suggestions would be most welcome.

  I have partly answered my own question:

  \renewcommand{\tnum@table}{\texbf{Table A~\thetable}}

  should have used fnum, not tnum (presumably fnum stands for float
  number, not figure number).

  I have got it to work fine with fnum, with the tables within the
  text showing Table A1 etc. But I still have a problem in
  that the List of Tables, does not reflect these changes, but shows
  Table 1 etc.  Do I need to redefine the list of tables command? And
  if so, how might I do it?

  Any advice would be most appreciated.

  I have also started looking at ccaption package, to see if this will
  automate the whole thing.

since you want the table number referred in the same where wherever it
occurs, you probably need just to change \thetable at the start of the
appendices (thus avoiding all that fiddling with \makeatletter).

however, there's a slight confusion: you mention "table a1" but in
your command you have a space between appendix number and table
number.  so, does \renewcommand\thetable{\thechapter\thetable}
(without fiddling with \fnum@table) do what you want?

(i'm presuming -- you don't say in this post and i've now deleted the
earlier one -- that it's a chapter-based document.  otherwise use
\thesection in place of \thechapter.)

I don't understand ... isn't that the default for the book class?
You mean you do not want the dot (i.e. A2 instead of A.2)?

this is an evidence of distraction on my part, leading to stupidity.
(never type responses early in the morning when suffering an arthritis
flare.)

\renewcommand\thetable{\thechapter\arabic{table}}

or, if you don't mind going down one level and using internal commands

\renewcommand\thetable{\thechapter\@arabic\c@table}

(which is "expandable" -- useful in some circumstances.)

Message-ID: <41ACD366.6050909@raggmunk.nu>

I'd like to typeset the ? (1/2) character (using latin1 inputencoding), 
but LaTeX does not use font. Instead, it is converted to $\frac12$, 
which places the numbers vertically positioned divided by a horizontal 
line (as i should, of course).

a) Can I tell LaTeX to use the font (T1 encoding) that is available in 
the postscript font file, or

b) is there some kind of math formula that creates a fraction with a 
diagonal line instead of a horizontal?

Stefan
