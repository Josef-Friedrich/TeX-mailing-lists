Subject: [texhax] rotated tables and (TeX+Ghostscript) vs. (PDFTex)
Message-ID: <20040801020753.90013.qmail@web41905.mail.yahoo.com>

hello everyone,

i'm having trouble inserting a very wide table using
the rotating package and the sidewaystable
environment. i am using TeXShop and the latest teTeX
distribution on a mac (OS 10.3.4). the relevant bits
of my preamble are as follows:

\usepackage[dvips]{graphics}
\usepackage{epsfig,subfigure,rotating,latexsym}
\usepackage[bf]{caption2}
\usepackage{color,times,graphicx,psfrag,fp}
\usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc}

and the table is inserted as:

\begin{sidewaystable}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{||l||ccc|ccc|c|c||}
  a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h & $\ldots$ 
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Caption text}
  \label{table:big_table}
\end{sidewaystable}

if i typeset the document using Pdftex, the table
looks fine, and gets placed on a page by itself as
expected, but none of my EPS figures get rendered. if
instead i typeset using TeX+Ghostscript, all the
figures look fine, but now the table does not get
rotated and runs off the side of its page -- it's as
if the rendering is done assuming landscape mode, but
the page remains in portrait.

the problem is that almost all of my figures are EPS
(matlab figures, etc.), and i make extensive use of
the psfrag package to replace text labels throughout
the document. so converting all the EPS figures to PDF
is not an option (psfrag won't work in that case).

i found robin fairbairns's post from a few months ago
suggesting that the rotating and graphicx packages are
incompatible in some sense (for reasons having to do
with the latter redefining \includegraphics), but i
removed graphicx and it didn't help. i also saw this
post from bruno voisin on this exact subject:

http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~pku/MacOSX_TeX/2003a/msg00985.html

but found no followups on how to resolve the problem. 

so i'm stuck. does anyone have any suggestions on how
to get this table to rotate without messing up the
figures?

many thanks in advance,

HJ

Subject: [texhax] Citations as footnotes?
Message-ID: <F19E370C-E3EC-11D8-9A27-000393D6572C@cybermesa.com>


Hi,

I was wondering if there is a way to place citations as footnotes. For 
example, if you had two or three citations on a page, those citations 
would appear on that page itself (assuming that was the first 
citation). Subsequent citations in later pages would refer to the 
``footnote" number on the earlier page.

I have seen this done in some books, but browsing around I could not 
find a way to do this with
the standard bibliography styles. I have the latest distribution of 
teTex.

Any help or pointers in this regard would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Dilip

Maybe it's a good idea to look at the following packages at well:

<CTAN>/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfslide
<CTAN>/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfscreen

seminar.cls uses PostScript \specials and you probably need pdftricks
to make it work if you want to produce PDF.

An other (non-LaTeX) way to produce slides is to use Context, see

Message-ID: <176FDD8DC56B4946946917ECEBA4DA5501DE94F0@MSGBOSCLA2WIN.DMN1.FMR.COM>

Summary:
It seems that the hyphenation approach used by TeX fails to insert
any hyphens in many words.  Or am I doing something wrong?

Details:
I am not a user of TeX but simply using its code that hyphenate words.
I think I am using the standard set of rules in the ushyph1.tex file.
(I used these via the Perl module TeX::Hyphen .)
I ran this on a large word list (the YAWL list
http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/yawl-0.3.tar.gz
reachable from e.g.
http://personal.riverusers.com/~thegrendel/software.html ).
I discovered that for many words, even long words with many syllables,
it does not insert any hyphens (actually, possible hyphenation points).

Here are some examples or words that have no hyphenation points:

whether achieved promised spokesman widespread database briefly princess
medicine surgery singing stronger sergeant lawyers guardian marginal
wildlife
refugees painful overnight essence tragedy monopoly molecules evenings
sovereign timetable lifestyle strongest marathon salaries manuscript
lunchtime providers archives aerospace headache bankrupt lightweight
monastery
paramount galaxy wheelchair exquisite paradigm volatile postscript
hypocrisy
metaphors takeovers labyrinth stronghold monotonous grievance
wheelchairs
foothold fledgling prostaglandin trichloroethylenes

This is a actually a small subset. There are more than 20000 words
that I think should have at least one hyphenation point, but which do
not have any.

Is it really the case that TeX does not hyphenate these words?
Or am I doing something wrong.

I think the algorithm needs another step -- if the word is long enough
try harder to hyphenate.  
Possibly this could be done by adding more patterns, at a lower level
(i.e. smaller integer). 

P.S. I am sending essentially the same message a second time
because the first one was not put into the mailing list archive.
At http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2004-August/002484.html
it simply says: Skipped content of type multipart/alternative
and has no other content at all.  So I am sending this message
from Outlook with format "Plain Text".  Ideally the
mailing list archives would handle this better -- I believe
that one of the formats in the original message is plain text.

Thanks,
Steve

Message-ID: <341891429@web.de>

Hi to all!

I am looking for a source of information related to the following toppic:

I have to typeset a document in tex (using class book) which uses Times New Roman.
Therefore I am using the pslatex.sty.

The Problem is the font-size: I need 9.5pt an 11.5pt

Could anyone tell me how I can tell Tex to use those sizes?

Kind regards

Message-ID: <200408042055.i74Kt7F11484@f7.net>

    Is it really the case that TeX does not hyphenate these words?

I recognize a number of those as ones where TeX is known to miss the
hyphenation points, so I think the answer is yes, it's really the case.
Barbara Beeton has made collections of TeX hyphenation exceptions since
the beginning.

(We added a few of the most common exceptions in the recent update of
the TUGboat macros. :)

    I think the algorithm needs another step -- if the word is long enough
    try harder to hyphenate.  
    Possibly this could be done by adding more patterns, at a lower level

Additional patterns have already been written.  What are the results
with ushyph2.tex or ushyphen.max?  (I haven't used them, myself.)

The problem is always finding the good hyphens without allowing bad
hyphens -- much worse to include a bad hyphenation point than to miss a
good one.

    At http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2004-August/002484.html
    it simply says: Skipped content of type multipart/alternative

Indeed.  I'll look into it.  Unfortunately it seems to be in the mailman
code, not just a list configuration setting.

That's obsolete, I believe. Use mathptmx instead if it's supported by 
your tex distribution. You may have to add helv.sty to that if you need 
Helvetica as your sans.

Unfortunately, the FAQ doesn't have a good answer on this, closest is:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=extsizes

your tex distribution should include fntguide which has the answer in 
it, or do a search or download

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/fntguide.tex

You may want to think in terms of bp (PostScript points) instead of pt 
(Printer's points though)

Steve Tolkin's list is rather a challenge, and suggests that even the
patterns should be looked at again.  I do not remember what hyphenation
list was used to start the generation of hyphen.tex, but it seems to
have missed some real possibilities.  

     I run the risk of being shown up again as careless, but here is
my suggestion of patterns that might be safe (I have tried \showhyphens{}
on many of them to confirm that they are in truth not hyphenated.  Could 
it be that processor speed had something to do with a conservatism that
left many of the rarer possibilities out?)

whether achieved promised spokesman wid{e-spr}ead database briefly princess

wheelchairs
foothold fledg-ling prostaglandin trichloroethylenes

It ought to be pretty safe to make hypo, para, and even epi and apo
into pre-hyphen groups tied to start-of-word.

There are at least some consonant clusters here that could probably be
included in the patterns.  I have tried, for instance, to think of any
word that would be mishandled by making the "scr" grouping follow a
hyphen after any consonant.  Perhaps there is one. In any case,
all these words ought to be at least in the exceptions list.  At
present-day processor speeds, a larger exceptions list should
not be an impediment.  

I find it interesting that I have run into so few problems of this sort
in ten years of professional typesetting.  But I still think that
we might propose improvements in hyphens.tex to Don Knuth.

if i remember correctly, the word list used to detect
patterns was the american heritage dictionary.  that
was pretty comprehensive, although i know of at least
one pattern missed -- it appears in place names like
worces-ter, leices-ter, etc.  but place names aren't
usually in dictionaries, and it's usually considered
better practice to avoid hyphenating of proper names.

    [...]

some of the words in the list wouldn't be hyphenated in
"good" english typesetting because there wouldn't be
at least two letters before a hyphen at the beginning
of a word (achieved) or three after a hyphen at the end
(briefly).

    It ought to be pretty safe to make hypo, para, and even epi and apo
    into pre-hyphen groups tied to start-of-word.

at least epi and apo might have been left out of the
patterns because of contradictory evidence for epis-co-pal
and apos-tro-phe.  (epi-cen-ter, epi-der-mis and epis-tle
are all hyphenated correctly, as are apos-tle, but
apoc-ry[-]phal is only done halfway.)  there are quite
a few nouns of greek origin that would be hyphenated
after the initial a- if that were permitted, and the
consonants after a-po included in the second syllable.
i'm not surprised that there isn't a simple pattern.

    There are at least some consonant clusters here that could probably be
    included in the patterns.  I have tried, for instance, to think of any
    word that would be mishandled by making the "scr" grouping follow a
    hyphen after any consonant.  Perhaps there is one. In any case,
    all these words ought to be at least in the exceptions list.  At
    present-day processor speeds, a larger exceptions list should
    not be an impediment.

werner lemberg has created a script, hyphenex.sh, that
will convert the tugboat hyphenation exceptions article
into an actual exceptions list.  although this was
highlighted in tugboat 23#3/4, pp.247-248, i find that
i never posted it to ctan; i will try to do this in the
next few days, along with that version of the article.
(it will be announced via ctan-ann and comp.text.tex.)
and the list in the first message in this thread will
provide more entries for the tugboat list.

anyone finding hyphenation exceptions not mentioned in
the tugboat list is invited to send them to me for
inclusion in a future edition.

    I find it interesting that I have run into so few problems of this sort
    in ten years of professional typesetting.  But I still think that
    we might propose improvements in hyphens.tex to Don Knuth.

sorry, pierre.  that's already been proposed and rejected.
the ctan file ushyph.tex was suggested (and has been tested)
as a replacement for the original hyphen.tex, but don has
stated that the original hyphen.tex, although it could be
improved, does not constitute a bug, so is frozen.
the exception list route appears to be our best choice.

I bit of googling shows some Frank Liang with a small photo
on http://www.technopolicy.net/policy.php?content=advisory
but without email.  Another photo is of him is in
http://sts.scu.edu/globalization/Brochure.pdf, 
Try googling with `"Frank Liang" Shanghai'
 
Another Frank Liang is with Tyco ELectronics in TX, USA.

On p. 29:
"We decided to base the algorithm on our copy of Webster's _Pocket_
Dictionary, mainly because this was the only word list we had that 
included all derived forms."
and later
"..testing the algorithm against a larger dictionary
obtained from a publisher, containing about 115000 entries
produced about 10000 errors on words not in the pocket
dictionary."

As today's computer resources and fine-tuned setting
of patgen generation parameters (thresholds) allow for
having patterns generated from a wordlist with 1000000 word
forms (Czech morphology based spell checker actually knows 
5000000 word forms) with _no_ errors, short|empty exception list
and 99.9% coverage of hyphenation points,, 
the only constraint is actually having somebody 
to check such a big wordlist prehyphenated by currently
available patterns (I am willing to make the pattern generation).

There is no problem having new patterns as new \language
in addition to the standard hyphen.tex for those sacrifying
quality (together with having backward compatibility, which 
is actually lost even with adding new exceptions).

It was _very_ small wordlist, 49858 words with 88420 hyphenation points marked,
that was created from Webster's Pocket dictionary with 31036 words by

It may, but must not be safe -- checking with huge wordlist is
the safest way.

In English you are lucky to have very short words that are frequent.
And global paragraph optimization in TeX is clever/forgiving --
you did not notice that you may do better. But these cases
are rare, as adding hyphen increase the paragraph badness
(depends on the weight of \hyphenpenalty). But try to push harder
by setting higher \adjdemerits, \doublehyphendemerits and
\finalhyphendemerits.
And, do you typeset multicolumn stuff?

Changing hyphen.tex is no-go (backward compatibility), but developing 
_much better_ new American English patterns _in addition_ to hyphen.tex 
is a way to go. You can have patterns for 256 languages simultaniously
in a format file today.

As you say, the only acceptable approach is the declaration of a separate
language for fuller hyphenation than is offered by plain TeX.  "us-h-english" or
something of the sort.  

The aesthetics of more (or less) hyphenation seem potentially fascinating.
I have long had an entirely untested feeling that English setting is content
with rather more inter-word space than is preferred in some other languages.
Indeed, I often have to increase the right and left side bearings of some of
the common fonts by a very small fraction to get the effect the publisher wants.
The foundry set width can be uncomfortably tight.

I don't think I have ever seen a final hyphen in a paragraph except when doing
extreme loosening, and I am afraid I cure that the simple way, by hboxing
the final word or words (that is also the cure for isolated words shorter
than the indent when they appear at the foot of a paragraph---what some 
jargons call clubs).  

Fortunately I rarely have to indulge in multi-column setting, but I recognize
that that makes more thorough hyphenation necessary.  It really is impressive
to see how well the older high-quality news magazines did it, before most of
them fell back on tracking.  I suspect rewording was often required.  I have
had to appeal to authors, on occasion, and have always found them generous
when the problem was explained.  

As has been pointed out, even the inclusion of a larger exceptions list than
the original is going to affect Don's criterion for archival stability, so
it really looks as if the answer is a different \language. At modern 
processor speeds, as you suggest, a huge wordlist is not much of an
impediment.

There are some documents in the .../texmf/doc directory.  I don't know
which TeX distribution you're using.  teTeX and TeXlive provide a
documentation browser called texdoctk.

The best book is "The LaTeX Companion".  It describes "how do modify
the layout safely and correctly".

Robin already told you that, but I'd like to add that you should pay
attention to get the latest edition.  It has been released a few
months ago but probably some bookshops try to get rid of the old one.

You really get a lot for your money (abt 1100 pages) and it describes
exactly what you asked for.

Regards,
  Reinhard

You can do almost everything in LaTeX.  I bought the TeXbook before I
bought any book about LateX and nowadys I think that it was a wrong
decision.

Mixing up LaTeX and plain TeX causes a lot of trouble.  If you "only"
want to change the layout I'm sure that LaTeX provides everything you
need.

LaTeX macros are much more sophisticated than plain TeX macros and not
using them is wrong.

Mixing up two languages can be very painful.  I wasted a lot of time
because something like \ifx\mymacro\undefined didn't work because I
used \@ifundefined{mymacro}... before.

In other words, it is not a good idea to conviince LaTeX users to buy
the TeXbook.

  Reinhard

Or use xpdf (at least on a Linux or Unix platform) which also has a
search tool (the little pair of binoculars). If you have a Linux/Unix
platform, it probably has xpdf on it.

thanks, everyone, for your surprisingly helpful replies.

let's see if i can answer my own queestion.

I was advised that there are two sorts of .pdf files.  ones made up of
text and images, and ones made up of just images.  the text/image ones
should be easy to search through, while the image only ones will require a
converter of some sort (something stronger than ps2ascii, i've found).

next i installed acroread which seems to be just a nice little port of
adobe acrobat.  to get it i had to add



deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ unstable main

to my /etc/apt/sources.list

and poof, there it is.  thanks apt.  it comes iwth a find function right
on the little tool bar, but since my copy of my pdf seems to be of the
image only variety (I know its just a scan of a journal) i couldnt find
text.  sucks.

so now i'm back where i started, only just a bit smarter.  so what else do
y'all use to pull text out of a pdf such as this one?

thanks,

Adobe Acrobat Capture; it's a long time since I used it,
but there certainly was a time when a stripped-down
version came bundled with Acrobat itself.

If I understand you, you have an image and want text.  That requires
optical character recognition (OCR), a difficult thing.

Fortunately there is at least one open source project:

http://jocr.sourceforge.net/

It's called GOCR or JOCR.

It's still in development but might do the trick.  I'm sure they would
appreciate the attention ...

Perhaps, just perhaps, print and eye-ball or the electronic equivalent
called optical scanners which supply text outputs.  That is how many
of the electronic books at Project Gutenburg and Blaskmask are done.
If you can avail permission to make the document acceptable to these
projects (having to do with copyrights), then they just might do the
optical scanning to text for you.

Thanks for the suggestion. But this changes the meaning of my sentence since the footnote annotates the last word, not the whole sentence. Is there a better way?

Ah, hadn't appreciated that!  Maybe something like

	"blahblah\footnote{blah blah}\kern -0,5 em ."

and adjust the 0,5 em until it looks OK ?

In general, pdftotext from xpdf can be better than pdf2ps | ps2ascii.
But if the text search in xpdf or acrobat doesn't find anything, it
won't help, and OCR is your only hope.

    Fortunately there is at least one open source project:
    http://jocr.sourceforge.net/

Yep, that's a big one.  There are other.

Another one is OCRAD, which was offered to GNU, and eventually accepted:
http://www.gnu.org/software/ocrad/ocrad.html

I found these links while evaluating ocrad about a year ago, don't know
if they're still valid, but FWIW:

http://www.claraocr.org
http://lem.eui.upm.es/ocre.html
http://www.pattern-lab.de/index_e.html

I've never tried any of them personally.

Good luck,

Hello,
 
I am trying to include figures in .jpg format in my latex file. 
 
I've read that the way to do it is using the option pdftex of graphicx, but
I get this error during the compilation:
"Package graphics Warning: pdftex option does not work with standard TeX."
I've got all the files I think I need (graphicx.sty, pdftex.def), so I'm
stuck
Could you help me solve this problem?
 
Thank you!

    "Package graphics Warning: pdftex option does not work with standard TeX."

Run pdftex instead of tex.  Output will be PDF instead of DVI.

If you really want DVI output, then you have to translate the jpeg to
eps (imagemagick, netpbm, jpeg2ps, and many other utilities can do this).

Message-ID: <200408071735.i77HZmk18865@f7.net>

    the original is going to affect Don's criterion for archival
    stability, so it really looks as if the answer is a different \language.

For plain TeX, that sounds like a good idea, keeping to the spirit of
DEK's desires.  We wouldn't want him to be upset if he typesets volume 4
one day and gets different hyphenations :).

For other formats (LaTeX, ConTeXt), I don't see much harm in
changing/increasing the default English patterns.  Archival stability is
pretty much a myth, anyway -- the problems with external files (fonts,
graphics, packages, ...) changing dwarfs any hyphenation
incompatibilities.

"tex" is not actually "TeX" any more anyway (This is TeXk, ...), since
Don's criteria forbid virtually any extensions in the core.


Anyway, all this is pretty much moot without actual patterns.  Should we
write Kuiken?  He created ushyph2 and ushyphen.max years ago, but his
copyright doesn't currently allow use on TeX Live (for example).

That maybe depends on what you mean by `default English'.

I agree with all that but it may be that, even for LaTeX+Babel, there are
sound technical reasons for keeping TeX's language 0 tied to the file
hyphen.tex.

That would not prevent better hyphenation being provided by some other
`TeX-level language' which could, when it exists, become the default
for LaTeX (unless it takes so long to produce that the hegemony of
standard US English for the world's literature is a distant memory by
then ...:-).

... and of course the hyphenation bit in that core will have to change
soon(???), when it only makes sense to use fonts with `large glyph
collections'.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0408071859240.5118@llamakc>


Hi.  Is this the right place for a bibtex question?  This is a simple
one, I hope.

I'm using \bibliographystyle{apalike} becuase i like my references looking
like [Rawls 1971] in the text.  but in the reference section, the titles
of journal articles are all lower case.  But some of the titles contain
people's names, etc, so i guess they should be capitalized.  is there a
simple work around to this that i dont know about?  or can i hack my
apalike.bst?  the relevant bit seems to be here:


FUNCTION {format.title}
{ title empty$
    { "" }
    { title "t" change.case$ }
  if$
}

I admit, i think i know this stuff pretty well, until somethng doesnt work
the way i want it to.  any help?

thanks.

Enclose words that should be capitalized in braces.

@article{...,
  title = "Karl {Popper's} Theory on {Marxism}"

Then "Popper's" and "Marxism" will be left untouched, while "Theory"
will be changed according to the style.

LaTeX does not understand any graphic format.  It just leaves enough
space for the graphic and writes the filename into the DVI file.

See http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2004-June/002250.html

It's up to the DVI to PostScript converter to insert the graphic
files and convert them to PostScript.  Be aware that not every DVI to
PostScript converter can read BMP files.

PdfTeX produces the PDF file directly.  Therefore it *must* include
the graphics.

Most publishers require "camera ready copies" which means either a
PostScript or PDF file or a lot of paper.  In this case it doesn't
matter how these files are produced and nobody will complain about the
BMP files.

Some publishers (like Springer) accept LaTeX source files.  In this
case I strongly recommend to ask the publisher what he needs.  You
probably find the information on the publisher's WEB site.

If you just want to produce PostScript *and* PDF don't care about
PostScript at all and use pdfTeX.  You can convert PDF to PS quite
easily using either the Acrobat Reader (print to file) or the program
pdftops which comes with TeXLive.

Good programs for producing PDF from bitmaps are ImageMagick and
sam2p.  See

	http://www.imagemagick.org
and
	http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/sam2p

And ask your publisher ASAP what he needs.  You can save a lot of time.

  Reinhard

No, it's a bit smarter, it depends on \columnwidth.  You can try with
\usepackage{multicol}.

\hrule is a plain TeX command, in LaTeX it's better to use
\rule{\columnwidth}{0.4pt}.

Using plain TeX commands in LaTeX can lead to problems which are very
hard to locate.  Don't waste your time.

I agree with all that but it may be that, even for LaTeX+Babel, there are
sound technical reasons for keeping TeX's language 0 tied to the file
hyphen.tex.

That would not prevent better hyphenation being provided by some other
`TeX-level language' which could, when it exists, become the default
for LaTeX (unless it takes so long to produce that the hegemony of
standard US English for the world's literature is a distant memory by
then ...:-).

... and of course the hyphenation bit in that core will have to change
soon(???), when it only makes sense to use fonts with `large glyph
collections'.

LaTeX does not understand any graphic format.  It just leaves enough
space for the graphic and writes the filename into the DVI file.

See http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2004-June/002250.html

It's up to the DVI to PostScript converter to insert the graphic
files and convert them to PostScript.  Be aware that not every DVI to
PostScript converter can read BMP files.

PdfTeX produces the PDF file directly.  Therefore it *must* include
the graphics.

Most publishers require "camera ready copies" which means either a
PostScript or PDF file or a lot of paper.  In this case it doesn't
matter how these files are produced and nobody will complain about the
BMP files.

Some publishers (like Springer) accept LaTeX source files.  In this
case I strongly recommend to ask the publisher what he needs.  You
probably find the information on the publisher's WEB site.

If you just want to produce PostScript *and* PDF don't care about
PostScript at all and use pdfTeX.  You can convert PDF to PS quite
easily using either the Acrobat Reader (print to file) or the program
pdftops which comes with TeXLive.

Good programs for producing PDF from bitmaps are ImageMagick and
sam2p.  See

http://www.imagemagick.org
and
http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/sam2p

And ask your publisher ASAP what he needs.  You can save a lot of time.

  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] can't put list in picture
Message-ID: <20040810013625.GA4651@momotaro.chinmin.edu.tw>

I'm trying to produce 4 B7 forms on one B5 piece of paper using
latex. Each form is constructed as a list.

The problem is I can't use a description (or other list)
environment within a picture environment.

I need the picture environment, I believe, to get my boxes up to 1
cm from the corners of the piece of paper.

I can get text into the picture environment, but not lists.
Outside the picture environment, lists are OK, but then I can't 
position them as I like. The margins are too wide.

Here is my quizform.tex

\documentclass[b5paper]{article}
\begin{document}
\setlength{\unitlength}{1cm}
\begin{picture}(11.2,14.6)(2.5,-5.5)
\framebox(8.35,12)[tl]{
\begin{description}
\item [Round:]  \_\_\_\_\_
\item [Week:] \_\_\_\_\_
\item [Table:] \_\_\_\_\_
\item [Banker:] \_\_\_\_\_
\end{description}
}
\framebox(8.35,12)[bl]{
}
\end{picture}
\begin{picture}(11.2,14.6)(13.8,6.0)
\framebox(8.35,11.5)[bl]{
}
\framebox(8.35,11.5)[br]{
}
\end{picture}
\end{document}

And here is the error message:

greg@momotaro ~/cw

?

Whether the description environment is in a framebox or not,
I get the same error.

When I move it out of the picture environment, it produces a
dvi file, but not the dvi file I want.

This is the Fedora Core 1 rpm of tetex-latex. 

Do I need to investigate other packages?

Message-ID: <000001c47e8c$2d559080$0402a8c0@DARKLUGIA>

 

Hello:

 

As a TeX user back in the late 1980s, I had an article published in the
TUGBoat issue 11(2), June 1990. The title is Easy Table (page 250). This
is a macro package to typeset simple to complex tabular works that
commercial typesetters do. I did not promote this useful macro package
and also haven't used TeX over the years. But recently, I have talked to
a number of people who have used some of the TeX table packages, as well
as other commercial non-TeX softwares to typeset tables, and many of
these users would like to see Easy Table introduced to the TeX
community. This is after they have used the Easy Table macro package and
found out how flexible and versatile it can do for the professional
tabular work, i.e., meeting the most rigid requirements from the
commercial publishing industry.

 

I would like to know if it is possible to re-publish this article in a
near future TUGBoat issue, and what is the cost of a full-page
advertising for this macro package (for one-time ad and full-year ad).

 

Thank you!

 

Khanh Ha

Hi, 

 

I recently upgraded my computer and installed a newer distribution of
MikTex. In the past, with an older distribution of MiKTeX, I was able to
convert eps figures to pdf using epstopdf and never had problem. In fact, my
computer at work still has the older MiKTeX and it works fine. However, at
home, with the newer distribution, every time I attempt to convert an eps
file to pdf I get the message

 

Error: cannot go back to line '%%BoundingBox

 

Has anyone been able to solve this problem? I usually create the eps figure
with MATLAB, again it works fine with the previous MiKTeX.

 

Best,

 

Jorge

I'm sure you're not ignorant, but your explanation is distincly unclear!
However, let's work backwards :

 > so that \c{cat,mouse} should give the result 'cat,dog'.

i.e.,

	\def \c #1, #2{#1,<something>}

where we don't yet know how <something> becomes instantiated to "dog".

Can you explain this part ?

For what it's worth (and not knowing what exactly you're setting out
to achieve) you /may/ need to look at \expandafter : in your example
above :

 > \edef\c#1,#2{\b{\a#1,#2}}, but it didn't work.

there is every chance that you need to force a to be expanded before b,
in which case you would need something like :

	\edef \c #1,#2{ \expandafter  \expandafter  \expandafter \b \expandafter {\a #1,#2}}

I'll try to be more precise.
I use plain TeX, with eplain macros for cross references.
Suppose I say

\definexref{label}{mouse, cat, }{}

and, some lines below,

\refn{label}

. This expands to:

mouse, cat,

. Now, if I define

\edef\a#1{Hallo, #1!}

and then I say

\a{\refn{label}}

, I get

Hallo, mouse, cat, !

Right. But if I define instead

\edef\b#1, #2, {Hallo, #1, #2, !}

and then I say

\b{\refn{label}}

I get an error message:

! Paragraph ended before \b was complete.

I'd need to know a correct way to "put \refn into \b"
so to obtain the same expansion I get putting \refn into \a with
"\a{\refn{label}}".
The idea is that \b should collect the expansion of \refn{label}
and go ahead with its own expansion:
the value assumed by the one-argument function \refn
should be argument for the two-argument function \b. I also tried with:
\edef\c#1{\expandafter\b{\refn{#1}}}

and then I said

\c{label}

but still got an error message:

! Argument of \b has an extra }.


Any help will be highly appreciated.

1. When I enter math mode in multicols a lot of space is
    inserted before the first paragraph inside multicols
    giving me

                          eqn2 (tag2)         eqn4 (tag4)
     eqn1   (tag1)        eqn3 (tag3)         eqn5 (tag5)

2. I typically have a bunch of equations of various with,
    and want them to take as little space as possible by
    putting them on multiple columns (the equations are
    inference rules etc). Preferrably, I would like an
    environment that decides for me when to break the
    equations to several columns and where to break them,
    e.g. giving me

          equation_0_is_terribly_terribly_length (tag0)
      eqn1   (tag1)        eqn2 (tag2)         eqn3 (tag3)
      equation_4_is_medium (tag4)  equation_5_is_medium (tag4)

Does anyone have a solution or suggestion?

You are suplying only this one argument to a macro that takes two which
are separated by a comma and followed by one.  Therefore:

If you are using \edef, you shold try

	\edef\c#1{\noexpand\b \refn{#1}}

Also

	\expandafter\b \refn{label}

should work, as well.

If you are using Plain TeX, you may find _The TeX Book_ useful.

Dear Rudolfo,

The reference for the discussion that follows is Chapter 20 of
the TeXbook by Donald Knuth, which is well worth studying
carefully.

You asked why in Plain TeX the code

	\edef\a#1,#2{#1}
	\edef\b#1{#1,dog}
	\edef\c#1,#2{\b{\a#1,#2}}
	\c{cat,mouse}
	\bye

did not give the desired result, namely: cat,dog.  If you run
this code you get the response:

	Runaway argument?
	{cat,mouse} 
	! Forbidden control sequence found while scanning use of \c.
	<inserted text> 
	                \par 
	<to be read again> 
	                   \bye 
	l.5 \bye

This is actually a good clue to the problem.  It says that the 
usage of \c did not match its definition.  In your case, you have 
defined \c to have two arguments, separated by a comma.  However 
an argument in TeX always has properly nested braces, so in your 
usage the text {cat,mouse} is being absorbed into the first 
argument and while TeX was searching after that for a comma it 
found \bye! 

This suggests trying

	\edef\a#1,#2{#1}
	\edef\b#1{#1,dog}
	\edef\c#1,#2{\b{\a#1,#2}}
	\c cat,{mouse}
	\bye

The space after \c serves to separate the control sequence from 
the argument but will otherwise be ignored.  The braces around 
mouse are needed since otherwise only the "m" will be taken as 
the second argument.  After the correct argument is determined, 
TeX will strip off the braces.  (Braces are not needed around cat 
since the first argument is delimited by the comma.) 

Unfortunately the result of this code is: cat2,dog.  What is
going on?  You have chosen to use \edef, expanded definition. 
This means that even before the macro \c gets used, the macros
present in its replacement text will get expanded.  In
particular, the text \a#1,#2 will be expanded.  The first
argument to \a will be the text #1 (since it is delimited by the
comma) and the second argument to \a will be the character #. 
That means there will be an extraneous 2 left over which appears
in the final output.

"How does TeX determine where an argument stops, you ask".  The 
answer (which has been used many times in the above discussion) 
is in the double dangerous bend paragraph at the bottom of p.  
203 in the TeXbook. 

Another problem with the above code is that you wanted the form 
of the input to be \c{cat,mouse}, instead of using the odd 
looking \c cat,{mouse}.  This means that \c should defined to 
only have one argument, namely the full string cat,mouse and the 
parsing of the two words separated by a comma could be left to 
another macro.  But this seems to imply that you can't use \edef 
for \c. 

At this point there are many solutions, depending on what you 
need.  Here is one:

	\def\a#1,#2,{#1}
	\def\b#1{#1,dog}
	\def\c#1{\b{\a#1,}}
	\c{cat,mouse}
	\bye

The argument to \c will be cat,mouse (with the braces stripped as 
noted above).  To avoid have just m taken as the second argument 
to \a, I have inserted another comma in the definition of \c 
after \a#1 and I have have modified \a to look for two arguments, 
each delimited by a comma. 

I hope this helps.

- Les

The following is really ugly, but does what I think you're after. I'm
sure you could turn this into something prettier by defining a macro so
you only needed to type in each equation once. Also the display maths
doesn't seem to take up quite as much space as the equation environment,
so I had to fiddle with the dummy equation number to get \eqwidth to be
big enough to avoid the equation number ending up on its own line.

Hope this helps. Be sure not to leave any blank lines or you'll get the
minipages as separate paragraphs!

Hello

Thanks. I tried to improve the code, but I am unable to use the \tag  
outside a gather-environment (see code below, removing #2 fails if  
\tag{..} is in #1 instead). Also I have to tweak math mode for some  
obscure reason - I have to use ensuremath before invoking the command.

My main idea is to have this:

\begin{multieqn}
x^2+x = 1                  \tag{$\alpha$}     \\
\dfrac{x^3+x^2}{e^x} = 2   \tag{2nd one}      \\
...
\end{multieqn}

Is there a way of reusing the //-separators to insert an occurrence of  
my \multieqn on every separate line here?

Med v?nliga h?lsningar / Yours Sincerely,
Johan Glimming

I tried both the alternatives you suggested, 
and in both cases got the error message:
! Paragraph ended before \b was complete.

A similar problem arises if I say:

\definexref{label}{1}{}

and, some lines below, 
I try to compare the result of \refn{label}, which is the number 1,
with a number, say 2, using \ifnum. There are troubles: if I say, e.g.,

\ifnum2=\refn{label2}yes\else no\fi

I get the error message

! Missing number, treated as zero.

I'd need to compare the result of \refn{label} with a number.
Is there a way to achieve this purpose?

Fine, for this you will need \csname ... \endcsname :

\def \definexref #1#2{\expandafter \def \csname label:#1\endcsname {#2}}

     and

\def \refn #1{\csname label:#1\endcsname}

Of course : your parameter structure for \b requires two distinct parameters,
the first separated by a comma and a space from the second, which is itself
terminated by a comma and a space.

Then \b must expect a single parameter, not two

Yes, your \expandafter is causing the open brace following \b
to be expanded; it can't expand, but \expandafter won't look ahead
until it finds something it /can/ expand.

Message-ID: <6.0.2.0.1.20040812102821.01f3be30@extinctionshift.com>

Dear William Adams:



I have jpg, Tif and gif files of images that I want to convert to EPS files 
of images.

I am using PCTeX, a windows version.  I have Professional Window XP.  I use 
"includegraphics" and EPS graphics files.  Attached is a sample of my EPS 
graphic files.


My Question:

1) How do I generate the EPS files that will display (show up) in my LaTeX 
document, when the dvi or output file is generated "WITHOUT THE BOX"?
   In other words, I need the images to show WITHOUT the surrounding BOX?

  Note: In publications, math and Physics journals, the graphics and 
illustrations generally don't have the inclusing BOX arround them. (I know 
the BoundingBox is needed for sizing the eps file, but don't have to print it).


2) What TOOL(s) do I need, besides what I already have, to do that job?


3) What's the best tool(s) for converting the  jpg, Tif and gif files to 
EPS files.


Thank you for your support.

1.In the book documentstyle, is there a way (similar to the 
\author[shortname]{authorname} format in amsarticle) to create an 
alternative version of a section header (shorter than the actual 
section title)? I have a section title which I want to keep, but which 
in the header (right page?) runs into the page number.

2. Is there a way of getting fonts similar to the euler script fonts to 
use locally, in text mode?
I am trying to have some statements headed "Thou shalt not", with the 
heading in a "biblical" font, to use via a macro.  I can't use the 
euscript or eufrak packages, as they affect the global form of math 
displays, which I don't want to do---and besides, their fonts only work 
in math mode.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Please note that I am not 
someone who knows how to do any meta stuff:  I'm pretty good at making 
environments and macros with arguments, though.

Probably almost all the same answer: Ghostscript with the GSview front-end for
Windows: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html

You'll also need dvips (some version) to convert .dvi to .ps files, for which
GSview can act as a full previewer with autoreload etc. If your (La)TeX
installation is a more-or-less standard (TDS compliant etc.) one, it's
probably already on your machine. A good TeX-editor/front-end should let you
configure the automatic use of these apps so as to achieve a transparent
edit-compile-preview cycle for your convenience.

Subject: [texhax] A problem about \jobname
Message-ID: <MBBBJFILCHONLINKEBBKGEFGCDAA.romeomedina@libero.it>

Hi, all.

Suppose I'm editing 'myfile.tex'. If I say

\newtoks\filename
\filename={myfile}
\edef\tempa{\the\filename}
\edef\tempb{\jobname}
\ifx\tempa\tempb yes\else no\fi

I get 'no', whereas I would expect 'yes'. Instead, I get 'yes' if I say

\newtoks\filename
\filename={myfile}
\edef\tempa{\the\filename}
\edef\tempb{myfile}
\ifx\tempa\tempb yes\else no\fi

. Can anybody explain why I get 'no' in the first case 
and, above all, suggest a suitable code 
in order to correctly test if the value of \jobname, which is 'myfile',
is equal to the file name, which is 'myfile' as well,
such obtaining a 'yes'?

Thanks to anyone who will reply,
					Rodolfo

The items don't match by their catcodes. The \jobname consists of
catcode 12 (other) characters, whereas the filename has catcode 11
(letter) chars. Take e. g. \meaning or \string to align the catcodes of
the two items:

\newtoks\filename
\filename={myfile}

\edef\tempa{\the\filename}
\edef\tempb{\jobname}

---\tempa---\tempb---

\edef\tempa{\meaning\tempa}
\edef\tempb{\meaning\tempb}

---\tempa---\tempb---

\ifx\tempa\tempb yes\else no\fi

\hrule

\edef\tempc{\expandafter\string\csname \the\filename\endcsname}
\edef\tempd{\expandafter\string\csname \jobname\endcsname}

---\tempc---\tempd---

\ifx\tempc\tempd yes\else no\fi

\bye

Thanks indeed for your suggestions, which worked perfectly both of them.
I should study carefully commands like
\csname... \endcsname, \expandafter, \string, \meaning and others:
I tried to, but found them quite hard to understand.

The problem you helped me with, though,
was just the first step of a final problem I want to work out in the end,
which is using the above \ifx... \else... \fi condition
with the eplain commands \refn{} and \definexref{}{}{} for cross references.
My final purpose is to say first:
\definexref{label}{\jobname}{}

and then achieve something like (trying to applying your indications):

\edef\tempa#1{\refn{#1}}
\edef\tempb{\jobname}

\edef\tempa#1{\meaning\tempa{#1}}
\edef\tempb{\meaning\tempb}

\ifx\tempa{label}\tempb yes\else no\fi

and get 'yes'. I get 'no' instead. I also tried with

\edef\tempc#1{\expandafter\string\csname pippo:#1\endcsname\refn{#1}}
\edef\tempd#1{\csname pippo:#1\endcsname}
\edef\tempe{\expandafter\string\csname \jobname\endcsname}

\ifx\tempd{label}\tempe yes\else no\fi

getting 'no' as well.

Is there a way to achieve this? Could you help me in this final step?

Thanks indeed,
		Rodolfo

You can always check the weird contents of definitions by \meaning... or
\tracingmacros.

I don't know what you want to achieve but maybe this hack keeps you
going...

\input eplain
\def\fileword{file}
\definexref{label}{myfile}{file}

\def\xrefn#1{%
\edef\tempa{\refn{#1}}\edef\tempa{\meaning\tempa}}

\xrefn{label}
\edef\tempb{\jobname}\edef\tempb{\meaning\tempb}

See \ifx\tempa\tempb this file\else \ref{label}\fi.
\bye

The problem seems to be solved now.

An analogous problem arises when you try to `treat \refn as a number',
i. e. to compare the result of \refn{label} with a number.
Example: if you say:

 \definexref{label}{1}{}

and, some lines below, you try to compare the result of \refn{label},
which is the number 1,
with a number, say 2, using \ifnum, you have troubles: if I say, e.g.,

 \ifnum2=\refn{label2}yes\else no\fi

you get the error message

 ! Missing number, treated as zero.

The reason why you get that `Missing number, treated as zero' message
is that on the very first run of TeX on your input file,
when no .aux file is present yet,
\refn cannot know what the definition of your label is,
therefore it defines your label to a string (`label', in typewriter face).
So when you try to compare this definition with a number,
TeX gets a back-quote where it expects a number, hence the error message.
Note that when you run TeX next time,
after definition for the label has been written out to the .aux file,
the label will get correct definition and will expand to a number,
and you won't get the error message.

The solution to this problem was suggested by Oleg Katsitadze,
in the tex-eplain eplain mailing list.
It boils down to checking whether \refn{label} expands to a number,
and doing the comparison only when the label does expand to a number.
Here is the hack:

  \def\gobbleminus#1{\ifx-#1\else#1\fi}
  \def\IsInteger#1{%
    TT\fi
    \ifcat_\ifnum9<1\gobbleminus#1 _\else A\fi
  }                %this definition looks deeply misterious to me!
                   %what on earth will ever mean that `TT\fi'??
                   %and `\ifnum9<1'?

, which must be used as

  \if\IsInteger{<subject of test>}%
    <deal with integer>%
  \else
    <deal with non-integer>%
  \fi

. \IsInteger macro has a flaw, as \IsInteger{ {<integer>}} will hold true,
disregarding the braces and/or leading spaces,
but for our purpose this is good enough.

Now comparing the result of \refn{label} with a number would look like the
following:

  \definexref{label}{1}{}

  \edef\temp{\refn{label}}
  \if\IsInteger{\temp}%
    \ifnum2=\refn{label}yes\else no\fi
  \else
    <no .aux file present yet>%
  \fi

Once again, this will not work
if it's possible for the label to get defined as {<integer>}.
In that case you'll need to write a better \IsInteger macro.

Thanks to all,
        	Rodolfo

Subject: [texhax] problem with INBOOK in bibtex
Message-ID: <411F9C0E.1000207@binghamton.edu>

I'm running MikTeX on Win98.

I have a citation in a paper that is not coming out in the bibliography 
section the way I'd like it.

Here is my preamble:
   \documentclass[12pt, USletter]{report}
   \usepackage[super]{natbib}
   \bibliographystyle{unsrt}
   \bibpunct{}{}{,}{}{}{}
   \usepackage{fullpage}
   \usepackage{setspace}
   \usepackage{graphicx}
%\doublespacing


I use both TextPad and JabRef to manage my file of references.  Here is 
the bibtex source code of the citation involved.  It was generated when 
I entered the item into the database using JabRef bibtex manager:

@INBOOK{Conte1997,
   chapter = {Self-report measures of psychological mindedness},
   pages = {1-26},
   title = {Psychological Mindedness: a Contemporary Understanding},
   publisher = {Lawrence Erlbaum},
   year = {1997},
   editor = {M McCallum and WE Piper},
   author = {HR Conte and RR Ratto},
   address = {Mahwah, NJ},
   owner = {Christopher W. Ryan},
}

Here is the warning generated by bibtex8:

The 8-bit codepage and sorting file: 88591lat.csf
The top-level auxiliary file: registrar_07-01-2004.aux
The style file: unsrt.bst
Database file #1: references.bib
Warning--can't use both author and editor fields in Conte1997
(There was 1 warning)

Tool completed with exit code 1


And, here is how the output appears in my paper:

HR Conte and RR Ratto.  Psychological Mindedness:  a Contemporary 
Understanding, chapter Self-report measures of psychological mindedness, 
pages 1-26.  Lawrence Erlbaum, Mahway, NJ, 1997.

[I can't convey it in e-mail, but the five words between and including 
"Psychological" and "Understanding" are italicized.]



I don't think that's the way this was suppposed to turn out.  I would 
rather have it look something like this:

HR Conte and RR Ratto.  Self-report measures of psychological 
mindedness.  In M McCallum and WE Piper, eds. Psychological Mindedness: 
  a Contemporary Understanding.   Pages 1-26.  Lawrence Erlbaum, Mahway, 
NJ, 1997.  [also with those same 5 words italicized]

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <2004-08-15T2026130200@linxi.fqdn.th-h.de>

Hi,

should the size of the parentheses/brackets for intervals/functions be
adjusted? 

Like: 

the interval $(\frac{x}{5}, \frac{x}{3})$,
the function $f(x^{\frac{\pi}{2}})$

or

the interval $\left(\frac{x}{5}, \frac{x}{3}\right)$,
the function $f\left(x^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right)$


Is there any book on math typography, which discusses that?

Best regards,
P.

Message-ID: <412011F5.5040205@cdmnet.org>

Following the recent thread on hyphenation, one of my users is asking 
about the converse issue: whereby TeX (LaTeX c.f. teTeX in this case) is 
hyphenating words he believes it shouldn't.

Appended is an example list of words he has to override. Is my friend 
being too picky, or does he have a misconfiguration somewhere (which 
would undoubtedly be my fault; or perhaps his own settings, also appended).

All comment gratefully appreciated.

Hi,

No, because in running text, fractions should be set with a slash, like

the interval $(x/5, x/3)$

The "stacked" fractions disturb the rhythm of the paragraph, and if set so
small that they wouldn't, they are unreadable.

    Following the recent thread on hyphenation, one of my users is asking
    about the converse issue: whereby TeX (LaTeX c.f. teTeX in this case) is
    hyphenating words he believes it shouldn't.

    Appended is an example list of words he has to override. Is my friend
    being too picky, or does he have a misconfiguration somewhere (which
    would undoubtedly be my fault; or perhaps his own settings, also appended).

    [...]

    \hyphenation{local}
    \hyphenation{together}
    \hyphenation{climates}
    \hyphenation{really}
    \hyphenation{appear}
    \hyphenation{issue}
    \hyphenation{Everett}
    \hyphenation{measure}
    \hyphenation{family}
    \hyphenation{applied}
    \hyphenation{senior}
    \hyphenation{autumn}
    \hyphenation{remained}

    \hyphenation{actions}
    \hyphenation{effort}
    \hyphenation{final}
    \hyphenation{either}
    \hyphenation{simple}
    \hyphenation{carried}
    \hyphenation{science}
    \hyphenation{legal}
    \hyphenation{worthy}

while tex does, on occasion, hyphenate words it
shouldn't, or put hyphens in the wrong places,
the words in the list shown are words that could
legitimately be hyphenated in u.s. english; a cursory
check of webster's collegiate dictionary (not the most
recent edition) shows hyphenation points at the same
places shown by a quick \showhyphens run.

even "really", which i see as the most questionable
of the list, has hyphenation points "re-al-ly" (the
second hyphen would be prevented by the setting of
\righthyphenmin=3).

your client can reset \lefthyphenmin=3 to avoid all
hyphens after fewer than three initial letters, but
for the rest of these words, the only solutions are
 - try the uk hyphenation patterns and settings,
   which are different from the u.s. ones;
 - use \hyphenation{...} as s/he has done.

I am never sure of the answer to this : is it valid/correct
to set \{left|right}hyphenmin in the TeX file to a value
other than that set when using PatGen ?

    to set \{left|right}hyphenmin in the TeX file to a value
    other than that set when using PatGen ?

i believe that there are valid reasons to do so.
knuth didn't introduce \[left|right]hyphenmin until
version 3, when it became obvious that patterns other
than the ones for english were needed and used.  in
a document with multilingual inclusions it might be
desirable to use a non-patgen value for the inclusions
even when using the appropriate patterns for them.

and setting the \...hyphenmin's to "infinity" may be
a more efficient way to suppress hyphenation altogether
than setting the \...hyphenpenalty values.

You can always check the weird contents of definitions by \meaning... or

Maybe the LaTeX package "nicefrac" is interesting in this respect.

I don't think so: I haven't used that particular package, but the name
"nicefrac" suggests that it typesets those
superscript-numerator/slash/subscript-denominator fractions, which I have
only seen in cookbooks and elementary school math books. If the document
does not belong to one of these categories, you should probably refrain from
using it.

Paul

Dudes,

this ist not the Question!!! The Question is: should the size of the
parentheses/brackets/braces be adjusted in case of intervals or
functions. *Regardless* inline or display.

AFAIR in Jim Hefferons algebra book, the size of the interval
parentheses is *not* adjusted.  One reason, may be, is not to confuse
the interval parenteses with the "normal" multiply parenthes. Who
knows. Math typography is a (undocumented) mystery.

Best regards,
P.

PS: nicefrac sucks. It uses the virgule instead of the solidus. This
may be OK for CM, where the solidus also sucks (compare with the
fraction bar in the percent sign), but for the rest of the fonts it is
simply wrong.

I checked a few UK hyphenation dictionaries and only a few give a
`preferred' division point in a few of these words (but different ones).

Between them they list quite a few `undesirable' points, especially if
a lonely two letters at the start of a word are allowed (an activity
generally deprecated).

My own taste does not agree with any of my sources but would certainly not
add many tolerble division points in this list (except where other
possibiliies do not exist).

So, it's each to his own around here, as ever.

chris,
you have confirmed my hypothesis that in the u.k.
the hyphenation criteria are stricter than, as well
as different from those in the u.s.  thus the u.k.
patterns would probably eliminate most of the hyphens
from words in this list.

you are correct that the file hyphen.tex is responsible;
tex is merely following the patterns given there.
thanks for trying to keep me honest.

It's doubly unfortunate that teTeX has just had to remove ukhyphen.tex 
owing to licencsing issues (although I believe there are hopes this 
might be sorted soon).

I was able to do this, thanks to help off-list.

What I did was put frameboxes in 4 pictures smaller than the
frameboxes themselves and then put minipages in the frameboxes.
This prevented latex spacing the forms out onto 2 sheets of paper.

\newcommand{\myform}[1]{%
\setlength{\unitlength}{1cm}
\begin{picture}(5,7)#1
                \framebox(8.5,12)[t]{
                \begin{minipage}{8.0cm}
		...


This was actually in a \newcommand. I ran the new command
with different points of origin.
 
Like this:

\myform{(+2.6,+2.0)}
\myform{(+0.1,+2.0)}
\myform{(+14.6,+14.0)}
\myform{(-5.9,+7.0)}

I get warnings about underfull and overfull \hboxes, but it prints
well. Incidentally, from a2ps, I also get the message:

[quizform.dvi (dvi, delegated to dvips): 1 page on 1 sheet]

This suggests there is the possibility of printing more than one
page on one sheet, and that there might be a cleaner solution to 
my problem.

This opinion is shared by Morten H\o gholm, who has written xfrac
which claims to have solved your objections.

Which is why I wrote the xfrac package. It is still in an experimental  
state (and requires experimental LaTeX packages and eTeX extensions). Find

It is desirable to have hyphenmin registers set to one
during the patgen generation (and have hyphenation points
marked even so close to border). It makes easier generalization
for patgen, and leads to the smaller patterns, especially
in `syllable-based' hyphenation languages.

Well, I think this IS the question (at least to a certain extent), because I
would prefer "x/3" over "\frac{x}{3}" even in displayed math. For something
more complicated, for which a "real" fraction would be more desireable, I
think parenthesis/brackets/braces with adjusted size look better. Why should
there be a reason to have "multiply"-parenthesis grow, but interval
parenthesis or argument parenthesis stay at the same size? I know math books
that have all parenthesis at the same size, sometimes even the "multiply"
ones, but I contribute that to bad typesetting software...

Confusion between interval and multiply parenthesis can be avoided by using
"real" (i.e. round) parenthesis to group terms and for function arguments,
brackets for intervals, and braces for sets. Two levels of term grouping can
be managed by parenthesis of different size, and not by applying parenthesis
for the inner level and brackets for the outer.

(Just my two cents.)

Message-ID: <2D5CE74F-F102-11D8-9C0B-000393BC23DC@math.ufl.edu>

I was trying to change my font-set, using packages like palatino, 
pamath, mathpazo. etc,  but each of them ruined my pictures.

The pictures are programmed directly in LaTeX and use various line 
thicknesses through \linethickness implemented via the package curves.

The effect of changing fonts was, in particular, losing the (important 
for me) thickness of 1.5pt, which now appeared to yield results of 2pt. 
  I am assuming that the pictures use some character that is changed by 
the fonts packages.

Thanks,

Subject: [texhax] Labelling inline equations in LaTeX
Message-ID: <NGBBLHCDALFCOGPKMFFJAEHKDBAA.wlanger@bigpond.net.au>






Hi there all, 

I was wondering what the "obvious" way is to label a mathematical equation
that is "inline", that is, it is within a paragraph of text, and not
seperated out with it's own indentation and so on.

When I try to do this, LateX puts the equation in a paragraph of its own,
which is not what I want.

Could anyone direct me to some sample code showing how to do this?

Thanks very much, 

Wendy Langer

Surely one sets \pretolerance to infinity if one wants to
suppress hyphenation?

Hello,

I'm not a member of this list but someone forwarded the cited note to me, 
so I hope folks don't mind a comment and I apologize if I miss any replies.

  Plamen Tanovski:
    The Question is: should the size of the
    parentheses/brackets/braces be adjusted in case of intervals or
    functions. *Regardless* inline or display.

    AFAIR in Jim Hefferons algebra book, the size of the interval
    parentheses is *not* adjusted.  One reason, may be, is not to confuse
    the interval parenteses with the "normal" multiply parenthes. Who
    knows. Math typography is a (undocumented) mystery.

I do it just as you've said, to prevent confusion (although I can't
remember using it in my LA).  I'd think that the interval from 2/3 to 
7 shown as: 

   -
  |   2
  |   -
  |   3  .. 7 )
   -

would be bad, and a matching large one would also be bad.  To my mind, 
the interval is set in regular type (even in display), just as sometimes 
I might have "where $x>p$" at the end of a display line.

But I'm no authority.  And my edition of Swanson's _Mathematics Into Type_
doesn't seem to say.  In that case, I usually look at a couple of books 
whose typography looks good to me and try to mimic what I see there.  Did 
you look through a half-dozen reputable books (not mine!)?  The AMS
materials seem to me to ba authoritative, and Springer, Elsevier, etc.

Hi Tom,

had the same problem, resolved it by telling ghostscript that I'm using A4
paper (some ghostscript installations default to legal paper format). 

Command line is 

   gs -sPAPERSIZE=A4

if I remember correctly, but to be sure please look it up in the
gs-documentation.

	Betreff: [texhax] Hello - I have a problem
	
	

	Hi 
	
	I have a problem with producing pdf files - please read on... 
	
	Initially I thought the problem was related to WinEdt so I contacted
them: 
	
	I love your program - it is great. I have a minor problem though: 
	
	I have noticed differences between pdf files it generates - if I go
straight from dvips -> pdf the document looks as it should. If however I go
from dvips -> ps, then from ps -> pdf the document is slightly trimmed, i.e.
the upper margin is much reduced.  Okay - you may say - don't do the latter.
Fair enough, however I have found pdfs created in the first way are often
unstable when e-mailed and won't open at the other end. I don't know why
this should be so as they apparently work fine before being sent. This means
I am compelled to use the first method and end up sending trimmed pdf files
that look odd.
	
	Can you help? 
	
	Many Regards 
	
	Tom 
	
	Response for WinEdt team: 
	
	Actually, WinEdt has nothing to do with this (just an ascii text
editor that offers an interface to your TeX system) and all to do with the
TeX system. The documentation, eg C:\TeX\MiKTeX\doc\miktex\samples or 
	texmf\doc\latex\graphics\epslatex.ps  likely offer the appropriate
advise. Alternative, I reckon the FAQs at the TeX site (www.tug.or) would
help. 
	
	I have tried the FAQ however I could not find anything that helped. 
	
	Do you have any advice? It would be much appreciated.

    Surely one sets \pretolerance to infinity if one wants to
    suppress hyphenation?

well, that's one way of doing it, but it results
in more passes through the text.  doesn't make
much difference with the speed of computers these
days, but even just a few years ago, it really did.

Thanks a lot for that.

I've looked at the TOC of that book, but the math typography seems not
to be the main topic there.

I doubt that in the big commerce Springevier is place for any thoughts
about math typography.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0408181617490.7125-100000@pcct700.ct.infn.it>

Dear Latex and FeynMF users,

my question is: "How can I make sure that a recipient will be able to 
format my preprint that uses feynMF?"

This question is answered in Part 3 of Thorsten Ohl's tutorial on No. 222
of CERN Newsletter, (dtill available from the author's present webpage, 
http://theorie.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~ohl ).

There, it is suggested that Metapost is used, and that feynmp.sty be
included in the submission of the preprint, along with all the single
postscript files for each diagram.

This is what I did, then, but due to some "dull" uploading form, which 
nowadays automatize the submission of papers to several scientific 
journals, I still had some problems.

My figure is composed of several diagrams, linked by mathematical
operators (summations etc), and bearing labels. The figure then requires
standard fonts, but perhaps at the resolution etc specified on my "local" 
system/computer.

I then decided to isolate the page containing my figure, and make a
postscript file (dvips) out of it.

I tried to include that postscript file into my preprint
(\includegraphics[bb=...,clip]{}). No problem on my computer, but there
were again problems on the recipient's one. The remote dvips complained
about missing fonts when including the figure. That's typical, and its
reason is indeed explained in Ohl's Tutorial.

For the time being, I eventually decided to display the single postscript 
page with Gimp, and cut and paste the region I was interested in into 
another, rasterized postscript file.

Of course, this worked remotely, but the output (resolution etc) is 
definitely ugly, and is certainly not in the spirit of FeynMF, i.e. that 
of producing really beautiful Feynman diagrams.

I hope I'll be able to submit a better quality figure later (on proof or 
resubmission).

Any suggestion on how to produce a better quality, even if still
rasterized, font-independent postscript file out of a single postscript
page generated by dvips? (Or out of a single PDF page generated by
dvipdfm?)

Thanks in advance for all your suggestions.

Best regards,

Giuseppe.

	[SNIP}

	Whereas it is possible that some ghostscript installations default
	to legal size paper (8.5inx14in-216mmx356mmi-612ptx1008pt), it is
	more probable that they default to letter size paper (8.5inx11in-
	216mmx279mm-612ptx792pt), which is close to A4 (8.28inx11.7in-
	210mmx297mm-596ptx843pt).

	Now, if were possible to convince the Europeans to stop hard-
	coding paper sizes into software instead of putting such data
	into configuration files so that it would be easier to adjust
	their software to work with letter paper, the European software
	would be much more popular with United States users.

I'm preparing a LaTeX document which involves per-page numbering.  In
other words, I need "1a" "1b" etc on p1, "2a" "2b" etc on p2, and so on.

Thanks to David Kastrup's excellent perpage.sty, I am able to handle
what I thought was the difficult part, the "a", "b" part of the
numbering scheme.  However, I'm struggling to get the page number to
come out right: in particular, \thepage can give a value that is one too
small at the top of a page -- presumably because of the way TeX "cuts
the scroll".  Does anyone have a solution to this, perhaps a variation
on perpage.sty that increments rather than resets a counter?  I'm afraid
the wizardry in perpage.sty is beyond me these days...

Many thanks in advance.

You have to stick a label down and use \pageref if you want that to
come out right.  \thepage will always be occasionally wrong in the way
you describe.

If you can switch to using the memoir class, its 
``\strictpagechecktrue'' command will sort out most such instances --- 
in some places though one must add a ``\parnopar'' to force a paragraph 
to break (without changing its appearance) at a page boundary.

Alternately, one can write out the page number and read it back in 
after a second run.

Or, perhaps you should look at adapting the ``footmisc'' code which has 
a per-page option for numbering footnotes....

Why are you complaining, it defaults to letter not A4. I'm the one that should 
be complaining, since I have A4 paper exclusively.

I'm sure this would be far simpler that convincing your fellow
Americans to use sensible paper sizes such as the ISO A/B/C [1]
series ...

     "Globalization starts with getting the details right.
      Inconsistent use of SI units and international
      standard paper sizes remain today a primary
      cause for U.S. businesses failing to meet
      the expectations of the global economy."

you needn't feel embarrassed about that...

or use a label, as someone else has suggested.  they'll multiply
themselves, of course.

footmisc's code is pretty simple-minded, by comparison with
perpage.sty; it certainly deals explicitly in page numbers as well as
things running per page, so it might be practicable to hack it...

It is worth pointing out that not all authorities agree on the putative
difference in definition of "virgule" and "solidus": many regard them as
synonyms, despite recent attempts by particular authors to give them
different, specific, technical meanings. These technical meanings are
not yet universal. It's therefore always worth specifying precisely what
you mean when you're talking about them if you want everybody to
understand the distinction!

I disagree: 1/2 as set by say the nicefrac or xfrac packages is
excellent when used in the right circumstances. A good example is for
"square root" when used as a power; neither of the alternatives look
good.

	On the same basis as you deny me the privilege to complain
	about a metric basis of European software.  And, my complaint
	was not about the metric basis itself; but, rather, the
	inability to rapidly and easily adjust to standard United
	States paper sizes (which may remain even if they become
	measured in metric units directly: e.g., 216mmx279mm).

	ghostscript defaults to letter paper because it is supported
	at the University of Wisconsin, United States of America, amd
	probably was written in the here as well.

	TeX and LaTeX as of late even though they were written in the
	United States and a2ps  are examples of the opposite and it is
	quite annoying to spend a day locating the points in their
	configuration files that need to be adjusted.  There are
	other products that I have given up on that I was requested
	to assist in the product's support because we could not
	locate the points in the code where the A4 assumptions
	were located.  That is what I was complaining about.

	Yes, I agree it would be far simplier to convince the
	Europeans to make their software capable and flexible
	than to force a major portion of the world's economy to
	immediately switch to using ISO standard, but not sensible,
	paper sizes.  It also would take considerably less effort:

	by making the equipment capable of handling either set of
	paper sizes). When almost all such equipment can handle
	either set of paper sizes would be the time to do such a
	switch.  The only significant advantage to the ISO sizes
	is that cutting sheets parallel to the short sides results
	in the next smaller sheet size.

	The author also states: ``This information was gathered

	It is apparent to me that the author has a strong

Subject: [texhax] Re: embedding Feynman graphs in preprints
Message-ID: <200408181856.i7IIut726159@f7.net>

    Any suggestion on how to produce a better quality, even if still
    rasterized, font-independent postscript file out of a single postscript
    page generated by dvips? (Or out of a single PDF page generated by
    dvipdfm?)

I am not familiar with feynMF, but some general ideas that come to mind:

1) make PDF files out of the figures, so that whatever fonts are used
   are embedded, instead of being required remotely.  

2) make sure you're using outline fonts, but if that's not possible,

3) run dvips with a high resolution (dvips -Ppdf for instance), so
   there's at least a chance of the output looking good.

In general, using the "right" fonts in MP output seems to be a common
problem -- I've had it myself and don't know the best answer.
prologues:=0; (or some other setting of prologues) might help.

http://silas.psfc.mit.edu/elec_fig/ (Graphics for inclusion in
electionic documents, by Ian Hutchinson) may or may not be helpful.

If anyone would like to write a tutorial on this general
problem of getting nice figures from mf/mp into pdf files, we'd love to
publish it in TUGboat.  Or if there's something out there, so much the
better :).


Cheers,
karl

I disagree.

TeX makes up to three passes through the text: one with the tolerance
set to \pretolerance and no hyphenation, one with normal tolerance
and hyphenation, and one with \emergencystretch added to the glue.
The first of these passes is the quickest because it avoids all the
complications of hyphenation, and it is always performed although it
can be aborted early if a line is found with no feasible breakpoints.
The third pass isn't used in normal circumstances.

Setting \pretolerance to infinity makes the first pass succeed and
thus cuts out the second and third passes altogether.  However, it
does increase the number of feasible breakpoints per line which TeX
has to consider, and it's for this reason that this pass makes TeX
work harder than it does for the second pass in the special case
where none (or few) of the words admit hyphenations.  It turns out
in the particular configuration upon which I have tested it that
the \lefthyphenmin method is up to 10% faster than the \pretolerance
method and uses slightly less memory.  But there's a price: because the
tolerance is lower, TeX will tend to set lots of overfull \hboxes on the
more difficult paragraphs.  To fix this, you can raise the tolerance -
but this removes the advantage!

Subject: [texhax] Mailer
Message-ID: <E1BxdYr-0007xm-00@as220.org>


Hello all:

I have a little newsletter, and it is mailed by folding it over and
stamping the back.  I hacked together a couple of tables in macros,
one that prints the return address and makes a space for a stamp, and
another one for putting in the masthead.  They both work ok, but I
have to remember to put \masthead and \mailer in the text when I'm
getting near the appropriate place to put these bits.

Can anyone help me think of a way to make these always appear in the
same place in the document (masthead at the bottom of column 1 on page
2, mailer at the bottom of page 6, spanning both columns). 

I've tried a bunch of things, and have found a few methods that will
work, but nothing really satisfactory.  Tables work ok, but they often
wind up in the wrong place, especially two-column ones.  Redefining
the footer could work, I would have thought, but redefining
\textheight so it won't write over the footer is a pain.
(i.e. chngpage does work, but seems to require explicit page breaks).

Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome.  Copies of the newsletter are
at whatcheer.net in case the requirement isn't clear.

Many thanks,

-Tom

He did, actually. The carelessness came rather from my side, sorry about

the default papersize in ghostscript is NOT hardcoded, it is set in the
initalization file gs_init.ps, which is plain ASCII and can be edited by
everyone.

So if it were possible for some people to gain at least a little bit of
insight into a subject prior to posting on a mailing list, many flame wars
and nearly off-topic posts could be avoided.

I'm very reluctant to continue this flame war, but I thought I would
answer that, yes, the UK does indeed use Imperial measures for road
signs (speed limits etc) and (some) alcohol measures in pubs (pints
etc); but almost everything else is metric. In particular, we use A4
paper by default. But my main point is that the UK doesn't usually
consider itself to be "European", despite its membership of the EU.

It took ages for us to persuade Microsoft and other US companies to make
it easy to use A4 paper with their products, and the problem STILL
causes trouble today (witness the number of printers flashing the error
message "please load letter paper", holding up the entire queue).

I agree with your reaction.  In fact, I myself hate when people don't give fair
credit.  But please read below quote from my original message (archived at

I did not refer to the cite package as the macro I borrowed, according to the
FAQ, is a generalization of the one used in cite package.

By the way, would not it be useful to document in the FAQ situations when
\IsInteger could fail?  The ones I can think of are:

1. \IsInteger{ {23}} will say it has an integer (i.e., leading spaces and/or one
   level of braces are disregarded, due to the \gobbleminus helper).

2. When `<subject of test>' starts with a number, followed by an `_', followed
   by something else, \IsInteger gives truth, and `something else' followed by
   an `_' gets out into the output.

It has just come to my mind (might be a blunder, I did not do much testing)---it
seems to me that the first problem can be solved by eliminating the call to
\gobbleminus, like this:

  \def\IsInteger#1{%
    TT\fi
    \ifcat_\ifnum9<1\ifx-#1\else#1\fi _\else A\fi
  }

This trades one problem for another---now _trailing_ spaces are disregarded
(i.e., \IsInteger{23 } will give truth), but at least the braces problem is gone
now.  Do you see any problems with this?

Oleg Katsitadze

Well, I've been exploring the \label route as that seems most tractable.
I have something working in as much as I have the labels appearing
correctly, certainly an improvement; but in doing so, I've broken the
cross-referencing.  Maybe I could briefly pick your brain?  You'll
probably spot a solution in about 5 minutes.

The thing I'm trying to do is get a kind of literate programming tool
working.  My aim is for LaTeX to do the cross-referencing; I know it's
possible as noweb does it, though noweb.sty is full of arcania and
ludicrously long.

Here's my basic approach.  I've simplified it a little, though I don't
think that affects the logic.  The document contains sections of
(machine-generated) LaTeX that look like:

  \begin{pulpcode}{Landing geometry}{pulpchunk:1}
  \verb!float range = 4941.0, height = 274.0, speed = 79.74;!\\
  \verb!float runway_width = 49.0;!\\
  \pulpendcode
  \pulpmacused{}{\pulpchunkref{pulpchunk:25}}
  \end{pulpcode}

(The tool is called `pulp'.)  The first argument to the environment is
the title of the chunk of code and the second is a unique label string,
to be used for cross-referencing.  The environment is currently defined as

  \newenvironment{pulpcode}[2]{\begin{flushleft}\small
    \leavevmode\llap{\PULPlabel{#2}\qquad}
    $\langle$\textbf{#1}$\rangle=$\nopagebreak
    \begin{list}{}{\topsep 0pt\leftmargin 1.5em\itemsep=0pt}
    \begin{minipage}{\PULPcodewidth}
    \item}
  {\end{minipage}\end{list}\end{flushleft}\ignorespaces}

(It can probably stand some improvements.)

As you can see, \begin{pulpcode} invokes \PULPlabel to generate the
label for this chunk of code, and that is typeset in the left-hand
margin.  The remainder of the code is concerned with typesetting the
title and body of the section of code and need not concern us further.

With regard to setting the label, I have the following code:

  \RequirePackage{perpage}   

  \newcounter{pulpchunknumber}
  \MakePerPage{pulpchunknumber}

  \newcommand{\PULPlabel}[1]{\refstepcounter{pulpchunknumber}\label{#1}%
    \pageref{#1}\alph{pulpchunknumber}}

This seems to do what I want, in that \PULPlabel generates "1a",
"1b"... "2a", "2b"...  and the \label command is squirrelling it away in
the .aux file.  However if I use \ref with the appropriate label, I
don't get "1b", only something like "2", which I suspect is the chunk
number within that page.  Looking in the .aux file, I find lines like:

  \newlabel{pulpchunk:3}{{1b}{1}{The Landing Geometry\relax }{pulpchunknumber.2}{}}

which tends to confirm my suspicion.  However, I see that this line does
 have the "1b" in it -- I just don't know how to extract it!

Any suggestions?  I'm completely flummoxed!  And feeling very stupid.

I sincerely hope do : if they don't, I've been being short-changed
for a very long time, since I always ask for "a pint" and have
never yet been told "is a half-litre OK ?".  (Unlike asking for
a Coke, and being asked "Is Pepsi OK ?", which often happens ...).

	If you would gain some insight into a subject, then you would
	not trigger replies to inform you of your errors.  I was not
	the person complaining about ghostscript's behavior.   My
	complaint was about a2ps amd the modern versions of TeX and
	LaTeX where in order to learn the names of the configuration
	files, the relationships between the various configuration
	files and where the default assumptions were in the code, I
	had to read major amounts of the source code to locate a
	solution to my problem.  Furthermore, thank you for illustrating
	my point for me, the file name, gs_init.ps, does not indicate
	clearly that that is where the assumptions about paper size
	are stored.

	And, to me at least, TeX and LaTeX are the subjects of this
	mailing list.  The fact that TeX and LaTex now defaults to
	European paper sizes tell me that TeX and LaTeX support amd
	development has moved out of the United States of America
	where TeX and LaTex originated.  Before, Europeans had to
	put in A4 (after discovering the style file for that purpose);
	not, the Europeans seem have reversed that situation.

	And, we often see on our printers ``please load A4 paper''.
	Someone has to see that message and know that (for our HP,
	QMS, Tektronix and Xerox printers, at least) depressing
	the GO button equivalent causes the printer to proceed;
	otherwise, we suffer delays of the printer queues.
	I do that service on the printers near my office several
	times a day and at least once a week explain the GO
	button behavior to someone.  I also explain at least
	monthly that if one is formating a document (and this
	is quite applicable to TeX and LaTeX) and expects that
	the document will be printed in both North America and
	in ISO paper areas, to print the document in the lower
	left corner of the paper using the letter paper height
	(11in -- 279mm) and the A4 paper width (8.28in -- 210mm)
	so that the print image fits on both sizes of paper.

	I keep a small stock of A4 paper around (it is difficult
	and expensive to avail here) for those people whom need
	to print documents to be returned to Europe because their
	governments or institutions refuse to accept that document
	on letter paper.  This is inconveniencing their own people!

	It is still necessary to tell European companies that
	they need to remove the Europeanisms from their products
	if they expect them to sell at all well in the USA.
	I give you the example of the Siemens S46 GSM cell
	phone: it refuses to track incoming calls and insists
	that a postal code is 6 characters with a space and
	goes _before_ the city name; these are all wrong
	in the USA.  The AT&T Wireless GSM system uses the
	Siemens S46 as one of the cellphones for that system;
	I have owned two of them before I insisted that AT&T
	offer me another type, perhaps from Motorola, because
	of these behaviors among other Europeanisms in the phones.

	And, not to worry, Microsoft causes us problems with
	letter paper as well.  Microsoft does not know how to
	generate proper Document Structure Commented PostScript
	print files and seems not to understand the difference
	between PostScript print files and Encapsulated PostScript
	figure files to be incorporated into print files.

Well, while you're at it, perhaps you could convince your
fellow Americans that "U" (as in "United States of America")
is the /21st/ letter of the alphabet, and not the first : it
would be really nice if, when attempting to install some American-
written software, the the first entry in the (otherwise
alphabetically ordered) drop-down country list were "Afghanistan"
or similar rather than "United States of America" ...

I'm amazed that even a Motorola was good enough for use in America;
surely Motorola still require the date to be entered in "A.D."
("Anno Domini") format rather than "A.B." ("After Bush") ...

Hello Anh,

 \documentclass{article}
 \usepackage{graphicx}
 \begin{document}
    \includegraphics[width=6cm,angle=-90]{FooBar}
 \end{document}

should work.  The correct graphics driver is loaded automatically.
The \ifpdf code is already in graphics.cfg.

\includegraphics finds the correct file if you omit the filename
extension in the mandatory argument.

This is documented in .../texmf-dist/doc/latex/graphics/grfguide.ps

Regards,

I usually ignore these off-topic posts so that posts rapidly come back to the 
main interest of Lists' readers. But I cannot avoid adding my comment on 
Randolph Herber's messages on this thread. They are so plagued with egotistic 
views that ignoring them would contribute to perpetuate this sort of 
attitudes.

What errors?

First of all, you started a completely inapropriate off-topic discussion. 
Second, YOUR erroneous assumption that paper sizes are hard coded in 
Ghostscript was pointed out to you by Paul Wagner. Thirdly, Jeroen Wijnhout 
pointed out to you that letter (not A4, which you were venting your 
frustration for) is the default paper size in the software in question. 
Further,

Exactly where does Jeroen's message deny you any privilege?

This implies that, In your view, default parameters should always remain the 
same as those in place in Littleville, where the software developers happen 
to live. Would you please provide a good reason why this should be so? There 
is so much we can learn by looking at how other people, in other parts of the 
world, accomplish the same tasks. More often than not, we may discover better 
and more efficient ways of performing them. Moreover, you haven't showed us 
in what way it "is quite annoying to spend a day locating the points...". You 
must be aware that some people may not find "annoying" the same things you 
do. You must provide information to allow others to judge by THEMSELVES what 
is annoying and what not. When you say:

you don't even mention what these products are, so we cannot tell if these 
problems are present (or related to) in any of the LaTeX packages; the focus 
of this List. If you have a problem changing a default in a certain package, 
you should provide the name of the package and other relevant information. 
Because your message did not contain this basic information, it comes out as 
helpless whining.

Those unruly europeans, don't they realize TeX/LaTeX is a U.S.A. creation so 
they should default to U.S.A. standards? Now, seriously, can you tell us why 
should everybody default to standards that are used by less than 0.1% of the 
world population? Mr. Herber's answer to this question may reflect his view 
that:

Where in the world did Mr. Herber get his idea that the U.S.A. is a major 
portion of the world's economy? Having lots of money may mean large economic 
power, but in no sense can it mean BEING a large portion of the world's 
economy. Perhaps Mr. Herber forgot that people, not money, are the main 
component of the world's economy. That is why it will be extremely more 
difficult to default more than 6 billion people to adhere to standards used 
by less than 300 million, won't it?  But then again, economic extorsion 
(which may be what Mr. Herber was referring to above) may go a long way in 
this sense.

Yes, let's not listen to this biased opinion. Instead, let's listen to Mr. 
Herber's objective and impartial analysis of the advantages and disadvantages 
of ISO (The International Organization for Standardization, please note the 
first word, Mr. Herber) vs. U.S.A. paper sizes:

I sincerely hope that the sort of views expressed by Mr. Herber's are not the 
rule in countries with 'lots of money'. It has certainly not been my 
experience living in several of the so-called 'first world countries', 
including the one Mr. Herber's hails from, Canada, and France. If anything, 
my universe and my sense of freedom have benefited from learning other 
PEOPLE's 'standards'.

This is not good practice.

No, it is NOT a separate paragraph. It's a display (displayed equation or formula) and is an integral part of the encompassing paragraph. Only displays may have labels in good typography.

If you are skipping a line in the source code before and after each and every \begin{equation}...\end{equation} or $$...$$ pair, you are almost certainly setting the material incorrectly.

    After a couple of hours searching for an answer I gave up. Here is my
    question:

    I would like to put verbatim text inside merged cells (columns). \texttt
    does not give nice results
    since underlines '_' tend to be to close to subsequent characters. I know I
    am just another "put
    \verb inside an argument'-guy but I have not found any answer to this
    particular problem.

    \multicolumn{ 2 }{ l }{ \verb{verbatim_text} } \\

    Any suggestions?

\texttt won't use the _ character from the tt font.
instead it uses a drawn rule that *may* be okay for
ordinary text (though i'm not fond of it there either
and usually redefine it).

but you can force the tt _ character:

    \multicolumn{ 2 }{ l }{ \textt{verbatim\char`\_text} } \\

or define a command to get it:

    \newcommand{\uline}{\texttt{\char`\_}}

    \multicolumn{ 2 }{ l }{ \textt{verbatim\uline text} } \\

good luck.

Not reading the documentation at all but trying to get the desired
information by reading the source code is by far the most stupidest
way to solve such problems.

Did you ever try "info a2ps"?  I just got the information how to
change the paper format within 20 seconds, and there was no need to
look into the sources.

What you say about TeX and LaTeX is just pure nonsense.  TeX was
designed by Knuth, an American (if this imortant for you), and the
code is frozen for yaers now.  It assumes letter paper.  Though LaTeX
is now mainly maintained by Europeans, it still defaults to letter
paper.  I absolutely do not understand what you complain about.

    > Furthermore, thank you for illustrating my point for me, the

But the documentation does.

It doesn't have anything to do where TeX was developed.  If Knuth
would develop TeX today, it certainly would default to ISO standards.

    >  Before, Europeans had to put in A4
    > (after discovering the style file for that purpose); 

Yes, no problem at all, we Europeans look into documentation and just
set the recommended variables.  I'm still wondering how someone can be
so stupid to read the source code before looking into the
deocumentatiion.  Quite strange.  But you are a citizen of the United
States of America, so I suppose that you know what you are doing.

    > not, the

Not really yet, that would be quite good, and I'd like to volunteer.

While mostly I agree w/ Reinhard's informative post, I don't think this 
would be likely to be the case, simply because it's not that common / 
easy to get anything other than letter, legal and tabloid paper here in 
the US.

I'll bet long odds and family heirlooms that DEK is proofing the next 
vol. (4?) of TAoCP on letter-sized paper.

Certainly it would have a better / more flexible scheme for selecting 
paper, and hopefully wouldn't have the hard-wired 1in. v/h offset.

I for one think it's wonderful that so many apps (esp. printer drivers) 
are so nice about letting one pick paper sizes from such a wide variety 
(and I wish there was a larger variety / more standards --- I still 
think we should get a printer to cut 9" x 12" stock for printing stuff 
with bleeds and that the savings on shipping (over tabloid) would make 
up for the expense quite quickly).

If I got you right, the following does the job:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%begin of myfile.tex%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newwrite\blue

\immediate\openout\blue=bluefile

\outer\def\putstuffoverthere#1#2{\immediate\write\blue{#1,& #2!\cr}}

\putstuffoverthere{Hallo}{folks}
\putstuffoverthere{Goodbye}{folks}

\immediate\closeout\blue

{\catcode`@=11 \halign{#&#\cr\input bluefile }}

\bye
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%end of myfile.tex%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


If you don't need the \catcode`@=11, the example above can
work without it.

\putstuffoverthere{Goodbye}{folks}

\immediate\closeout\blue

{\catcode`@=11 \halign{#&#\cr\input bluefile }}

\bye
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%end of myfile.tex%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


(If you don't need the \catcode`@=11, the example above can
work without it)

Another solution:  if you want \halign to be written out to
bluefile.tex, try this (I use \lbracechar and \rbracechar
from eplain package):


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%begin of myfile.tex%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input eplain

\newwrite\blue

\immediate\openout\blue=bluefile
{\catcode`#=11 \immediate\write\blue{\halign\lbracechar #&#\cr}}

\outer\def\putstuffoverthere#1#2{\immediate\write\blue{#1, #2!\cr}}

\putstuffoverthere{Hallo}{folks}
\putstuffoverthere{Goodbye}{folks}

\immediate\write\blue{\rbracechar}
\immediate\closeout\blue

\input bluefile

\bye
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%end of myfile.tex%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


(The \catcode`#=11 is to prevent TeX from doubling the `#'
in the bluefile.tex)

And another one.  Here, you can control what your alignment
entries look like by redefining \alignentry, it seems to me
more general than the previous two:


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%begin of myfile.tex%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input eplain

\newwrite\blue

\immediate\openout\blue=bluefile

\outer\def\putstuffoverthere#1#2{\begingroup\toks0{#1}\toks2{#2}%
  \immediate\write\blue{\noexpand\alignentry{\the\toks0}{\the\toks2}}\endgroup}

\putstuffoverthere{Hallo}{folks}
\putstuffoverthere{Goodbye}{fo\thinspace lks}

\immediate\closeout\blue

\def\alignentry#1#2{#1,&#2!\cr}
\halign{#&#\cr\input bluefile }

\bye
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%end of myfile.tex%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


(The tricks with \toks0 and \toks2 are to prevent expansion
of any expandables in the text of the parameters; for
instance, the \thinspace in `Goodbye, fo\thinspace lks!'
gets written out into bluefile.tex as `\thinspace', not as
`\kern <something>')

If you need a more sophisticated processing of parameters of
\putstuffoverthere, see \writenumberedcontentsentry in
xeplain.tex of eplain package, or maybe even use their
\definecontentsfile mechanism.

Subject: [texhax] makeindex breaks up index group on a capitalized entry
Message-ID: <20040821140755.GC3234@thor>

Thanks to the top-grade comments by Thomas Esser and Olaf
Weber, my problem (see thread "[tex-k] \write writes out
TeX's `^^' quartets instead of 8-bit chars") is fully
resolved now.

Now I have another problem, but I am not sure this is the
right place to post it to.  If it actually is not, could
someone please kindly recommend me an appropriate mailing
list?

I now post this message to tex-k@tug.org,
tex-eplain@tug.org, and texhax@tug.org (people who are
subscribed to few of these, please don't be too hard on
me---I don't know where to seek help).

I've already tried posting to CyrTeX-ru mailing list which
deals with Russian/Cyrillic TeXing, but nothing came out of
it (mailing list <CyrTeX-ru.vsu.ru>, message at
https://info.vsu.ru/Lists/CyrTeX-ru/Message/2199.html, but
it's all in Russian; below I give translation into English,
with more details.)



The problem I have is related to generating Cyrillic indices
with makeindex(1) by Pehong Chen, version 2.14 [02-Oct-2002]
(kpathsea + Thai support).

I use tetex-bin 2.0.2-10, Web2C 7.4.5 on Debian GNU/Linux
2004-04-02 Sid.

I use plain TeX format and I read in eplain macro package,
but it seems that my problem is local to makeindex.

I have these for my locale settings:

$ echo $LC_CTYPE; echo $LC_COLLATE
LC_COLLATE=ru_RU.KOI8-R
LC_CTYPE=ru_RU.KOI8-R


where ru_RU.KOI8-R is the locale for Russian with KOI8-R
encoding (my TeX sources and intermediate files are all in
this encoding).

The source file is:

--------------------start testidx.tex--------------------
\input eplain

\idx{Meksika}
\idx{martyshka}
\idx{motylyok}
\idx{moloko}
\idx{masshtab}
\idx{marazm}

\readindexfile{i}

\bye
--------------------end testidx.tex--------------------

(I have transliterated index entries into Latin, in the
actual testidx.tex they are all equivalent Cyrillic
characters from the extended ASCII.)

Now I run

$ tex -translate-file=cp8bit testidx
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.4.5)
 (/usr/share/texmf/web2c/cp8bit.tcx)
(./testidx.tex (/usr/share/texmf/tex/eplain/eplain.tex)
No index file testidx.ind. [1] )
(see the transcript file for additional information)
Output written on testidx.dvi (1 page, 200 bytes).
Transcript written on testidx.log.


and get testidx.idx:

--------------------start testidx.idx--------------------
\indexentry{Meksika}{1}
\indexentry{martyshka}{1}
\indexentry{motylyok}{1}
\indexentry{moloko}{1}
\indexentry{masshtab}{1}
\indexentry{marazm}{1}
--------------------end testidx.idx--------------------

(again, I transliterated Cyrillic chars into Latin).  So far
so good.  Now, when I run

$ makeindex -L testidx.idx
This is makeindex, version 2.14 [02-Oct-2002] (kpathsea +
Thai support).
Scanning input file testidx.idx....done (6 entries accepted,
0 rejected).
Sorting entries....done (17 comparisons).
Generating output file testidx.ind....done (16 lines
written, 0 warnings).
Output written in testidx.ind.
Transcript written in testidx.ilg.


I get the following in my testidx.ind:

--------------------start testidx.ind--------------------
\begin{theindex}

  \item marazm, 1
  \item martyshka, 1
  \item masshtab, 1

  \indexspace

  \item Meksika, 1

  \indexspace

  \item moloko, 1
  \item motylyok, 1

\end{theindex}
--------------------end testidx.ind--------------------

(again, I transliterated Cyrillic chars into Latin).  As you
can see, index entries are sorted correctly, even the
capitalized `Meksika' got into right place, but makeindex
broke up the group for letter `m' on the capitalized word.
makeindex does not do this for index entries in Latin chars.

What puzzled me the most is that makeindex sorted entries
correctly, knowing that Cyrillic `M' is a capitalized
Cyrillic `m', which indicates that makeindex applied my
locale settings (it does correct _sorting_ even on more
complex inputs, with entries starting on many different
letters), but still it _broke up the group for letter `m'_
on a capitalized word.

I must have skipped a step or two, or maybe I misunderstand
how makeindex works with locale settings?  Or maybe I need a
special style file for makeindex to stop breaking Cyrillic
index groups on capitalized entries?

Thanks in advance for any clues on this.

Oleg Katsitadze

To avoid reading in eplain, you can always add the
definitions for \lbracechar and \rbracechar to your
(macro)file.  You can even add a definition for \hashchar so
you don't need to \catcode`#=11 before you write out the
preamble of \halign:

\begingroup
  \catcode`\# = 11
  \gdef\hashchar{#}%
  \catcode`\{ = 12 \catcode`\} = 12
  \catcode`\[ = 1 \catcode`\] = 2
  \gdef\lbracechar[{]%
  \gdef\rbracechar[}]%
\endgroup


Now you can write out the preamble like this (no prior
`\input eplain' required):

\immediate\write\blue{\halign\lbracechar\hashchar&\hashchar\cr}%


If you are not comfortable with the above definitions, here
is a clue:  we temporarily change category codes of special
chars while we define macros for them.  We do this in a
group so that catcodes will revert to the original values
after the group ends.  Later, these macros will expand to
those same characters, but with category codes they had at
the time of definition, not category codes they will have at
the time of expansion (we kind of `freeze' category codes of
these chars within definitions of macros).

Actually, it seems you get this message only when
bluefile.tex exists but is empty.  If no bluefile.tex exists
at all (i.g., at the first run of TeX over source file), you
get a fatal

! I can't find file `bluefile'.
l.9   \halign{#&#\cr \input bluefile 
                                     }%
Please type another input file name


Once again, to work this out I suggest using eplain's
\testfileexistence macro.  If you absolutely need to avoid
using eplain, you can maybe copy definitions from the
sources of eplain.  Anyway, now the part which reads in
bluefile.tex will look like this:

\testfileexistence[bluefile]{tex}% you may omit `tex' (give {})
\iffileexists{\catcode`@=11
  \halign{#&#\cr \input bluefile }%
}\fi

you've got an empty bluefile

in any case, i would write:

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newread \testin

...

\openin \testin bluefile
\ifeof\testin
  \closein \testin % file didn't exist
\else
  \read\testin to \temp
  \ifeof\testin
    \closein \testin % file empty
  \else
    \closein \testin
    {\catcode`@=11
    \halign{#&#\cr \input bluefile }%
    }

Thanks to Oleg Katsitadze and Robin Fairbairns's precious help.
The problem seems to be worked out now.
It came up because the `bluefile.tex' 
had not been created yet at the moment of \input,
and some kind of fileexistence test was necessary.
Both the \testfileexistence eplain command and the \testin macro
do the job very well, it seems.

It is curious that, if I want to insert a \refn{label} 
inside a `\putstuffoverthere' command,
I have to write \noexpand\refn{label} instead of simply \refn{label}.
But it *does* expand actually, when it has to.

Cheers,

Forgive me for asking, but what /is/ the difference between "virgule"
and "solidus"?  Which TeX chars are we talking about?

The TeXbook doesn't seem to make any distinction between those words,
and neither does my dictionary.  (It all sounds a bit like a case of
"ocean grey vs military grey"...)

Unfortunately, [1,2] is not the same interval as (1,2).  (And [1,2) is
another interval again.)

I know, therefore I prefer the notation [1, 2] for a closed interval, [1, 2[
for an interval open on the right side and so on. Advantage: No confusion
between (1, 2) (interval open on both sides) and (1, 2) (tupel or 1-by-2
matrix or transposed R^2-vector with the elements 1 and 2).

Google lead me to   http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Solidus.html
                    http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Virgule.html
However, from these pages it appears that both symbols can be used
for division.
 
I hope someone else can provide a more complete answer.

The solidus and virgule are different characters, no question about it.

The virgule is primarily used for level fractions such as $2\pi/3$ or in  
running text as "he/she threw an apple at the doctor to keep him away". It  
can also be used as an alternative to comma in Herlev / Denmark / Earth or  
in dates 2004/08/23.

The solidus slopes much more (typically close to 45 degrees) and is used  
for split level fractions as "He took 7/8 of the pie."

The TeXbook not mentioning them is connected to the fact that Knuth didn't  
incorporate the solidus or ready-made fractions like 1/2 (you know the  
character, but I'll stick to ascii here). The fractions and solidus in the  
EC fonts have a somewhat unusual design, which didn't help matters much,  
if at all. The Latin Modern fonts on the other hand show a clear  
distinction between the solidus and virgule, as does almost any other font  
I can think of.

The documentation of the xfrac package (okay, I'll stop advertising ;-)  
contains a brief discussion of this topic.

The example file below shows how the solidus and virgule look in various  
fonts. The character width of the Latin Modern solidus will hopefully be  
fixed in an upcoming release (the authors have been notified).

Message-ID: <200408231221.i7NCLFX07538@tug.org>

Hello,

I've got a large table with a lot of column-spanning (\multicolumn)
entries. I want to make it clear when a short-ish entry spans several
columns by ruling a centred horizontal line either side of the centred
entry.

The code:

... & \multicolumn{4}{c}{\hrulefill Something \hrulefill} & ...

does this quite well, the only problem is that the rule is sitting on
the baseline. I'd like the rule to be centred, say at half the
x-height. The problem is that no amount of \raisebox{}ing seems to help
here as all the box commands want a definite width, not a rubber one! On
the other hand, the basic TeX commands don't seem to play nicely with
rubber lengths. 

I'm using tabularx so I don't know the exact column-widths, and it's
clear that tex can do the maths, it's just the rule is a few points too
low. 

Thanks for any help!

I did that, and did some experimenting.  I actually had
written a small test program:


#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <locale.h>


int main(void)
{
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
    putchar(tolower('M'));
    return 0;
}


where the parameter to tolower() was actually an uppercase
Cyrillic `M', and it did downcase it (with
LC_ALL=ru_RU.KOI8-R).  But when I added:


#define TOLOWER(C) ( (unsigned char)tolower((unsigned char)(C)) )


to the makeindex source, as you recommended, it still did
not do any good.  So I checked the source you provided for
makeindex, and this is what I came up with:

- sortid.c sets current locale only temporarily (for
  LC_COLLATE) while doing the sorting, and resets `old'
  locale thereafter;

- genind.c does not set the locale at all when generating
  the output.

Thus, tolower() is not locale-enabled during index
generation, hence the breaking of the group.

Below I include the patch which seemed to work out the
problem for me.  Note that it changes locale for LC_CTYPE
and then resets it back for each of the index entries.  I am
not sure that it could be moved upper for optimization
purposes, without breaking something else.  Could you please
look at it, or recommend somebody else to whom I should
submit it?


Many thanks,
Oleg Katsitadze

    clear that tex can do the maths, it's just the rule is a few points too

in plain tex, you can use a rule with a negative depth
to raise it.  for a rule of thickness 1pt, 2.5pt above
the baseline:

    \vrule height 3.5pt depth-2.5pt width.1fil

this is a \vrule because in a table cell, you're in
horizontal mode.  i'm not positive that .1fil will do
what you want in a tabular situation, but it's worth
a try.

the equivalent in latex would be

    \rule[2.5pt]{.1fil}{1pt}

where 2.5pt = "lift" above baseline, 1pt = height of rule
itself, and .1fil = width -- and i really *don't* know
whether "fil" can be used in this situation; you hint
that it may not, but \rule's follow different rules than
boxes.  all else about the latex \rule is covered in the
excellent book by kopka & daly.

Try something like

\newcommand*\myhrulefill{%
   \leavevmode\leaders\hrule depth-2pt height 2.4pt\hfill\kern0pt
}

TeX then draws a rule which upper border is 2.4pt above the baseline and  
lower border 2pt above the baseline.

I am not familiar with \multicolumn but I think the
following might be adopted for it (I use \halign which
should also be what \multicolumn uses):


\def\crulefill{\leaders\hbox{\raise.5ex\hbox to5pt{\hrulefill}}\hfill}

\halign{\hfil#\hfil&\hfil#\hfil\cr
1 column& 2 column\cr
\crulefill 1\crulefill& 2\cr
}

This seems to work perfectly:


\def\crulefill{\leaders\vrule height 3.5pt depth-2.5pt\hfill}

\halign{\hfil#\hfil&\hfil#\hfil\cr
1 column& 2 column\cr

With \noexpand, \refn gets expanded on the reading phase,
not on the writing phase.  Without \noexpand, it expands on
the writing phase, thus on the reading phase the low-level
commands to which \refn expanded cause trouble.  (Compare
contents of bluefile.tex after a single run of TeX on
myfile.tex with and without \noexpand.)

Subject: [texhax] Small caps for appendix A, B, C?
Message-ID: <200408240254.i7O2sgb05787@tug.org>

Hi tex people,

It's so nice to find a list with people just as obsessed with typography
as I am :) I'm trying to get appendix letters to come out in small caps,
but:

\renewcommand\thechapter{\textsc{\Alph{chapter}}

and similar don't seem to work. I know how to change formatting just for
titles, headers etc but it seems a bit daft to have to manually change
it everywhere \thechapter is rendered. Or is that what I have to do?

Thanks!

umm, don't you mean

\renewcommand\thechapter{\textsc{\alph{chapter}} ?

Umm, yes, I did mean that :)

But the problem was not that my small-caps weren't small, but a latex
error. Latex runs fine until it encounters a subfigure and then says

! Undefined control sequence.
\reserved@a ->\@nil 
                    
l.706   \noindent\subfigure
                           [Blah blah...]

Perhaps this is a bug in the subfig package, but I assumed that it was
naughty to redefine \thechapter to contain formatting
instructions. Latex runs fine, and subfig is happy, if I don't redefine
\thechapter.

Hi:

How do you \includegraphics in a transparent manner?

Case in point: I have a B/W pdf image, that I want to set on a yellow

(Note: going .gif not good, I am using pdftex.)

Next step:  How do I change colors while including, for example, to 
substitute blue instead of black?

Hi,

When I had a similar problem, I solved it by generating again the pdf figure.
In my case, I had a xmgrace figure. I generated again the pdf figure without
any background at all. In this way, as you insert it into your latex document
by using \includegraphics, the figure respects the background of the original
document.

I hope this hint is useful for you. I am sorry. No idea of how you can control
these features while including with \includegraphics.

David.

    Just curious if anybody of you knows about the current state of Omega

Omega itself is still being worked on, as you note.

There is an omega-system.sourceforge.net now, set up fairly recently,
but unfortunately I don't think it has ever become active, in terms of
source being uploaded, etc.  And the home page there redirects to
http://omega.cse.unsw.edu.au, so that's no help.  (The home page for
Omega has always been quite unstable, sadly.)

One related project is aleph (formerly eOmega), which adds e-tex to
Omega, fixes some nagging minor bugs that impact practical use, etc.
That project is led by Giuseppe Bilotta.  Again, I don't know of any
public web site for it.

We do include aleph and Omega in TeX Live, so you can find last year's
sources on those CD's.  If you want to see the current development
sources, let me know.

There were several papers at TUG 2003 about aleph and omega.  See
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents24-1.html (multilingual document
processing).  You can find contact addresses for the various people in
those papers.

    and where there might be an active mailing list dedicated to it.

I do not know of any active mailing list :(.

In general, common/public infrastructure has always been sadly lacking
with Omega ...

karl

Alternatively, if you can't easily regenerate the pdf figure, convert it
to a png, which graphicx/pdflatex will understand ok. Then edit the png
to give the transparency you require (I've not done this, but I guess it
works ok as png supports transparency. You probably need to use
intelligent scissors to cut out the image and then paste it onto a
transparent background. The alternative, namely defining the white
colour to be transparent will put holes inside your image if there is
white inside as well).

I wouldn't ask \includegraphics to do this kind of image manipulation.
There are a whole host of applications (gimp, image magick, photoshop,
paint shop pro, ...) depending on your platform which are designed to do
it.

Have a look at the "listings" package, or even the "alltt" environment.

Dear List,

After installing TeX-Live on my system (Debian/Linux), I seem to have ruined 
my access to info files. Typing "info" or "info <anything>" gives 
"/usr/bin/info: No such file or directory". I can't do absolutely anything 
with the info command. On the other hand, everything in TeX-Live works Ok.

I chose to add symlinks to /usr/info and /usr/man in the TeX-Live 
installation's script, so I must have ruined something with that. However, 
man works without problems and even lets me access the newly installed 
documentation.

Looking at the two directories mentioned above within emacs shows /usr/info 
being symlinked to share/info (notice there's no slash before 'share'), 
while /usr/man is not symlinked at all. I'm not experienced enough with 
symlinks to go deeper on this.

Thanks in advance for any help spotting where the problem is.

Best, Sebastian

i guess this is interesting.  I've never really looked at this before.  if
it's looking for info at /usr/bin/info, just make a symlink to it.  do a

which info

to find out where it is (mine's at /usr/info which is a symlink to
/usr/share/info, and so is yours, i gather), just do a

ln -s /usr/share/info /usr/bin/info

root will have to do this.  Oh, and i sometimes get the order backwards.
i think this is right, but if it says it already exists, then switch em

I would not advise this.  /usr/share/info is a directory containing
info-files, while /usr/bin/info is a program for viewing info-files.
Besides, the original poster said that /usr/bin/info is missing, so
"which info" would most likely not be able to find it.

If the debsums package is installed, type "debsums info" to find out
whether the info package is properly installed.  If it spots an error,
you may have to reinstall this package.

Without further info (pun not intended) it's a bit difficult to help.
But /usr/info (or /usr/share/info) is most likely a red herring if
the error message is referring to /usr/bin/info.

It seems your info executable (/usr/bin/info) is gone.  See
if it's still there:

  $ ls /usr/bin/info

If it gives something like

  ls: /usr/bin/info: No such file or directory

it is gone.  Try reinstalling info:

  $ apt-get remove info
  $ apt-get install info

I have no idea why your /usr/bin/info got removed---I've
never installed TeX Live myself.

Hope this helps you get your info straight.

Subject: [texhax] Verbatim environment in LaTeX
Message-ID: <517637535.20040826211806@tpg.com.au>

Dear Listers,

  I'm trying to reduce the size of the text inside a verbatim
  environment in order to stop the display of some regression results
  spilling across into the right margin. Verbatim is needed because
  the maths symbols etc freak out LaTeX.

  I've tried redefining the verbatim environment but without success.
  So I've then tried creating a new verbatim environment, but that
  doesn't work either. Any advice would be most appreciated.

  My command, in the preamble:

  \newenvironment{myverbatim}{\small\begin{verbatim}}{\end{verbatim}\normalsize}

  Causes the following error message, after it encounters

Runaway argument?

. sysuse auto
. regress price weight length foreign

      So\ETC.
! File ended while scanning use of \@xverbatim.
<inserted text> 
                \par   


This occurs straight after the compiler encounters \begin{myverbatim}.

Thanks for any help.

Thanks for your long and very informative answer. 

Sad state of affairs. I've first heard of Omega by hearsay in 1999,
but did not follow it up then because it sounded somewhat too much in
flux and neither sufficient documentation nor source were available
(or so it appeared to me). Now, things aren't all that different, it
seems...

I checked the omega-system.sourceforge.net URL, though to no avail....

Never heard of e-tex. A google search pointed me to a Eclipse plug in
for LaTeX of that name -- doesn't quite seem to fit the bill.

I need to get up to speed again with all those new acronyms ;-)

I made an improvement to the code.sty package once with which you can
arrange for the verbatim material to be of a different size, and to be
indented different amounts.  All the verbatim text is stuck into a
box, so it's only appropriate for shorter amounts, essentially what
will fit on a page, and results are best when it's less.  Anyone is
welcome to it.  It's called vcode.sty, and the dtx and ins files are
available at dodsdev.gso.uri.edu/DODS-doc/latex.

Even if it doesn't do what you want, you can use it as a model of how
to hack with verbatim, which is a hairy and abnormal business.

i went to an omega meeting (at cern) in the early-mid 1990s, and the
delivery promises made there weren't met.  john plaice gave an
interesting talk (extempore -- i don't think we got a paper out of it)
at tug2000, and the delivery promises made there weren't met.

i'm told there will be announcements at tug2004, happening any minute
now in greece.  i shall be interested to see the upshot of any
delivery promises made there.

the faq has a series of things about all these projects.  look at

i find it hard to imagine what maths symbols you can't put in
"ordinary" latex, that you can put in verbatim.  in general, (la)tex
deals with maths, whereas most other systems (plain text included)
just don't.

to first order, you can't do anything with verbatim in the argument of
a command.  even if that command is \newenvironment.  (your command
wouldn't work, anyway, since the \small would affect the \baselineskip
of the text immediately before it.)

there are exceptions to the rule about verbatim, of course, but you
don't need them.  the fancyvrb package does pretty much everything
anyone could want of verbatim, not limited to mere size changes.

    I chose to add symlinks to /usr/info and /usr/man in the TeX-Live 
    installation's script

I'll see if I can debug what happened.  FWIW, in general, I try to avoid
ever changing anything in /usr with "local" (as opposed to system)
updates.  Of course TL should not erase the info binary just because you
asked for the symlinks.

Anyway, you should just reinstall the Debian Texinfo packages and resume
life.  You can make the symlinks by hand to the info files under TL, if
need be.  Info searches a lot of directories by default, so perhaps it
will pick them up.  Depends on where you installed TL.

	The order is simple to remember: think of it as a move (mv)
	or a copy (cp).  In many UNIX-like operating systems, mv, cp
	and ln are the same executable with several links (names).

	BTW, you probably want: ln -sf /usr/share/info /usr/bin/info
	assuming the executable is /usr/share/info and the new, desired
	name is /usr/bin/info.

Hi,

Thanks for your help so far narrowing this down. Here is a more complete 
description of what I did in TeX-live's installation script (<return> omitted 
for brevity):

sh install-tl.sh
S B					# to select the texlive-full scheme.
D 1 /usr/share/TeX		# to specify the $TEXDIR, which automatically.
					# set $TEXMFLOCAL=/usr/share/TeX/texmf-local.
					# and $VARTEXMF=/usr/share/TeX/texmf-var.
O L
/usr/bin
/usr/man
/usr/info				# to create the symlinks to the specified paths.
I					# to start the installation.

I subsequently added /usr/share/TeX/bin/i386-linux to my PATH variable 
in /etc/profile.

TeX-live added the symlinks in the directories specified, and 
now /usr/bin/info is a symlink to /usr/share/TeX/bin/i386-linux/info. So it 
seems that TeX-live replaced my original info binary for that symlink, which 
doesn't work in my system. Additionally, I no longer have an info directory 
within Emacs, even though all the info files are there in /usr/info.

I followed Karl Berry's suggestion to reinstall the texinfo package, which I 
did by uninstalling it first and then installing it again through apt. 
However, I couldn't do the same with info. It uninstalled OK, but after 
apt-get install info, I got the following message:

No `START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY' and no `This file documents'.
install-info(/usr/share/info/info-stnd.info): unable to determine description 
for `dir' entry - giving up
dpkg: error processing info (--configure):
 subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1
Errors were encountered while processing:
 info
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)


[sigh], it looks like I'm again in need of some input. I know this is getting 
a bit off-topic to texhax, but since it's related to TeX-live, I don't know 
where else to turn to. Thank you.

Sebastian

Actually,

% mv a b

means move a TO b

while

% ln -s a b

gives:

% ls -l b
lrwx------  1 root  wheel  1 26 Aug 12:22 b@ -> a

that is, it makes a link TO a FROM b.  That's why it is hard
to remember, it's backwards from what one expects.

For this reason I use a script, lk:

#!/bin/csh -f
#(ie run the cshell on this but don't read the .cshrc)

# lk: link NAME to FILE

switch ($#argv)
  case 0:
    echo version = 1.06 of lk 2001 Nov 5
    # 2001 Nov  5, 1.06 object if file exists
    # 2000 Nov 30, 1.05 allow for spaces in manes (passed in quotes)
    # 2000 Oct 19, 1.04 protect if file is there
    # 1989 November 6, 1.00 origin
    echo Thomas Schneider, toms@ncifcrf.gov
    echo ' '
    echo Link the first argument to the name given
    echo in the second argument:
    echo ' '
    echo 'lk NAME (to) FILE'
    echo ' '
    echo 'You can even make links if the file has spaces by surrounding'
    echo 'the names with quotes:'
    echo ' '
    echo 'lk "Multipart NAME" "multipart FILE"'
  breaksw

  case 1:
    echo 'Two arguments needed\!'
  breaksw

  case 2:
    if !(-f "$1") then
      ln -s "$2" "$1"
    else
      echo 'lk: refuse to link: '$1' exists\!'
      exit
    endif
    if (! -f "$2" && ! -d "$2") then
       echo "WARNING: file or directory "$2" DOES NOT EXIST (yet?)"
    endif
  breaksw

  default:
    echo 'Too many arguments\!'
  breaksw
endsw

   Obviously, I do not know what I am talking about, I only have been
   supporting UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems for about a quarter
   century, including a decade at AT&T Bell Laboratories at Indian Hill
   in Naperville, IL.

$ ls a b
Cannot access a: No such file or directory
Cannot access b: No such file or directory
$ touch a
$ ls a b
Cannot access b: No such file or directory
a
$ ln -s a b
$ ls -l a b
-rw-r--r--    1 herber   g163           0 Aug 26 12:14 a
lrwxrwxrwx    1 herber   g163           1 Aug 26 12:14 b -> a
$

The order is source then target.  The new ``thing'' is on the right.
It is the same order for all of mv, cp and ln.

ln -s source target	Create a symbolic link to source at target.
cp source target	Make a copy of source at target.
mv source target	Move source to target.

If target is a directory, then it becomes ``in(to) target.''

I admit that when either are device files, sockets or named pipes,
then the rules get a tiny bit strange.  But, that only affects the
semantics of the operation and not the operand order.

Dear Robin,

  about verbatim, since my other environment definitions or
  redefinitions worked OK. I'll look into fancyvrb.

  The bit about maths symbols was not that Latex can't handle them,
  since I do this all the time with inline $ delimiters. Rather, the
  fact that I didn't want them treated at maths. That is, didn't want
  to have to insert dozens of $s and put up with font changes.

  Thanks again for you help.

The verbatim envionment is indeed different.  A \begin{...} changes
LaTeX's behaviour and an \end{...} restores the original state.

A \begin{verbatim} causes LaTeX not to regard a "\" as an escape
character or a brace as a group delimiter or a "$" as a math delimiter.

The problem is that \end{verbatim} then is not be treated as a control
sequence any more.  So the verbatim environment does not work like the
other ones.  Your guess was correct.

  Reinhard

Hi Sebastian,

So your idea was to replace the Debian installation of TeX with TeX Live?

Unfortunately, this is simply not a good idea.  The fact is, the Linux
distributions don't use anything remotely like TeX Live.  They use a
completely different directory structure and are based on teTeX (usually
of some ancient vintage, although perhaps Debian is doing better these
days, I don't know).

So replacing the Debian-controlled files in /usr/bin (especially) with
something else is bound to lead to trouble.  (The same is true for
anything, not just TL; it's best to leave system directories for the
system to mess with, in my experience.)

The idea of that symlink option is for systems which have no TeX
installed.  In that case, installers might like to have links in (say)
/usr/local/bin, so that users don't have to add the weird TL bin
directory to their PATH.

No doubt this could all be better documented.  I'll work on that
(although I'm doubtful as to whether that would have helped here).

The one dynamic-detection idea I can think of is that TL's install
should probably never replace a real file with one of these symlinks.
I'll see about that too.

As for recovery, uninstall/reinstall was a good idea.  Since it didn't
work, my only other thought is to look at an existing Debian system and
try to replicate what you see there.  In general, /usr/share/info should
contain the info files, and info and the other binaries should be in
/usr/bin.

One more thing:

    No `START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY' and no `This file documents'.
    install-info(/usr/share/info/info-stnd.info): unable to determine...

Has /usr/share/info/info-stnd.info become a symlink to a nonexistent
file, by any chance?  Any real info-stnd.info definitely should have a
START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY (I won't bore you with the explanation).  The
beginning of info-stnd.info should look approximately like this:

> This is info-stnd.info, produced by makeinfo version 4.7 from
> info-stnd.texi.
>

> * infokey: (info-stnd)Invoking infokey.    Compile Info customizations.
> END-INFO-DIR-ENTRY

Just to complicate things, Debian has their own version of install-info,
which is not the same as Texinfo's install-info.  (I've long wanted to
fix this ridiculous situation, but no luck so far.)  If problems
persist, you might want to open a bug report (= request for assistance,
in this case) with Debian.

Hope this helps a little more :).

Message-ID: <200408270103.i7R13iQ05189@f7.net>

    but did not follow it up then because it sounded somewhat too much in
    flux and neither sufficient documentation nor source were available

Omega (both source and binaries) have been included in TeX Live
(tug.org/texlive) for some years now.  How usable it is straight out of
the distribution is another matter.  (I have no experience with it.)

    Never heard of e-tex. 

It is a relatively conservative extension of tex done quite a few years
ago now, allowing for more registers (64k instead of 256), more tracing,
right-to-left typesetting, and other assorted nice (and uncontroversial,
as far as I know) features.  Version 2.2 will be released this year.

As of last year, the LaTeX team requested that etex be the default
engine for latex, and we made this so for TeX Live.

I think Robin answered most everything else.
(Robin: perhaps some of the above details would be worth including in
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=NTS.)

    But I was regularly finding outdated packages there, even

Indeed.  Linux distributions are notorious for having ancient versions
of TeX.  I do not understand their reasoning, but they are not amenable
to change, so ... we users lose.

    install-stnd.info in its subdirectory, which was probably unusable
    by info.

Only if the symlink was to a nonexistent file.  Oh, I suppose Debian
could have written their install-info to barf on symlinks, but I doubt it.

    Given all these problems, I'll probably return with teTeX
    [grunting], so at

TeX Live works fine on Debian.  Just don't try to install it (or any
symlinks :) in the system directories.  Let it live under /usr/local or
wherever.

    /usr/bin. Would deleting all sylinks to /usr/share/TeX (plus
    /usr/info and /usr/man), and reinstalling teTeX get me up and
    running faster than trying to replicate another (working) Debian?

I cannot say.  Sounds worth a try.

Hi, all.  i guess I'm a beginner to latex.  I scrounge around google to
find the answers i'm looking for, rather than doing what I can only assume
is an appropriate search.

I knows there's tons of documentation, and I know that much of it is
probably right here locally.  I just dont know how to get to it.

what i'm trying to do if mess with a letter, e.g., change the closing to
the right side, and things like that.  I'd also like to see some of the
different things that are available to me in this class.  I was lucky with
the exam class to find examdoc.tex, but only lucky.

so dont tell me what to do with my letter, but will someone tell me how to
find the right answer?

thanks,

bobby

Hi again,

Well that was enough to deter my attempts to switch to TeX-live! I didn't know 
TL and Debian were so incompatible.

I had, in fact, installed a Knoppix distribution without any (La)TeX system. I 
subsequently installed the Debian teTeX, and have been working with it for 
several months. But I was regularly finding outdated packages there, even 
though I always kept teTeX up to date. The caption package, for instance, is 
one that I remember right now; the entire 'labelsep' option to it is missing 
simply because Debian teTeX distributes an old version. TeX-live's packages 
seem to follow CTAN very closely. I also like to use texdotk for accessing 
the documentation, but teTeX's version has a bug that doesn't allow it to 
look up in a local tree for documentation (the author is aware of this and is 
working to fix that in the future). Because I like easy and efficient access 
to documentation, using updated packages, and saw that TeX-live's texdoctk 
works great, I thought I'd switch. Now I'm learning this is simply switching 
problems ;-)

I did uninstall teTeX first, so I had no TeX in my system at all before 
installing TeX-live. The instructions in the TeX-live manual don't say 
anything about the relationship between the symlinks option and setting the 
PATH variable (in /etc/profile, in my case, since I wanted that to be 
available to everybody). Some warning to the user regarding the symlinks 
option and its relationship to the PATH would be nice to those of us without 
deep knowledge of symlinks (I just know they're redirects :-)  ).

I looked at this and the problem was that TeX-live added a symlink to 
install-stnd.info in its subdirectory, which was probably unusable by info. 
Fortunately, it didn't obliterate my original, and deleting TeX-live's 
symlink restored everything.

Given all these problems, I'll probably return with teTeX [grunting], so at 
least no can of worms pop up later because of a messed-up /usr/bin. Would 
deleting all sylinks to /usr/share/TeX (plus /usr/info and /usr/man), and 
reinstalling teTeX get me up and running faster than trying to replicate 
another (working) Debian?

If you have texdoctk, (but see my previous post) you can access the 
documentation in an organized manner. You can also type texdoc <package or 
document-name>. Otherwise, there's always www.tug.org where you'll find a 
catalogue with organized entries too. Finally, plunge for a long dive into 
the texmf/doc directory both in the distribution's and your own tree.

If TeX-Live is still installed and info is now working then I'd stick
with that, personally.  I don't think there's likely to be a great lot
more wrong with your system that reinstalling teTeX would fix.

In future, as kb said, I'd stick to installing it under /usr/local
(and that goes for everything which doesn't come in a package targeted
to your distribution of Linux).  That's what the /usr/local hierarchy

Message-ID: <412FC10F.mailAV611CI0P@yew.ucsd.edu>


I am using tex-Live and have the following interesting situation
involving different page placement within the resulting .ps file depending on
the nature of the tex and dvips command scripts used to create the .ps file.

In the first case, I use both tex and dvips in the "ordinary manner" executing
commands from within the directory containing to be translated file; this seems to 
work fine.

In the second case, I use a script that changes directories into the 
directory and then executes the tex and dvips commands.   This appears to be broken.

The results differ considerably; in the first case pages are properly positioned on the
letter sized pages both according to gs as well as a postscript printer.  In the 
second case gs shows pages completely but slightly shrunk and "moved to the right" 
while the postscript printer bleeds off the top of sheets.   

The pages are to be presented with "landscape" orientation.

Both approaches previously gave identical good results.  
The difference now is that I am writing page number and chapter names to separate files. 
The page numbers and the chapter titles are written evidently as desired.  I am also
printing a page number at the bottom of the "portrait" version of the page.

One very interesting aspect of this is that the resulting ps files have very different
layouts.  Also the dvi files seem to differ in more than the creation time!

Any insights would be appreciated.    

Many thanks in advance.

What directory are you changing into?  Perhaps there are other styles or
packages which are changing the results in that directory, being read in
one case and not the other due to "." in the search paths.

If that's not it, I advise comparing the .log files in the two cases for
clues.

Happy hunting,

Can anybody help manage Chinese-typing with plain TeX?
What packages, and how to use them?
I downloaded from Ctan the entire directory 'tex-archive/language/chinese/',
and there seem to be many different routines.
What is the best one, and how to install it and to make it work?

Many thanks in advance for any insight,
						Rodolfo

P.S.: If this is not the suitable place for this question,
can anybody please point a right one.

  ChiTeX can be used in Plain TeX and LaTeX both Traditional and
  Simplified Chinese, but the CTAN has an old version. Maybe you
  can try here,

Many thanks, I visited the directory

ftp://ftp.math.ncu.edu.tw/chitex/unix/6.1.2p12lc/,

which is enormous and practically impossible to download entirely.
I imagine not all the files of this directory are necessary for my purposes.
On my PC I have Linux Mandrake, version 9.1.
Maybe could you point the files that are needed?

Thanks indeed,
		Rodolfo

  Ths whole directory about 190MB. I'm afraid get the whole
  directory will be conveniet, otherwise you need modify
  the setup sh script.

  wget -m ftp://ftp.math.ncu.edu.tw/chitex/unix/6.1.2p12lc/

  then get into the 6.1.2p12lc directory,

  ./setup

  If you have any trouble feel free to contact with professor
  Hung-Yih Chen <yih@math.ncu.edu.tw>.



Rgds,
Edward

Hi,

if I understand well, XymTeX is only for LaTeX and not for plain TeX.
Is that right? 
Does there exist any package 
for creating chemical structural diagrams in plain TeX format?

Thanks.
Cheers,
	Rodolfo

If there is such a thing Rodolfo you do not want to use it unless you
are just writing the occasional ultra-simple chemical structure ...
the same stricture applies to LaTeX ... use a modern professional  tool
such as the freeware Isis/Draw and import the structures via a
graphics file.

As the subject line indicates, please point me in the general direction where I can locate instructions on how to do that.

I'm running Windows XP and I've got a copy of Leslie Lamport's "LaTeX: A Document Preparation System." Maybe I should ask: "Do Windows files like Word(r) and Excel(r) integrate easily with LaTeX? What about graphs from other applications like Origin(r) and Igor(r)? Can these be put into my LaTeX documents relatively easily or is it painful?

Thanks.
