There is at least a package called nicefrac.sty on CTAN.  But someone
said that there is something better.  Unfortunately I don't remember
it's name.

That would probably be xfrac, which is a so-called experimental 
package.  Can be gotten from CTAN under
	macros/latex/exptl/
One also needs to obtain some latex3 experimental code, namely xbase, 
from
	http://www.latex-project.org/code/experimental/

The ? character doesn't exist in the T1 encoding.  But no matter: if you
include \usepackage{textcomp} then the ? (\textonehalf) symbol will be
typeset in the TS1 encoding where available.

Subject: [texhax] titlecase?
Message-ID: <1102187123.2239.7.camel@fred.local>

Is there a command/package somewhere to capitlise the first letter of
every word (and/or up-capitalise all but the 1st word)? I.e. a
\MakeTitlecase or \MakeSentencecase?

I realise this is frought with difficulties (see the FAQ, which points
to textcase.sty). But we're editing a book with inputs from lots of
authors. While Part and Chapter headings get turned into uppercase,
which is fine, the section and below headings (a) shouldn't be uppercase
and (b) should consistently be either titlecase (This Is A Section
Heading) or sentence case (This is a section heading). But there doesn't
seem to be a (la)tex command to do this, unless I've missed it
somewhere.

At present, the various authors have not been consistent in the way they
have written the subheadings, and it would be simplest and best if this
could be done by redefining \section rather than running 'round loops
editing files.

Thanks
Steve

This is actually a problem with a PDF viewer, not with
hyperref package.  I think acroread for GNU/Linux (at least
version 5.0) does not support Cyrillic at all, but xpdf is
supposed to, although I failed when some time ago I tried to
make it display Cyrillic bookmarks.  If you have access to
an installation of acroread on MS Windows you can try and
open your PDF document there, it should display the Cyrillic
correctly.

By the way, you may get more feedback on your posts related
to Cyrillic and Russian if you post to CyrTeX-ru mailing
list, check out

which book?

anyway, \usepackage{textcomp} followed by \textcopyright might provide
a reasonable guess of \texttrademark...and it would be right.

i don't much care for the look of it, myself, and might be tempted to
use

  \textsuperscript{TM}

or possibly

  \textsuperscript{\textsc{tm}}

Page 5 of

...\texmf\doc\guides\symbols\symbols-a4.pdf

tells you that \texttrademark and \textregistered (I'm not sure which one
you actually want) are LaTeX2e predefined text-mode commands.

Subject: [texhax] pad/xagaramon.sty
Message-ID: <41B4D6A0.1020903@raggmunk.nu>

I installed Walter Schmidt's Adobe AGaramond package (pad) from CTAN and 
installed the Adobe fonts accordingly. The pad.map file name the fonts 
with 8a and 8x encoding, but the xagaramon.sty and .fd-files refer to 
them with 9e encoding - thus LaTeX can't find the fonts.

This is not mentioned in the installation instructions (pad.txt). Have I 
missed something? Do I manually have to recode the font files to match 
the 9e encoding, or do the xagaramon.sty-file need a patch?

I should mention that i use teTeX on a system where I have no 
administrator privileges; thus I have installed everything in a local 
~/texmf directory and set the TEXMF environment variable accordingly 
(works perfect for other packages). I have successfully installed the 
Adobe AGaramond fonts on a system with MikTeX, so I know the fonts 
should work.

xpdf fails for me too.

I did the check on Windows with Acrobat Reader version 6.0 and it
worked. This calms me a little bit, because people will be able to see
the bookmarks in my documents.

    Does anyone have any suggestions for other TeX lists?  Preferably

There are zillions of TeX lists on particular topics, of course
(http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/ has the ones hosted on tug, but there
are lots of others), but I can't think of any "general" advanced lists.

As many long-time texhax members will recall, that is in fact (de facto)
what texhax used to be.  After many years of activity, it somehow
dwindled away and became moribund.

When texhax was moved to tug.org, we thought it would make sense to
combine it with support@tug.org, so that instead of having two large
lists for general questions and discussion, there would be only one --
since there was hardly any "advanced" traffic coming into texhax, the
distinction seemed to have been lost.

If there is a consensus that a "high level" list would be useful once
again, we're happy to create/host it, of course.  I'm not sure about it
myself ...

back when texhax was a digest-only list, it really didn't much help
people who were stuck.  the uktex list went some way in addressing the
problem, by having a group of suckers^w dedicated people who would
immediately answer, so that both question and answer appeared in the
digest.

both lists were on the wane at the time uk tug took over texhax and
merged them (and at that time there were no volunteers to provide the
"quick answers").  in fact, comp.text.tex was taking most of the
traffic, and it has remained a moderate-volume newsgroup.

i find it interesting that texhax's role as a vibrant list has revived
so quickly, with its new "non-digested" capability.

this despite the ready availability of comp.text.tex first via deja-
news and now via google groups.

me neither.  there's been a steady stream of proposals for splitting
comp.text.tex, from people who don't like the constant chatter.  they
always fail, because no-one dares dilute the expert attention.  i fear
that splitting texhax suffers from the same possible problem.

Dear Sir, Madame,

I did not find any useful information on my problem explained below on

Thanks for your help!
Tamas

=======
I would like to create figures with images and text, convert it to eps, 
and use in latex (os linux).

If I create the figure e.g. in oodraw, export it to eps, create dvi, pdf:
-> print out of pdf is pretty fine;
-> on-screen pdf is ugly.

I tried different programs to do this well. Only XFig was able to create 
  high quality eps for both printer and screen, but for creating some 
type of figures XFig is not a good solution.

What I miss? What other 'high quality eps' program can you advice?

Agreed. The one thing I want to mention here is that (arguably) some 
(maybe only a small percentage?) of the high-level discussion / 
development has gone off to Context, which has at least one list 
dedicated to it which I've been meaning to look into.

That's probably not going to happen until someone comes up with a 
LaTeX-compatibility module for ConTeXt.

Or, someone comes up with a better, more concise, human-authorable 
document-markup language / scheme than LaTeX.

I will mention in passing that the LaTeX list has been mighty quiet of 
late, but has seen some fairly high-level discussion in the past, so 
seems the best place to my mind to discuss package development if one 
wants a list instead of comp.text.tex.

Things I'd suggest looking up:

  - skencil
  - inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org)
  - dia
  - cenon (http://www.cenon.info)

The latter is the most interesting to my mind, esp. if you're using Mac 
OS X.

Subject: [texhax] BiBTeX question (natbib)
Message-ID: <s1b5c28b.064@MAIL.NDRI.ORG>

Hello

I am using fpTeX on a Windows machine.

In my preamble I have \usepackage{natbib}
in my text, I have, e.g. 
        It requires the same sort of data as GLM,
        and offers the same sort of results, but relaxes the
        assumption of independence  \citep{raudenbush02,
        verbeke00}.

near the end of my text I have \bibliographystyle{agsm}

I then run PDFLaTeX on this file, the bibtex on the .aux file, then
PDFLaTeX on the .tex file twice more,
But, instead of the above giving me something like
(Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Verbeke and Molenberghs, 2000)
it gives me (13, 17).
And some cites give me (author?)
when I am sure that the cite is in the .bib file.


Any hints?

Thanks

A first off-the-top-of-my-head reply is that if natbib cannot order your
cites (say because one of them doesn't have a year or an author---typos?),
then it falls back on ordinary sequential numbering.

If that doesn't help then we need a _minimal_ example.

Oh, just one thought: and if you use LaTeX instead of pdfLaTeX?

Thank you Philip, for your reply 

The problem is solved - at least partially.

When I use LaTeX instead of pdfLaTeX, it worked correctly.  Oddly,
though, when I tried pdfLaTeX after using LaTeX, that also worked
correctly.....

anyway, it's working, so thanks

I'm using BibTeX with Plain TeX (under Linux). I'd like to be able to

the normal (ex natbib) syntax is just \cite[page foo]{bar1947}

you don't say what macros you're using for citations: for some reason
i thought the eplain macros implemented much the same syntax as the
"normal" latex macros.  have you actually tried?

The problem has resolved itself: for some reason, I thought the page 
number syntax would only work if if one were using natbib, using \citet 
or similar, and completely missed the possibility of using page numbers 
with plain old \cite. Obviously, I ought to have gone to bed hours ago 
(it's 3AM here). :-)

Message-ID: <20041208231324.29389.qmail@web41904.mail.yahoo.com>

i have a weird citation issue that doesn't seem to be
documented in the natbib docs.

i am trying to cite two references using the
\cite{ref29,ref33} form. one of the references is a
conference paper specifically on the topic in
question, but the other is a textbook that has a
one-page table i need to cite. in other words, it's
specific enough that i need to cite the specific page,
not just the whole book.

ideally, the reference would render in LaTeX as [29;
33, p. 659], but the form \cite[p. 659]{ref29,ref33}
doesn't handle this correctly -- instead it spits out
[29, 33, p. 659].

can anyone suggest a simple way to do this?

TIA,

HJ

The natbib package version 2000/07/24 7.0a has a default behaviour of round
parenthesis and semicolon separators - so you have presumably already
altered this.

Anyway, \usepackage[square,colon]{natbib} should set the behaviour you want.

If you wish to temporarily turn on semicolon separators (e.g., for such
cases), then you will need something like

\makeatletter
\newcommand\setcolons{\renewcommand\NAT@sep{;}}
\newcommand\setcommas{\renewcommand\NAT@sep{,}}
\makeatother

in the preamble, which will allow

... \setcolons \cite[p. 659]{ref29,ref33} \setcommas ...

Alternatively, use the various \citealt, \citealp, \citeyear, etc forms
(more than once if necessary) and construct exactly what you want. See
natnotes documentation for natbib (Google natbib will get you a copy).

Good morning! -- This is Robert Rogers hailing.

How does one change the font displayed by default in math mode?
That is, text bracketed by dollar signs?  For example, $x^{2}$?

I am wondering if there is a generic macro
or perhaps a command kin to 

\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{ppm}

where one can reassign the underlying default.
Is that default \mathfam or something of that nature?

Thanks for your help! -- Robert

the reason for restrictions in file access within tex are that _tex_
can in principle be made to write to any file.

the reason for restrictions on the use of the write18 facility are
obvious.

a postscript file talks to a programmable interpreter: any such file
can therefore perform a denial-of-service attack, at the least.  if
the interpreter is ghostscript (or similar), there is in principle the
possibility of more serious destruction: which is why there are
security controls within ghostscript.

i'm not really au fait with widnoze implementations (and i've never
used a mac); there may be other issues that those versions of tex have
to deal with.

... and these are just my selection the ones people have thought of so
far.  there may be others i don't know about.

Hello,

I'm using the default tetex install on Debian Sarge.  I'm attempting to 
print using the LaTeX book style, using the twoside option.   The final 
printout has the binding margin on the wrong side -- on the page-number 
side.  The PDF and DVI both exhibit the same margins.  I'm guessing this 
is something simple I'm overlooking; any suggestions would be appreciated.

Times - \usepackage{mathptmx}
Palatino - \usepackage{mathpazo}

There're also commercial fonts, or hacks like the package sansmath from 
CTAN.

If you search on those terms you should get a hit for say the FAQ or 
other listing of math fonts.

hello...

my name is Alexander Frank, math graduate student

I've installed the musixtex package following the instructions from the 
warner icking page (the oficial site).... and I added a few executables
files to the miktex/bin directory...

I work with WinEdt on Windows XP and it seems that this program doesn't
know about the existence of musixflx.exe (located in miktex/bin directory)
because the output of the files that I create are not influenciated by
this file. Perhaps I have to configurate something in WinEdt, but I'm
lost.... I've been looking through apparently all the menues and files to
configurate... and nothing.... also I've included in the miktex/bin
directory some preprocessor executables and I don't know how to call them
from WinEdt (pmxab.exe, mtx.exe).

(I've refreshed the miktex database.... also I've looked for executables
with an option into WinEdt and only appears the basic executables...
tex.exe.... latex.exe... yap.exe... etc. I've looked into WinEdtex.ini,

Dear Tug,

Since \marginpar works only for \twocolumn, i need an alternate method

Is there a way to print marginal notes in multicols environment. Please 
advice.

Thanks in advance,

use longtable instead of the combination of table + tabular.

Remember to the the doc for longtable

LaTeX is a great solution for that!

I don't know the answer to that, but if you can at all afford to get
him to OSX you will do an enormous service to his education.  The
difference is night to day.  I am very happy that I switched at home,
good riddence to OS 9!!   OSX is a modern Unix operating system
(secure and stable, no viruses).  He can get a huge ton of open source
(aside from latex, which is a great idea).  Start by getting fink

http://fink.sourceforge.net/

some useful programs you can get with fink:

wget
xv
imagemagick

It may also be possible to put Linux on the machine he has, in which
case it may cost very little.  (I don't have experience with that
though.)

He should learn to do these things, downloading is a modern method. 
Fink makes much of the work easier.  I didn't see that one could set
up LaTeX with fink, but if someone did that it would be an incredible
service to Mac users everywhere!

If moving to OS X isn't an option you'll need to use one of the 
shareware or commercial TeX implementations for the Mac.

Here's a good reference site to learn about that sort of thing:

http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/default9.html

But that's not being up-dated and it's very behind the times as it were.

Another alternative would be to get Linux for your Mac if it's 
compatible with one of the distributions, that'd come with Linux and 
you'd be able to install TeXlive.

Moving to Mac OS X would be far preferrable though, in which case I'd 
suggest you get:

TeXshop - http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html
Gerben Wierda's i-installer (link to it from the above page)
XeTeX - http://scripts.sil.org/xetex
Will Robertson's Fontspec -

     I'm not sure how WinEdt comes into all of this, but when using 
MusixTeX
     on a Linux box, you need to run

     tex mypiece
     musixflx mypiece.mx1
     tex mypiece

     that is, YOU need to run musixflx, and then tex your file again. 
Try that !

Hello,

Does anyone know of the convention, commonly used in the field of 
history(?), to mark recurring text passages with three 'x's aligned 
vertically on top of each other. It's supposed to look something like 
the following, only that the three 'x's should fit into one line.

x                    x      
x  text to be marked x
x                    x

Is there a symbol for it in Latex or a package that provides it, and how 
can I get it? Or failing that, how can I create my own symbol for it?

Many thanks in advance,

Sarah Bluhme

Hi, all,

A question about spacing in \tableofcontents: I would like to decrease 
the vertical space between lines in the table.  A session with the 
Companion (2Ed) and the FAQ haven't helped (although I could be 
overlooking something).  Is there a (simple?) way to do this?

Thanks for your help, as always.

It didn't, but it does :-}.  I'd already looked at this (among others). 
  I didn't see anything directly relating to my problem, so I kept 
looking.

Prompted by your reply, I looked again, and then looked at the doc for 
tocloft.  While this seemed overly complicated, I decided to try it.  
I'm happy to report that just "using" this package suffices to clean up 
the TOC.

Thanks for the help.

Justin

you want us to do your google groups search for you, because you can't
be bothered to tell us what the preamble of your document contains.

do try google groups: i remembered answering in a thread where this
issue occurred, and there's an answer there.

or post the preamble of your document so someone can spot the answer
immediately.

You could try this:

\newcommand{\recur}{\hbox to 1ex{\hbox to0pt{\raisebox{0.7ex}{x}}%
\hbox to0pt{\raisebox{-0.5ex}{x}}%
\hbox to0pt{\raisebox{0.1ex}{x}}}}

Probably there's a tidier way, but this answers part of your request.
I also imagine someone else here can explain why the % signs are
necessary, but they are.

Have you tried LilyPond (http://www.lilypond.org/)?  I've
never used musixtex so I can't compare, but I've heard
several times (from people who tried both) advices against
musixtex in favor of LilyPond.

The % signs are necessary because after `}' in horizontal
mode TeX is in mid-line mode where it converts the
end-of-line character to a token for character 32 (` ') of
category 10 (space).  After that it enters state S (skipping
blanks) and ignores any further end-of-lines. (See The
TeXbook, p. 47.)

I suppose it depends on what you want to do with it: I use musixtex 
mainly for typesetting musical examples in papers, for which it is 
exceedingly convenient, since I can just keep typing, and for 
typesetting styles of notation that aren't available in mainstream music 
notation software (such as Old German organ tablature, which has an 
exceedingly small audience). The results are very beautiful, and (for 
me) take less time than fighting with importing some foreign format. If 
I were wanting to typeset large, normal-looking scores in a hurry, I'd 
probably go for Lilypond, partly because Rosegarden exports to it (it 
used to export to musictex, did it not?? I only just started using it), 
and my MIDI keyboard likes Rosegarden. What sort of music are you 
wanting to typeset?

not quite.

in state "s", a further end of line character is converted to a \par
token, and things start again.

There are two or three problems with the above:

1. It leads to three aligned vertically BUT overlapping x's, which I think
is not what the poster intended;
2. The length "ex" is not the width but height of the lower-case letter x
(which, depending on the font, may or may not coincide with its width - in
this case it doesn't).  In fact, it is redundant here.
3. The use of \hbox to0pt with no shrinkable glue (\hss) inside leads to
annoying overfull \hbox warnings, use \makebox[0pt][l]{...} instead.

I believe the following might be more in line with what the poster requested
(although the x's still appear a little large):

\newcommand{\recur}{%
  \raisebox{-0.8ex}{%
    \small
    \makebox[0pt][l]{\raisebox{2.4ex}{x}}%
    \makebox[0pt][l]{\raisebox{1.2ex}{x}}%
    x%
  }%
}

However, if, as I suspect, they are not really supposed to be x's but
crosses, then try substituting the letter x with $\times$ and fiddling with
the size and spacing, thus:

\newcommand{\recur}{%
  \raisebox{-0.5ex}{%
    \tiny
    \makebox[0pt][l]{\raisebox{3.6ex}{$\times$}}%
    \makebox[0pt][l]{\raisebox{1.8ex}{$\times$}}%
    $\times$%
  }%
}

A last, perhaps neater, solution is:

\newcommand{\recur}{%
  \raisebox{0.4ex}{%
    \tiny
    \arraycolsep0pt
    \def\arraystretch{0}%
    $\begin{array}{c}\times\\\times\\\times\end{array}$%
  }%
}

To be safer, one should really use \smaller or \mathsmaller from the
'relsize' package.

Hi Tom,

thanks for your help - I modified your code slightly to make the 'x's 
smaller and it looks fine for my purposes

\newcommand{\recur}{\hbox to 1ex{\hbox to0pt{\raisebox{0.9ex}{\sffamily 
\tiny x}}%
\hbox to0pt{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{\sffamily \tiny x}}%
\hbox to0pt{\raisebox{0.3ex}{\sffamily \tiny x}}}}


There's just one strange bug: a blank line preceding a \recur starts a 
new paragraph after the triple 'x' sign.
Has anyone got any ideas as to the cause of this phenomenon?

Many thanks,

Sarah

It's something I've come across before but always been too lazy to fully
understand: it's something to do with LaTeX's handling of \hbox's.  Anyway,
none of the suggestions I made in the previous posting has this problem.

not latex, tex.  if you're in vertical mode, an \hbox is added, on its
own, to the vertical list, and you stay in vertical mode.  any
following text will then start a new paragraph in the ordinary way.

latex box "\hbox" commands (like \mbox, \framebox and so on) all emit
\leavevmode to avoid this slightly startling behaviour.  which doesn't
stop pretty much *anyone* from slipping "bare" \hbox on to innocent
users from time to time.  (i've done it myself.)

    It's something I've come across before but always been too lazy to fully
    understand: it's something to do with LaTeX's handling of \hbox's.  Anyway,
    none of the suggestions I made in the previous posting has this problem.
    
    Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

a blank line is a signal for a new paragraph.  always.
(in the absence of tricky code to make it behave otherwise.)

the paragraph break puts one into vertical mode.
when the first thing in vertical mode is an \hbox, tex
stays in vertical mode, hence the paragraph break after
\recur.

try putting \leavevmode before the first \hbox.

this will *usually* "do the right thing".  that is, it
will put you into horizontal (paragraph text) mode after
a paragraph break, but there may be some obscure situations
when it might do something unexpected elsewhere.

There are good reasons why one should use the LaTeX command \makebox  
instead of the TeX primitive \hbox. You see, \hbox has a mildly deceiving  
name. While it typesets it's argument in horizontal mode it may in fact  
appear in vertical mode. Since TeX is in vertical mode at the beginning of  
the paragraph, the \hbox in \recur will also be in vertical mode unless  
you tell it to leave vertical mode. This can be done with the command  
\leavevmode, but I'd much rather instruct you to use the LaTeX constructs  
in order to avoid those problems once and for all.

Might I propose a definition like this:

\newsavebox\recurbox
\sbox\recurbox{\sffamily\tiny x}
\sbox\recurbox{%
   \raisebox{-.5\ht\recurbox}{\usebox\recurbox}%
   \makebox[0pt][r]{\raisebox{.5\ht\recurbox}{\usebox\recurbox}}%
   \makebox[0pt][r]{\raisebox{1.5\ht\recurbox}{\usebox\recurbox}}%
}
\newcommand*\recur{\usebox\recurbox}

Box objects like this are useful in situations where you need the exact  
same object multiple times as seems to be the case here.

As far as I know, there is no apalike package as such but the file
apalike.bst (which is what you want) is part of the MiKTeX base
installation: you should find it in
...\texmf\bibtex\bst\base

would the owner of the address

please update his or hers address in the texhax mailing list.

I keep getting the same message from

  postmaster at di.uminho.pt

about the replacement of this address.

I asume other posters on this mailing list has the same problem.

The main problem is that in order to contact jmv one needs his or hers 
last name, but I have no idea how jmv is.

Message-ID: <38E82082-5319-11D9-8B60-00306544D642@mac.com>

Hi, all,

A question re: \labelformat.  The companion (2E) sez this comes from 
the package varioref, but I get 'undefined' errors when I reference it, 
after \usepackage{varioref} (and the varioref doc is silent on the 
subject).

A footnote (in addition to the FAQ) mentions that it is available in 
Robin's fncylab package, and that works, so I'm just curious: is this a 
mistake, or am I lost in the maze of twisty passages?

Regards,

Justin

I don't really understand your requirement but see whether

    $\underset{\tilde{}}{\text{word}}$

or   
   
    $\underset{\widetilde{\hphantom{\text{word}}}}{\text{word}}$

helps. You'll have to use the "amsmath" package for "\underset" to work

I've tried Tex2Word (Chikrii), but it doesn't seem to work on

a bike rider writes: downgrade? -- the limousine is clumsy and hard to
manage, and is a heavy consumer of limited world resources.  whereas a
bike is manoeuverable, easy to park, and consumes little but body fat
(though, admittedly, not _enough_ body fat...).

no.  i think you have your metaphor upside-down.

Actually, there are.  Here's two: 
1) Your boss insists on a Word file that he can edit, and doesn't want
to learn LaTeX

2) A journal you are submitting to insists on a .doc file

Both of these apply to me.

Dear Greg,

As far as I know, TeX2Word is the only and actually a very useful
utility if one needs to get an editable Microsoft-native file from a
LaTeX file. It really converts LaTeX equations into MathType ones and
the overall result looks quite reasonable.

TeX and Word are very different systems created with different users
and aims in mind. Generally, a TeX file cannot be converted into MS
Word format correctly. Just like one cannot accurately convert between
GIF and JPEG. 

The main drawback of the T2W is that it uses the built-in TeX
compiler rather than the compiler you have installed on your system.
This means, that it can only understand the commands it supports. The
worst news for me personally is that it cannot convert files with
amsmath commands which I use extensively. Thus if I need to convert a
text into Word I have to make it as simple as possible beforehand.

Regards,
Konstantin.

Peter,

You have my sympathies (really)...

You MIGHT try to cheat and use latex2html to convert your document into
an html one, and then try to open that in Word. The equations will all
be images, I think but at least they'll be there.

Alternatively, generate a pdf file using pdflatex (or dvipdf or
whatever) and buy your boss a full version of acrobat so s/he can edit
the pdf. They'll probably like this even less.

None of these are great options, but the real problem is that the
underlying paradigms don't match, so translation in either direction is
NEVER going to be 100% satisfactory.

Steve

Would conversion to rtf (Rich Text Format) suffice?  MS Word can read 
and edit RTF files.  I think there are a couple latex-to-rtf converters.

Use latex2rtf, it gets you most of the way there.

Message-ID: <1833736046.20041223085335@econ.usyd.edu.au>

The thread on this topic touches a nerve, since I find myself in this
dilemma quite often. I use LaTeX all the time, but have colleagues who
only work with Word, as well as publishers etc who require Word
versions of chapters or articles etc.

I've tried several of the methods mentioned, and the best one I have
found is to generate a PDF file (eg pdflatex) and then convert the PDF
file into a Word file. I've tried several commercial packages for
this, and the best results have come from the cheapest one, Scansoft's
PDF converter (http://www.scansoft.com/pdfconverter/) Mine came
bundled with some other software (Dragon Naturally Speaking), but the
website indicates the current pricing is around $100.

The conversion process works inside Word. You open the PDF document
from inside the Word and the scansoft softward launches converts it as
it opens it.

The results are somewhat mixed:

* very successful for formatted text (headings, quotes,
footnotes, headers, footers etc)

* moderately good for tables (respects most cells, except doesn't span
full columns when using \multicolumn, only the numbers of columns
which the width of the text covers). Still, this is much better on
tables than most of other approaches.

* good at preserving whatever graphics may be embedded in your PDF
(though the quality falls away because they become bitmapped)

* poor for tables of contents etc. (seems to have problems with the
spacing for page numbers), but this is intermittent

* lousy at equations (doesn't convert to a graphic, but gives
a mixture of meaningful and meaningless text)


Still, this is the best approach I have found yet, but I'd be
interested to hear about other people's experiences.

well if my english was better, I surely would be able to use more 
complex and better metaphors... But you are absolutely right:
There might be reasons using a world file but they are not 
quality-oriented and that is what I don't like about the idea.
Have you ever made formulas with MS Formula editor? They are ugly, 
believe me. If beautiful documents are the reason for using LaTeX, it is 
curios to use latex and then make an ugly word file out of it.

BUT: I'd also use latex2html, copy the generated images and make the 
rest with abiword or something like that. Maybe you find out how 
latex2html generates these images and can do that whithout the whole 
stuff around it.

I'm sorry for starting a discussion which was not very helpfull for the 
submitter of the original question.

MS Equation Editor is out of question for scientific papers. TeX2Word
requires MathType (free of charge). And MathType produces very nice
equations, though it is not nearly as powerful in formatting multiple
equations as LaTeX (of course :)). A bit worse look inline equations,
but that's the problem of Word, not MathType. Also, unlike LaTeX,
MathType has limited functionality, so there may occur equations not
reproducible with MathType.

But really, MathType is good for people who are unlucky as I am and
are forced to use MS Word for their papers sometimes. I'd recommend
learning it if that's the case.

As far as I understand, the problem is that a text is already prepared
with LaTeX and one needs to read and edit it without LaTeX. If this is
the case, neither PDF->Word nor LaTeX2HTML converters will do. Because
they lead to non-editable equations. 

So far, I see no good solution to the problem, and T2W looks the most
reasonable one.

Happy *TeXing*!
Konstantin.


P.S. It would be great if LaTeX2HTML was made to produce
markup-language-based (i.e., editable) rather than graphical
equations. That would be a solution, but I am not a programmer and I
wonder if it is possible at all.

I'd like to thank all the people who wrote on this topic; it has been
very informative for me.

I've tried out some of the suggestions:
Tex2Word seems pretty good, if you don't use AMS math symbols. 
Unfortunately, I sometimes do use them.  It also costs money

Failing that, converting to an html file seems best, both by majority
vote and my own brief experimentation.

One option I haven't seen mentioned is Scientific Workplace, which I
see advertised in some statistics journals.  Has anyone experience with
it?


Happy holidays

I have a collaborator who swears by Scientific Workplace. It generates 
reasonable LaTeX. I don't think it involves Word. If you can get your Word 
using people to switch to Scientific Workplace, everyone will be happy.

I have not actually used Scientific Workplace, or its cheaper cousin 
Scientific Word, myself.

I have never done it and I hope never to have to, but there is a quite 
interesting and detailed article in the TugBoat I got last week (I think 
it was actually dated 2003, but it just came out) on the subject.  The 
author was dealing with a publisher who would take nothing but Word and 
who owned the copyright for the original edition, so changing publishers 
was not an option.  (So there are perfectly valid reasons for wanting to 
do this.)

Basically, he used something called VTeX (a commercial program) to go from 
LaTeX source to HTML and then used Word to import the latter.  He did not 
that he had no mathematics in his 755 page ms, however.  

I think if I were faced with this problem I would give the publisher a 
printout and invite him to typeset it.

Since "theorem like" statements often require special typestting, it maybe
metter to use the "\newtheorm" command rather than using the generic
"\newenvironment".  To me, the best option seems to be the "amsthm"
package, which allows infinite (well, almost) variations of typesetting
theorems. This is explained in the new (second) edition of the LaTeX
Companion. The LaTeX Primer by TuGIndia also has a chapter on this
package. It is available at

             www.sarovar.org

I haven't been in this situation in a while, and for the second case, 
you can
get stuck.  For the first, a work-around - which involves more work for 
you! -
is to offer to do all the edits from your colleague's markup.  They can 
go the
traditional route of red pencil on paper, or use a PDF with a program 
that lets them insert notes.  (I've tried the latter in the converse 
position, when I had to comment on books being produced in Framemaker.  
I found it to be much more work than the traditional red pencil, and 
soon went back to that.)

If all they want is a graphical front-end, why not try LyX?

There's a Win32 QT version which pretty much works / looks like a 
native Windows app.

There's a QT port for Mac OS X too, so everyone ought to be happy.

    * how can I use OpenType/TrueType font as the URW fonts?

I'm not sure which URW fonts you mean.  The URW fonts that have been
released freely are available in Type 1 format and have TeX support
already on CTAN (fonts/psfonts).

Mostly, to use OpenType or TrueType you have to convert them into Type 1
first, and chop them up into 256-char-max fonts.  There are several
utilities around for this.  Here are a couple of links:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=psfchoice
http://www.radamir.com/tex/ttf-tex.htm
http://ipe.compgeom.org/pdftex.html

Some commercial TeX implementations support TrueType directly, e.g.,
http://truetype.com.

The MacOSX-specific XeTeX supports OpenType through the OS.
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=xetex

There are a number of development projects for directly supporting
OpenType in standard TeX or Omega, including in pdftex, but I don't
think any have reached fruition.  There are recent TUGboat articles on
the topic.  http://tug.org/TUGboat/

    * what the OMEGA is?

Omega is a TeX extension based on Unicode, allowing 16-bit input.  Thus
it (or a relative) is the most reasonable basis for future OpenType
support.
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=omega

    * and is there any alternative than OMEGA?

A related project named Aleph combines omega with the etex
extensions and pdftex output.
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=aleph

Perhaps I should mention that enctex (integrated with web2c and included
in the TL 2004 release) supports true UTF-8 input.  Doesn't have
OpenType support, though.
http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html
http://trific.ath.cx/tex-mf/enctex/

There is nothing else released that I know of.

Sorry there is not better news.  We all wish TeX had real support for
OpenType, but it's not a trivial job, obviously, or it would have been
done long ago.  Perhaps others can fill in more details or mention other
projects.

Thank you, Karl, for providing this link.

I suppose that most people on this list know what software patents
mean for free software.

Commercial software is affected as well.  Software patents are
probably the death for many small companies which cannot afford the
license fees.

But there is another point:  Software devolpment is a great chance for
developing countries.  For software development you do not need much
money but knowledge.  And people in many developing countries have
this knowledge.  And the knowledge is all they have...

\LaTeX is defined in latex distributions, as is \LaTeXe; this is
because it's difficult to do well[*].  latex also provides a definition of
\TeX, which is (iirc) slightly different from that in plain tex.

bibtex is easy to do with the tex logo, and is only provided in
packages that believe there's value in massive overload of these silly
logos.  my tugboat macros define it, for example; not because i
believe in the logos, but because the editor does.

[*] the latex logo is painfully font-dependent.  i wrote a package to
permit parametric definition of the logo based on features of the
font.  it's not terribly successful, but i did get a tugboat paper out
of that little bit of silliness.

	limits of \int^{}_{}
Message-ID: <1104119759.41cf87cfd5774@webmail.mit.edu>

Hello,

I am having trouble printing a pdf file generated with latex + dvi2pdf (from
Winedt?s dvi2pdf.edt I can see the pdf is produced with dvipdfm.bat). I would
very much appreciate any help on the matter.

The problem:

I write \int_{\widetilde{A}}^{\widetilde{A}}, then I do latex  + dvi2pdf, and
the pdf file on screen looks ok. I print the file and Acrobat gives me the
following message ?An error occurred while downloading a font. This document
might not print correctly.? The printout is a page with no \widehat nor
\widetilde in the limits of the integral (the hat and the tilde disappear from
the limits of the integral and it looks like \int_{A}^{A}). This does not
happened if the \widetilde{A} or \widehat{A} is outside the limits of the
integral. Here is the exact code:

\documentclass[letterpaper, 12pt]{article}
\usepackage{calc} 
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\oddsidemargin .24in \topmargin .1in \headheight 0pt \headsep 0pt
\textwidth 6in \textheight 9in \footskip .65in \parskip .2in

\begin{document}

Hola $\widehat{A} \widetilde{A}$ (This one is ok)
\begin{equation} \widetilde{A} \int_{\widetilde{A}}^{B}\end{equation} 
(the first $\widetilde{A}$ is ok, but the one in the lower limit of $\int$ only

shows an $A$ without the tide).

\end{document}

Please note the following:

1.- C:\localtexmf\miktex\config\updmap.cfg contains only the following lines:

  dvipsDownloadBase35 true
  pdftexDownloadBase14 true
  dvipdfmDownloadBase14 true

And I did initexfm ?u and  initexmf ?mkmaps after the changes (DOS).

2.- C:\texmf\web2c\updmap.cfg contains the line

dvipdfmDownloadBase14 true

3.- I also tried ?dvips, open GV and send to print? and it worked fine.
Similarly,  pdflatex works fine too. Due to unrelated issues, these two options
do not satisfy my needs and I would prefer to do latex + dvi2pdf instead (but I
still need to solve the issue discussed in this email).

4.- If I do the same example with \int_{A}^{B} there is no problem. 

5.- In case it could be useful, the resulting pdf file has the following fonts
 (from Doc Properties/Fonts):
 
 CMR12, CMEX10, CMMI12, CMMI8, cmex8  
 (they all say: Type 1, Built-in, Embedded Subset, Type 1)

Thank you very much for any help on how to solve this problem,

Herman

I tried your file, processing it with miktex using the winedt front end, 
and the printed result is just what you want, with the wide tilde over the 
A in the lower limit of the integral. This is not very helpful, I know, but 
that is my result.

Subject: [texhax] gv 3.6.1 released
Message-ID: <16848.39866.779175.454561@gargle.gargle.HOWL>



GNU gv 3.6.1 has been released today. It is available for download in
the GNU ftp, ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gv

Changes on this release:


# New set of command line arguments. This solves the horrid bug on
gv 3.6.0 that made such release nearly unusable. See the
documentation for details about the new argument list.

# The "Reopen" entry on the File menu has been renamed to "Reload" in
order to be coherent with the "Reload" button.

# The distributed package structure have been fixed, now conforming a
legal GNU source package.

# The delete key now work as expected, that is, it deletes the next
character rather the last character when typed on text entries.

# Dot files are not shown by default on file selection forms.

# If you try to open an empty file you get a coherent error
message.

# New manual page

* Most of the Debian patches has been applied to gv:

162830_scanf.diff (Fix a security risk involving buffer overflows)
167029_argv.diff (Fix an access beyond end of array on process.c)
206008_flicker.diff (Add double-buffering to pixmap operations)
223556_hidden_dir.diff (Do not show dot files on file listings)
250854_tmp_umask.diff (Tempfiles should not be created worldreadable)
252548_errno.diff (Wrong error message while opening empty files)
179643_bad_dsc.diff (Make DSC parsing case-insensitive)
159433_delete_key.diff (Change behaviour of Delete key on text entries)

* The gs command used for PDF to PostScript conversion has been fixed to allow
document saving.

Subject: [texhax] spaces at beginning of environment
Message-ID: <3cfdbff104122810005fe5a83@mail.gmail.com>

I wrote a simple macro for algorithms, that I use as

\begin{tabbing}
\begalg
% algorithm here
\end{tabbing}

To improve this, I defined the following:

\newenvironment{algenv}{\begin{tabbing}\begalg}{\end{tabbing}}

But now there is a space before the first line of the algorithm when I use

\begin{algenv}
%algorithm
\end{algenv}

Can you see what is generating this space, and how can I remove it?

Regards,
-Carlos

Hello again

I have a BibTeX entry

@BOOK{wang99,
   author = {{SAS Institute, Inc.} and Morgan C. Wang and Brad C.
Bushman},
   editor = {},
   title = {Integrating results through meta-analytic review using SAS

   number = {},
   series = {},
   address = {Cary, NC},
   edition = {},
   month = {},
}


when I typeset this, it comes out incorrectly.  The date is given as
n.d, and no publisher is listed.  

I've looked in the LaTeX companion and Math into LaTeX, and I can't
figure it out.  

TIA as always

Well, there is my hack which was just written up in the latest TUGboat 
can be used to access OpenType fonts as well (anything which InDesign 
can access or which one can make a nice .eps of w/ subsetted fonts 
which Acrobat Distiller can recompose into more compleat fontsets).

You need to use Omega (or Aleph) to get at the large character sets and 
one has to set up the .otp to mimic the layout tables and the .ofm for 
the font metrics pretty much by hand, but there's no real limit on what 
can be done --- just one's patience.

Presumably, you also got a BibTeX error of the type (it's in the .blg file):

Database file #5: xxxxx.bib
I was expecting a `,' or a `}'---line nn of file xxxxx.bib
 :
 :    publisher = {SAS Institute},
(Error may have been on previous line)
I'm skipping whatever remains of this entry

which points pretty well to the source of the problem: the previous line is

   title = {Integrating results through meta-analytic review using SAS
software}

and is missing a closing comma!

Message-ID: <658A2E50-58F9-11D9-9B4E-000D93493124@rumms.uni-mannheim.de>

Hi, I'd like to install TeX on my new iBook.
I already installed it on my old PowerBook, with no problems.

But since TeX was updated (on 12/26/04) I cannot install it an my iBook!

I start i-Installer version v2 (v2.69.0), than I open the i-Package TeX.
Then I click on install & configure, I choose <basic> and then <2004 
stable>.

Then I get the message <Package requires other files>

It looks like tex4ht has moved into the main TeX package, but the 
dependencies haven't been updated, or you've installed tex4ht and the 
new version wants a newer version or libmagick.

Install/update the libmagick package then try to install TeX again.

Best to ask this on the Mac OS X TeX mailing list if possible.

Thank you for your answer!

I just tried it again and there is an updated version of TeX on the 
server.
And I can install TeX straightforward with this version (...at least I 
am downloading TeX at the moment...).

\newcommand\foo{\@ifstar{\foos}{\foonos}}

then define \foos (stared version) and \foonos (unstared) as usual.

note that it \foo it to take say one argument then it's \foos and \foonos 
that has to take an argument not \foo

instead of RTFM -- try to look inside your favorite packages or clases

That particular one is pretty hairy!

This small example should perhaps make it a little clearer:
%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{minimal}
\makeatletter
\newcommand*\testa{%
   \@ifstar
     {Star version, two mandatory arguments:
      \testa@star}
     {No star, one mandatory and one optional argument:
      \testa@nostar}%
}

\newcommand*\testa@star[2]{%
   Arg~1:~``#1'', arg~2:~``#2''.%
}
\newcommand*\testa@nostar[2][Default]{%
   Arg~1:~``#1'', arg~2:~``#2''.%
}
\makeatother
\begin{document}
   \testa*{First}{Second}

   \testa[Optional]{Mandatory}

   \testa{Mandatory only}
\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%

This kind of trickery will be a lot easier in the (near) future with the  
xparse package. You can get it from  
<http://www.latex-project.org/code/experimental/xbase.tgz> if you want to  
look at it.

I'm beginning to understand a thing or two now, thank you. My little

What's the difference between \newcommand and \newcommand*?

It's in usrguide (texmf/doc/latex/base) but I'll give it here as well (a  
copy of what I wrote on another list).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% copy begins
  The command in question:
  \newcommand*\vNameref[1]{`\nameref{#1}"\ \vpageref{#1}}

  Using the starred version of \newcommand means that the arguments of the
  defined command cannot contain a blank line or \par. This makes it a lot
  easier to spot runaway arguments.

  Let's consider the input

  Some text in English. See \vNameref{sec:2. Some text in English.
  Some text in English. Some text in English. Some text in English.
  Some text in English. Some text in English. Some text in English.
  Some text in English. Some text in English. Some text in English.
  Some text in English. Some text in English. Some text in English.
  Some text in English. Some text in English. Some text in English.
  Some text in English. Some text in English. Some text in English.

  With the non-starred version of \newcommand we get an error like this:
  %%%%%%%%%
  Runaway argument?
  {sec:2. Some text in English. Some text in English. Some text in Engl\ETC.
  ! File ended while scanning use of \vNameref.
  <inserted text>
                   \par
  <*> varioref.tex

  ? H
  I suspect you have forgotten a `}", causing me
  to read past where you wanted me to stop.
  I"ll try to recover; but if the error is serious,
  you"d better type `E" or `X" now and fix your file.
  %%%%%%%%%%

  With the starred version we instead get this (useful) message:
  %%%%%%%%%
  Runaway argument?
  {sec:2. Some text in English. Some text in English. Some text in Engl\ETC.
  ! Paragraph ended before \vNameref was complete.
  <to be read again>
                      \par
  l.25

  ? H
  I suspect you"ve forgotten a `}", causing me to apply this
  control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
  My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.
  %%%%%%%%%%

  So we can actually pinpoint the place where it goes wrong. The drawback is
  of course that you can't have arguments that span multiple paragraphs, bow
  how often does one have that kind of arguments, where they couldn't be
  more sensibly put inside an environment?

Be sure to precede the definition

\newcommand\foo{\@ifstar{\foos}{\foonos}}

with 

\makeatletter

and follow it with

\makeatother

(unless it is inside a package).

there's a rather new package on ctan, called suffix.sty (needs elatex,
which is the default in newer distributions).

so we can say:

\usepackage{suffix}
           \newcommand\fred {\message{fred}}
\WithSuffix\newcommand\fred*{\message{fred*}}

which is somewhat of an improvement on all that fiddling with
\makeatletter and \@ifstar.

i _like_ suffix.sty...
