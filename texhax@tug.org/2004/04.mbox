Subject: [texhax] problem with floats in two column
Message-ID: <406BC35C.7090205@netscape.net>

Dear Tug,

When I try to include an eps image using \begin{figure*} in \twocolumn 
job, by default the image is placed at top of the NEXT page.

I want to fix the figure at the bottom of the same page where i am 
refering it.

I gone through the faq and also tried using "stfloats, midfloat, 
fixltx2e, dblfloatfix" packages, but can't bring the float to bottom of 
the current page.

Also please suggest me, to typeset a 2 column job with lots of floats 
spaning to single column, which way is best, is it \twocolumn or 
"multicols" package.

Thanks in advance,

Raj

the output routine decides, when it sets up a new page 2-column page,
whether that page is going to have floats at its bottom.  this is an
inevitable consequence of the way latex's 2-column works :-(

if latex _knows_about_ the float before it starts the page, then
stfloats ought to do the right thing.

so, put the figure declaration _before_ the last paragraph on the
previous page.

note the unfortunate corollaries of this:

a: you can't have a double-column float at the bottom of the first page.
b: if you also have single-column floats, they're likely to get tangled
   up with the numbering restrictions (particularly if you also use
   dblfloatfix)

twocolumn, of course, since multicols doesn't do single-column floats.

The short answer is that BibTeX cannot do it; as you will have seen in
btxhak.dvi, the only choices are "t", "u" and "l".

The best approach is to write titles with the correct capitalisation in your
bib file, using {} to block anything that really must never ever change
(like acronyms).  Then, to get what you want, you don't need change.case$
and if some other style does use it (e.g., because a particular journal
requires "t") then it will still work properly.

Of course, with a lot of extra work(!), you could write a little BibTeX
macro that parses text strings and capitalises as you wish (but presumably
you don't want prepositions, articles etc. capitalised).

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

Hi,

 

LaTex is essential for my job. I'm writing all my scientific papers in
different types of Latex, Revtex, etc.

My HD crashed and I've lost the software. A colleague borrowed his CD
with Tex Live 6 and I tried to install it but it doesn't work.

 

I succeeded to install from internet ghostview, and ghostscript, so I
can see some ps files, but it's impossible to have this Tex Live 6
working. 

 

Please advise me what can I do to have a reliable version of Tex on my
computer.

 

Thanks,

Andy

Hello,

> Please advise me what can I do to have a reliable version of Tex on my
> computer.

Assuming you are running x86 hardware (Intel, AMD or compatible), there is 
another fallback possibility, if everything goes wrong:

Knoppix, from http://www.knopper.net/knoppix

It is essentially a complete Linux (Debian) distribution, bootable from a 
single CD, which does not touch your current computer at all, and it contains 
a complete (La)TeX installation. TeTeX, I believe.

The advantage is that you have a complete (La)TeX setup (don't know about 
REVTeX et al. though), already installed and configured, even if your host 
operating system is completely broken.

The disadvantages probably outweigh the advantages, though:
- It's a 700 MiB download, and requires a blank 700 MiB CD, a computer reboot, 
and boot-from-CD capability.
- You would need to learn enough Linux, the GUI and the command line, to mount 
your hard drives, edit your files, and run TeX on them. Most things can be 
done with buttons and a mouse (I think kile is installed, but I can't be 
sure), but it's still a steep learning curve.
- The solution is only temporary. For longer work, it is naturally better to 
be able to run TeX from your "own" computer, and the only way to make the 
Knoppix solution permanent would be to replace your current system with it.

So no, I'm *not* recommending that you try Knoppix for your immediate problem. 
However, it *is* a valid way to get "a reliable version of TeX on your 
computer", so I might as well mention it in this context. And you never know, 
if nothing else helps, and you need access to a TeX system fast, it just 
might be the thing you need.

If you (or anyone else who read this) have some time to spare, you may want to 
at least look over the Knoppix web page, and maybe try it out (there's little 
you can do wrong if you don't allow writing to your hard drives; this is 
disabled by default). Who knows, it might be useful during the next 
emergency, especially with a next-day deadline...

Bye,

  Benjamin

Hello Oggie,

    Our epsfig usepackage in the kile compiler of Linux does not work. Is 
    there a way to heal this kind of bug?

Probably, but more information is needed to even begin to guess what is
going on.  For instance, what is the input .tex file, what is the input
.eps file, what is the expected output, what is the output you got, what
dvi drivers did you use, etc.

Since epsfig obviously does work for many people, I suggest looking at
the FAQ and other documentation, for instance:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=impgraph
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=graphicspath
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/ammann/tex/tetex/doc/latex/packages/graphics/epsfig.dvi

Also, I kind of had the impression that explicit use of epsfig isn't
necessarily the best thing to do any more.  I usually just use
the default \includegraphics.

karl

Sure there is, you begin with sending a (small) test file to the list. This 
way we can see if the LaTeX file contains errors or not.

Note that Kile uses the TeX system installed on your computer, it doesn't 
provide it's own TeX system. Therefore I find it likely that your TeX system 
is not setup correctly (if the epsfig package installed for example?).

best,
Jeroen

How does it fail to work ? What Windows version are you running ? If it
is W9x or Me, try to disable any antivirus software before installing.
 
If downloading from internet is not a problem, you can get the same
texlive distribution by doing this :

start ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/fptex/0.7/TeXSetup.exe in Internet
Explorer, do not ask to 'save' but to 'open' the file
instead. TeXSetup.exe will run, do not change the default options except
for the 'scheme' you want to install (recommended, full,
...). Everything will be installed from the Internet, and you will get a
fixed TeXLive 2003 installation.

Dear Texhaxers:

I have a reference that should have an accent over an i in 'Garcia'. 
This form:

   Garc\'{i}a

works, but there is a dot on the i in addition to the accent.

The LaTeX book by Lamport on page 50 gives a solution: use \imath.
That is fine, but the i becomes math italic, which will not
do!

Ok, try to put it in an mbox:

{Garc\'{$\mbox{\imath}$}a de Abajo}

This fails because the imath is no longer in math mode.

The LaTeX FAQ has nothing about this that I could find:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?keyword=accent

Two other FAQs I list on my pages at
http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html#latex.tex.resources
don't help either.

Web searches didn't help.

Anybody have an idea for this?

(Amusingly, the cut and paste from the APS web site gave the unicode

does not - yet??? - accept this character.)

Lovely!  That worked!!!  To join the 'a' back in I needed to use {}

 and F. J. {Garc\'\i{}a de Abajo}
 and F. J. {Garc\'{\i}a de Abajo}",

both worked.

Unicode with LaTeX would be interesting, though I'm not sure how one

Try \'{\i} or use a different encoding, like T1.

Use \i rather than \imath.

Well you seem to be able to send Unicode e-mails: 

  Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII utf-8"

So LaTeX should not be too difficult (e-mail the files to yourself??).

Use the modifier key, on my keyboard for example (on a Linux box), the 
modifier key is the Windows key. Typing
Mod-',e (that is hold the modifier key while pressing ' and e consecutively), 
will produce an ?.

If you can't find your modifier key (or your distro didn't setup one for you) 
read:
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO.html

If you want to type Russian (for example), you can switch keyboard layouts (at 
least with KDE that is very easy to do) using a special defined keyboard 
shortcut or an system tray applet.

best,
Jeroen

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0404081619190.8108-100000@pcct700.ct.infn.it>

Hi,

I'm using the hyperref and dvipdfm packages to produce a pdf file from my
latex source code (MikTeX) which makes all references in the text to
equations, section numbers, and citations hyperlinked; furthermore, it
produces bookmarks (that can be opened up by clicking on the tag on the
left-hand side of Adobe Reader). The hyperlinks in the text appear as they
should; however, the bookmarks are not produced for a regular "Phys. Rev.
B-like" article (i.e. two-column format with title, authors etc.  
produced with \maketitle) written using the revtex4 document class. I have
played around with the different options a bit, and I have found that to
get bookmarks I must either drop the twocolumn option or drop the
\maketitle. Unfortunately, using the multicol package instead of twocolumn
is not a possible fix, since multicol is incompatible with revtex4. I have
also looked at some pdf files on the cond-mat archive and so far the only
files I have found that have bookmarks are in single-column format, which
may suggest that the solution to this problem may not be simple (or if it
exists, that it is at least not well-known). I also have googled for
possible solutions, but haven't found the problem described anywhere.

Any hint?

Thank you all in advance.

Giuseppe.

any public version of babel that works with 2.09 was scrapped something
like 10 years ago.  you need to search the net for *very* old versions
of the package.  current versions of babel will most emphatically not
help, unless you can bend plain tex babel to run with old latex.

it's likely that your client would do better to convert the document to
modern latex.

I looked in Kopka and Daly (4th edn, 2003) where, on page 415, I found 
the summary

TeX can use only 16 math alphabets. Apparently, you have exceeded this 
limit. Any additional math alphabet definitions are ignored.

They also indicate that this error comes up in connection with the NFSS 
(New Font Selection Scheme).

Goosens, Mittelbach and Samarin discuss "math alphabets" extensively on 
page 174ff.

At this point I am further in over my head than usual :-)
but I suspect the next step would be to learn a little more about the 
NFSS.  :-) Alternatively, if you just made a change to something which 
had been working, that would give a hint as to where to start.

Sorry I can't be more specific; I've never stumbled into this territory 
myself.

this is the right way to go; however, it would be good to know which
packages are in use.  some of them (e.g., bm.sty) have ways of backing
off so as to be less likely to cause the problem.

Yes, this is an advert ... no, it is simply vital information
that every user needs:-)...

In a soon to be published volume,
(see News on http://www.latex-project.org/ for further samples)
you will be able to find something very much like this
(together with many similar):

Error message:
  Too many math alphabets used in version <name>

Meaning:
  You used too many different math alphabet identifiers in your
  formulas.  If this error occurs after adding the bm package, define 
  \newcommand\bmmax{0} before loading bm and try again; this prevents
  the package from preallocating math alphabets.


It may be relevant.

That was a good start.

I ran LaTeX on the main file and got your error message. I then 
commented out the calls to the two subfiles and still got it.

I then wondered what the \begin and \end{letter} were doing, commented 
them out and it ran fine.

As to choice of letter class, I would have picked article as my default.
I changed that option and again all went fine. The first page of the dvi 
file shifted a bit (I suspect because the Dear X etc of a letter were 
not present) but otherwise looked ok to a rough inspection.

So, try dropping the \begin{letter} and \end{letter} calls and see if 
you like the end result. For comparision, change the \documentclass to 
article and inspect again.

Hope this sorts it out.

doug

PS The topic of the last bib item caught my eye and I went back to see 
what your area of interest was. Nowhere on page one could I find any 
specific indication of discipline (I did find math when I looked back at 
your .signature file). Might it not be a good idea to include this in 
the cv (even if it is to be "short")?

I'm not aware of any IRC channels, if that's what you mean, although
there are probably some somewhere.

    For lack of a better document class, I am using "letter" (is there a 
    better one?) 

I believe there are a number of classes for doing resumes.  An
article on the curve class for this was recently published in TUGboat,
you might want to look at that:
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb22-4/tb72verna.pdf

The actual class is at:
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/curve

   I cannot find any documentation on the letter documentclass

Neither can I, beyond the .dtx file (doesn't mean it's not there), but I
doubt it's the best starting point.

in this particular case, you could pull a macro from doc.sty (or
somewhere in that area):

  \DeclareRobustCommand{\cs}[1]{\texttt{\char`\\#1}} % from memoory

Thanks to all those who suggested possible causes for this funny message I 
was getting about too many math fonts.  I was using times with the bm.sty 
package.  I have since forgotten why I was using this particular package or 
what it does, but removing it also removed the problem with no discernable 
affect on output.  Many thanks again, friends.  ............Edgar

Message-ID: <20040412142558.GA28002@lnx00.cecm.usp.br>

Dear list,

I'd like to chance the appereance of my refences section reading. I'm
using LaTeX and bibtex. I'm just using a .bst file, not a .sty file to
change the looking of my references. I understand that I could make a
small change in a .sty file and get what I want, so I'd like to know
which file should I edit, i.e., which is the default .sty file that
the references section heading (am I right about this?)

Moreover, I'm using the secsty package. Is there a way to make it work
also over this specific heading?

Thank you very much in advance!

Cheers,

the bibliography environment is defined in your class file.  some
aspects of its appearance are parameterised (for example, you can easily
change the section title it uses).  as a general rule it's a good idea
to suggest _what_ changes you want to make when asking a question like
this...

it does, surely?  the biblio is just a starred section in an
article(-alike) class, and a starred chapter in a report/book(-alike)
class.

Oooops... I want to change just the color and the size... so, what file
should I edit exactly?

Subject: [texhax] Scaling math alphabets?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0404130832430.970-100000@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

I am trying to replace \cal by the Zapf chancery font, mainly because the 
latter has lower case letters and I would like to put names like Set and 
Top in this font.  However using
\DeclareMathAlphabet{\mathzc}{OT1}{pzc}{mb}{it}
followed by $\mathzc{Set}$ results in characters that are quite noticably 
smaller than the calligraphic characters.  They should scaled, probably by 
about 1200.  The Latex Companion does not appear to discuss this point.  
Is there any easy way of doing this.  I suppose I could do something like 
declaring various fonts to be pzcmi7t (which is what the .fd file loads) 
at various \magsteps and use \mathchoice to choose the correct one which 
differs according to the point size chosen, but this seems like a real 
kludge, exactly what the NFSS is supposed to obviate.  (But I have tested 
this and it works.)

Any thoughts?

Calligraphic fonts usually look smaller than roman fonts of the same point
size.

You can edit the .fd file  to have the font loaded with a scaling factor:
adding * [4] in the t1pzc.fd (or ot1pzc.fd for OT1 encoding) you get a loaded
font 4 times bigger than the actually requested size.

\DeclareFontShape{T1}{pzc}{mb}{it}{
   <-> * [4] pzcmi8t
}{}

Anyway, you need a much finer tuning, I guess with a factor of less than 1.1.

I am writing just to confirm that Chris's suggestion 

 \newcommand\bmmax{0} before loading bm

works very well, and is clearly better than not using bm.sty at all.  This 
way, you get to use the bm.sty package, but tex only sets up the math 
alphabets you actually use.  Many thanks, Chris.  .................Edgar

Yes, this is an advert ... no, it is simply vital information

In a soon to be published volume,
(see News on http://www.latex-project.org/ for further samples)
you will be able to find something very much like this
(together with many similar):

Error message:
  Too many math alphabets used in version <name>

Meaning:
  You used too many different math alphabet identifiers in your
  formulas.  If this error occurs after adding the bm package, define 
  \newcommand\bmmax{0} before loading bm and try again; this prevents
  the package from preallocating math alphabets.


It may be relevant.

    I have a LaTeX document that has several large tables. These tables are
defined using the longtable command. Most of the tables consists of 6 and 7
digit numbers. Since there are no commas in the numbers, it is hard to read.
I know I could manual enter the commas but that would be a big job. Is there
anyway I can get LaTeX to automatically insert the commas?

    I thank the group in advance for their responses.

Not that I know of.  However, a decent editor with "regular expression"
search and substitution capabilities should render the job rather less
daunting.

In particular, you can use vim in order to insert a column of commas.
Just select a block with Ctrl-C, then insert the comma with I (Insert)
and, magically, when you hit ESC, commas will appear all over the
column!

See Mr Ratcliffe's reply for details.

On a side note, you might want to insert "\," instead of a simple
comma. This is the new international standard, i.e. a space instead of
a comma between groups of three digits.

Doug Hespe.

May be new as a standard, but long considered good practice, since
many languages, e.g., French, German, have the roles of comma and point
interchanged with respect to English usage.  Thus 5,001 means
slightly more than 5 in these languages rather than slightly more than 5000.

Thanks to Luca Turchetti.  Yes that works.  Incidentally, it took a scale 
factor of about 1.2 to get the Zapf Chancery to look around the same size 
as \cal.  That is partly because the capitals, at least, have significant 
depth.  Anyway, it now works.  

Actually it seems to me a poor idea to actually change the fd file.  
Better to place the new definitions into an included file or even into the 
main file.

Hi fellows,

I cannot solve the following issue:

In a longtable, I want to color cells spanning over multiple rows, using the colortbl package. My first attempt with columns defined by \newcolumntype delivers the correct output:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{longtable, array, color, colortbl}
\begin{document}

\newcolumntype{A}{>{\columncolor{yellow}}l}    
\newcolumntype{B}{>{\columncolor[rgb]{.8,.2,.3}}l}    
\newcolumntype{C}{>{\columncolor{red}}l}    

\begin{longtable}{ABC}
\multicolumn{1}{A}{Vorlesung} & \multicolumn{1}{B}{Vorlesung} & \multicolumn{1}{C}{Vorlesung}\\
Vorlesung & \multicolumn{1}{B}{Vorlesung} & \multicolumn{1}{C}{Vorlesung}\\
Vorlesung & \multicolumn{1}{B}{Vorlesung} & \multicolumn{1}{C}{Vorlesung} \\
\multicolumn{2}{B}{Vorlesung} & \multicolumn{1}{C}{Vorlesung} \\
\end{longtable}
\end{document}

Unfortunately, the LaTeX document  is generated from a HTML table, which uses rowspan=n, so I have to use the multirow package. This package, however, does not seem to be compatible with the other packages involved. At least I have not found a way to use a certain columntype as one of \multirow's arguments.

Informally, the table should look like this, defining cells spanning over a single column but multiple rows in a certain color:

\begin{longtable}{ABC}
\multirow{3}{A}{Veranstaltung} & \multirow{5}{B}{Veranstaltung} & \multirow{2}{C}{Veranstaltung}\\
\multirow{4}{B}{Veranstaltung} & \multirow{1}{C}{Veranstaltung} & \multirow{3}{A}{Veranstaltung}\\
\end{longtable}

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Jan Eden

You could copy ot1pzc.fd in a new file, say ot1pzcbig.fd and modify the
latter as follows:

\ProvidesFile{ot1pzcbig.fd}
   [2000/01/12 PSNFSS-v8.1 font definitions for OT1/pzc.]

\DeclareFontFamily{OT1}{pzcbig}{}

\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{mb}{it}{
   <-> * [1.2] pzcmi7t
}{}

\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{m}{it}{<->ssub * pzc/mb/it}{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{mb}{sl}{<->ssub * pzc/mb/it}{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{m}{sl}{<->ssub * pzc/mb/sl}{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{m}{n}{<->ssub * pzc/mb/it}{}

\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{m}{ui}{<->ssub * pzc/m/it}{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{b}{ui}{<->ssub * pzc/b/it}{}
\endinput

After updating ls-R, you will be able to refer to pzcbig family in your
document, without having to change pzc defaults

Message-ID: <20040415234745.V857@stoat.clara.net>

Hi,

Hope someone can help here - this is my first post and I'm a novice with
TeX so I need examples to learn from; I've done a fair bit of searching
and have drawn a blank, so please don't flame me if the answer to my
question is in what you think is an obvious place.  I've seen some of the
posts on here recently.. and well.. you guys need to get out more and
relax :-) But seriously...

I want to make Cayley tables in either pure TeX or LateX - it doesn't
matter as long as they look nice (*).  Eventually I'll be generating these
from some software so something which lends itself to an algorithmic
approach would be cool.

I have looked through the following sources but with no joy:

o TeXbook
o LateX companion
o math examples that come with TeTeX distribution
o www.latex-project.org
o www.tug.org
o www.google.com
o www.planetmath.org

I found one solitary page which had some tables which looked good, but it
was only in PDF:

http://departments.mwc.edu/~jkoniecz/jkoniecz/431sol.pdf

If I had lots and lots of time I could probably work things out from the
fundamental building blocks of TeX, but as I say I'm really a novice -
I've no idea how difficult (or easy) this would be - an example would be a
flying start;  please don't laugh at my lack of knowledge :-)

So my question is:  are there any public-domain examples of Cayley tables
in LaTeX/TeX?

TIA,
DC-H.

(*) I found one which was essentially a square matrix with some blank
entries - I looking more for an actual table with at least two dark lines
to mark the borders.  I also want to shade some of the cells to highlight
various entries.

Well, that's for everyone to decide by themselves.  But enough said...

Why don't you try asking the author for the source?

Since there appears to be nothing intrinsically special about Cayley tables,
I would suggest just taking a look at any construction of tables with thick
and thin lines and colouring.

Probably the booktabs package has all that you need.  However, you might
also want to look at, e.g., the following packages and their documentation:
array, colortbl, tabls.

If your German is up to it there is a tutorial: tabsatz.

There is another nice tutorial set at http://www.tug.org/tutorials/tugindia/

See also Robin Fairbairns' FAQ:  http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq; there is an
entire section on table construction.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

P.S.  Googling -tables in latex line thickness- got me
www.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/booktabs.pdf as the
second entry.

hard to tell without some example of the effect.  a simple experiment
here doesn't reproduce it.

write a 5-10 line latex file that shows the effect happening, and post
that.  the following shows regular leading, as one would expect:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\begin{document}
here we are again, happy as can be, all good friends and jolly good company.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0404180803170.21723-100000@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

 While doing texnical editing on a paper for journal publication, I came
on a number of Latex font warnings about not using \scriptsize in math
mode.  Changing it to \scriptstyle cured that, but it should not
normally be necessary to use these commands at all.  What the author had
done was put in a number of definitions of the form
 \newcommand{\x}{\textit{\textbf{x}}}
in the preamble and a number of things like
 $$A_{\scriptsize{\x}}$$

 Eventually, blundering around (using new fonts is not something I have
done much of), I discovered that
\DeclareMathAlphabet{\mathbit}{OT1}{cmr}{bx}{it}
 \newcommand{\x}{\mathbit{x}}
worked quite nicely and is likely the official way of doing this. But I
would still like to know what is the systematic way of discovering that
this is how to do it.  Looking at cmr.fd, I guessed that {bx}{it} was
likely the right combinations of parameters, but where would I actually
find this information?

Here you'll either need to redefine \maketitle or use a more flexible  
documentclass (memoir or komascr) or a package intended for modifying  
the titling page (titling on CTAN).

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/titling

Searching on http://groups.google.com for ``latex cover page'' has as  
its first hit:

http://groups.google.com/groups?q=latex+cover+page&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF- 
8&oe=UTF- 
8&c2coff=1&safe=off&selm=3382E7DC.2781%40ab00.larc.nasa.gov&rnum=1

which shows a complete stand-alone example.

Have a look at the Breqn package, but be warned: It is alpha and

It takes more than just a set of fonts to typeset equations.

You need to use some sort of equation editor / typesetter.

I think it'd be best to have someone who understands them provide you 
with nice resolution-independent .eps or .pdf files for you to place, 
but....

If you're running Mac OS X, you can use Gerben Weirda's distribution 
which is free:

http://www.rna.nl/tex.html

You'll probably want a graphical front-end such as:

TeXshop - http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html
LyX - http://www.lyx.org

A more general, Mac-oriented site is here:

http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex

If you're still using Mac OS 9, the only free distribution is one for 
MPW (if you don't know what that is, it's not suited to you), so you 
would want to get cmactex, oztex (both of those are shareware) or 
Textures from Blue Sky TeX Systems.

Hi,

is there a LaTeX package which allows for simple revision control within a document (similar to Word's collaborative edit marking)? I use CVS myself, but my colleague refuses to learn/install it.

Thanks,

It works perfectly here. Did you run LaTeX two times so it can generate 
the references (1st pass) and read them in (2nd pass)?

I'd suggest deleting your .aux file(s) and running LaTeX 2x to 
regenerate them from scratch.

Message-ID: <D9FEA2B0-9928-11D8-A8F3-0050E4455404@atlis.com>

Posted this to comp.text.tex --- my apologies to those who're seeing it  
twice.

If memory serves, this is one of the things which TeX simply doesn't  
take into
consideration, right?

Something about an ``asynchronous page breaking mechanism'' or other?

Anyway, there are a couple of things I want to do on a per-spread  
basis, and
I'm not having any luck with, nor with finding docs / packages to help  
(perhaps
I'm not searching on the right things --- I'd advise against doing a  
search on
``latex page spreads counter'' at work however).

Basically, the first and simplest thing I want is a counter that resets  
after a
recto, and starts anew on a verso --- but when I set this in the  
evenheade(I'm
using memoir if that matters)

\makeevenhead{renumberingspreads}{\normalfont\bfseries\thepage}{\setcoun 
te
r{sdnoteno}{0}}{\normalfont\bfseries\leftmark}

it renumbers starting on a recto, continuing through the verso, then  
restarting
on the next recto.

I've tried putting it in the other three places and results were less  
pleasing
/ more random (one of them actually caused incorrect numbering (3  
before 2) on
one page).

I tried \strictpagechecktrue but no joy (and I got to watch marginpars  
come out
on the wrong side for the first run, weird).

Any other suggestions?

Does the ``\marks'' primitive in e-tex help with this sort of thing? If  
not,
does something else or has anyone else asked after / suggested such?

Thanks!

William

Thank you very much. I am a little surprised that it worked OK for you.
Someone else suggested that I put the labels inside the captions, and that
solved my problem -- leaving me feeling a little dumb of course for not
having thought of that myself.

Actually, I feel even dumber.

It wasn't working for me --- I thought your problem was you weren't 
getting references, but the problem was the two different references 
came out as Figure 1.

It also works if you move the \label commands to _after_ the captions 
--- the reason this is necessary is the figure number isn't updated / 
generated until the call to \caption AFAICT, so as to allow for 
un-numbered figures I'd guess.

Hope this makes up for my previous waste of bandwidth.

Dear William:

   Coffee did not help me any. Thanks for the explanation. What was
bugging me was that the aux file kept telling me the labels were created,
but I did not seem to be able to correctly access them. I am guessing the
same issues apply to Tables. I am in the process of writing a book, and I
really needed to figure out the label issue.

Well, the first thing to say is that \marks isn't e-TeX specific;
all that e-TeX did was to make /more/ marks available.  There is
no doubt that if you were working at the TeX (as opposed to LaTeX)
level, then \marks might well be of use, but such things are
rather harder to access (usefully) in LaTeX, and therefore you would
probably do better to either seek advice from a LaTeX guru, or
(for this project at least) to eschew LaTeX and use TeX.

 From the TeX perspective, what /exactly/ do you mean by
"a counter that resets  after a recto, and starts anew on a verso" ?

If you mean a counter /whose value is accessible and correct in the
main-line code/ (as opposed to accessible and correct during the
output routine), then I can't see (at the moment) how this could
be achieved.  As you correctly mention in your intro., TeX's
asynchronous page breaking mechanism gets in the way : the output
routine knows "where" you are in relation to a spread, but your
main-line code does not, as page-breaking takes place after para.s
have been assembled.  So while you /might/ be able to create a counter
whose value is well-defined /between/ paragraphs, it would be
very hard to create one whose value is well-defined /within/
a paragraph.

If you were to say a little more about what exactly you are trying
to achieve, it might be possible to offer more help.

Subject: [texhax] conditional macros
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0404291014030.1838-100000@barry-laptop.laptop.inc>

I seem to recall a discussion on this list recently about printing
terms in text in bold the first time they are used in a document, then
in normal font after that. I think the solution involved ifthen
commands.

I have a similar situation. I use macros to insert boilerplate
responses to submitted questionaires. The macros can include graphics,
and can be used more than once. I would like the graphics to be
used only once (to save space and avoid multiple labels).

Is there a way to check if a macro has already been used, and
treat it differently on subsequent uses?

In other words, the macro  \AnswerOne may be defined as:
  \AnswerOne{%
    text
    text
    \FigureOne{}
    }%

so that \FigureOne is expanded the first time but empty on subsequent
uses.

I'm familiar with basic LaTeX, but I'm not a programmer, so the
ifthen documentation is a little daunting. Sorry if it seems obvious.

Many thanks

Yes, this is easy to do.
Just make the macro redefine itself after the first usage.

You're welcome.

But of course I didn't tell the whole story.

>>    \newcommand{\FigureOne}{... whatever you want ....

   This only works if the first usage of \FigureOne
occurs at the outer paragraphing level.

Most likely you will have various environments,
perhaps even floats: figures, tables, etc.
or  minipages, in which you might use \FigureOne .
In this case, the \renewcommand re-definition will
be lost as you exit that environment (grouping-level).


Thus a better solution is to use TeX's \gdef :

\newcommand{\FigureOne}{... whatever you want ....
    \gdef\FigureOne{}}

This makes a `global' redefinition that should then
work in all normal situations...


  ... but *do not* use such self-redefining macros
within any moveable arguments:
   section-names, figure-captions, index-entries, etc.
where stuff gets written into auxiliary files, to be
re-read at a different time in the processing.
Can you imagine the sort of things that might then occur?


Best of luck with this,

	Ross

An alternative is to (mis)use the "acronym" package.  Quite simply, instead
of using it to define acronyms, use it to define a bold version for the
first occurrence.  Unfortunately, you'd need to hack it to alter the initial
occurrence output, which is, e.g., "operating system (OS)" - but that
shouldn't be too difficult.

Dear texhax,

I am setting out equations in

$$ $$ or in \begin{equation} \end{equation} and sometimes
inline with $ $
I want to show

Max U(c)

in the normal sized maths font and have the variables I am 
differentiating/maximizing with such as
m(h), n(h)
centered directly underneath Max U(c) in a smaller font.
I am trying to achieve the look given by the sum operator
with the summation items below.
I have tried using the array environment, stacking, atop
but these do not quite get the right effect.
I am using the amsmath package.

Any suggestions would be a great help. Thanks in advance.

Oops, ignore my earlier posting, I misread that you wanted to center the 
limits under the entire line.

Try this instead:
  \genfrac{}{}{0pt}{2}{\displaystyle{\max U(c)}}{\scriptstyle{m(h)}}

Basically, it lies to genfrac, making it believe the fraction is actually set 
at a much smaller size, then changing the size behind its back. You may have 
to use struts or boxes to get the bounding box back to the original size, 
though. I haven't tested it that far.

Hi,

looking in texbook.tex I've noticed that Knuth uses sometimes
nonbreakable space after the indefinite article, e.g. "once in

question is: is there any precise description of this rules?

I am not sure exactly what Stephen Lau wants, but he should take a look at 

$$\mathop{\textrm{Max}\,U(c)}_{x,y,z}$$
 
does.  If it is inline then you would need \limits before the _ to get the

All,

 From a previous Unix installation of TeX, I have my own .pfb's, 
psfonts.map, dvips prologues, tex inputs, etc., files that I would 
like to retain and use.

I have installed TeX 9/2003 in its default configuration on my Mac OS 
X 10.2.8 system.  The default TeX appears to work correctly.

My question is: how do I override the TeX defaults for the above 
files?  I'm sure it's in the documentation, but I can't seem to find 
it.  I would think there are a few environment variables I could set 
that would name user-local directories to be searched before the 
system defaults.  Is it that simple?  Could you provide examples or 
pointers to the relevant documentation?

Thanks,

John

    My question is: how do I override the TeX defaults for the above 
    files?

I recommend making a texmf-local tree, a sibling to wherever you
installed tl2003, and put everything under there.  (This is what I do
myself.)  You have an option to specify this dir when you install tl,
and then you do not even have to set any environment variables.

This is discussed throughout the install documentation.
http://tug.org/docs/tldoc/english/livese5.html is the specific chapter
for macosx, but most of the details are in the unix chapter (I didn't
want to repeat them).

The most difficult task will be getting the pfb's to work.  You have to
create/install map files for them and run updmap.  This process is not
well documented :(.

If you have comments on the documentation, let me know and I can try to
improve it this year.
