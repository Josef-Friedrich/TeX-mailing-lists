Actually it's easy:

Then: tex -> dvips

Thanks a lot, it worked perfectly.

But my final purpose was to insert some coloured text inside Metapost
labels.
And it didn't work.
I tried to follow exactly what is said on page 21 of John Hobby's Metapost
manual:
my metapost input file looks something like this:



verbatimtex \input color.tex etex

beginfig(1);
  .
  .

label(btex \textcolor{red}{Hi} etex,z2);
  .
  .



No complain, no error message;
but in the .ps file there's `Hi' normally black. What can I do?

Thanks indeed,
Rodolfo

Is there a Type 1 or TrueType font of this at this time?

I found this as Google's ``I feel lucky'' hit:

http://www.deafblind.com/moon.html

Is there a font hereabouts (link to this page said there was)?

http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/code/ 
public_rnib001950.hcsp

It'd be trivial to set up an extant font in LaTeX, and one could even  
set up an ``Omega translation Process'' to have the abbreviations  
handled automatically (one could feed it a plain text w/o markup and  
have them used automatically).

Or do you need to drive some specialized impression-making tool?

That's a clever idea but is there a way for the random color to
be determined by the pdf generation rather than the awk? I wouldn't
want all my 'a' being the same color and all my 'b' being the same
color ....

Note that nonsensical structures can be drawn with this package
for example the structure headed \naphdrv[ob]
has a pentavalent carbon atom ... even first year students shouldn't be making
a mistake like this!

If you want proper chemical structures do not use LaTeX packages; all
the ones that I have seen do not have sufficient intelligence and the
requisite power to do chemical structures properly, and, they are
very hard to use.

but then, not even i (who never finished my first year of natural

this could be said of almost any graphical language expressed in tex.
yet there are fields of endeavour in which pretty much the only
reasonable representation is so drawn.  if you _know_ that you can
represent the molecules you want to talk about, using xymtex (or the
like), why bother to learn any other package?  after all, one man's
package of choice is another man's "hard to use" -- else the world would
be overrun by latex users :-)

Should not the students have sufficient intelligence to get the 
structures right? (And yes, I do believe that spelling checkers and 
various "features" of certain word processors *have* hurt students' 
ability to write well.)

Well, if you have a random number generator for TeX, you could use 
Omega, and use an Omega Translation Process to replace each letter w/ a 
macro call to typeset said letter in a random colour.

Subject: [texhax] bug on vertical spacing w/ hyperref+seminar
Message-ID: <200403021452.i22EqAVU008163@nitro.onera>

Hello,

With seminar (and slidesec.sty) the vertical spacing between a slide heading and 
the text changes depending on whether hyperref is loaded or not.

This bug occurs at least when the following combination is true:
- the text begins with an itemize environment,
- the slide heading is centered (default with \slideheading{} as defined in 
slidesec.sty).

It seems that with hyperref, there is a blank line before the first item of the 
itemize environment that constitutes the text.

This occurs with v6.73n that comes w/ our 2.0 teTeX distribution as well as with 
the latest v6.74m downloaded today.

I attach a minimal example. Commented out is a possible redefinition of 
\makeslideheading which is used by the \slideheading command of slidesec.sty. If 
one removes the "\centering" and the "\par" then the bug disappears, but the 
"\par" is necessary for the centering to work )-;

Any help will be most welcome...
Thanks in advance,


        Laurent Mugnier.

Thanks Jim Adams, E.Krishnan, Phillip G.Ratcliff and Thomas, Larry.


All of your suggestions not only helped in that problem, but opened my 
eyes to a few things I was unaware of. 

Thanks again,
problem solved.

Dear Staff at tug.org
I received two copies of this email from you, as well as a forwarded copy from
another subscriber who concluded, as I did, that it was probably a virus
sent masqueraded as coming from you.  You may want to do some checking
as to whether your system is contaminated or someone else is masquerading.
I hope I will not be unsubscribed.  I am fairly confident that my system
(a linux operating system) is not compromized.
I hope this message is of some use.

Subject: [texhax] Precision on: bug on vertical spacing w/ hyperref+seminar
Message-ID: <200403031058.i23AwPVU017590@nitro.onera>

Hello all,

Here is an additional piece of information about:

>With seminar (and slidesec.sty) the vertical spacing between a slide heading and 
>the text changes depending on whether hyperref is loaded or not.
>
>This bug occurs at least when the following combination is true:
>- the text begins with an itemize environment,
>- the slide heading is centered (default with \slideheading{} as defined in 
>slidesec.sty).
>
>It seems that with hyperref, there is a blank line before the first item of the 
>itemize environment that constitutes the text.
>
>This occurs with v6.73n that comes w/ our 2.0 teTeX distribution as well as with 
>the latest v6.74m downloaded today.
>

The unwanted additional empty line is triggered by the command \hyper@@anchor on line 
4055 of hyperref.sty v6.74m. This line is part of the definition of \slide@heading 
and is the key to the hypertext navigation in the slides )-;. If this line is 
commented out then the empty line vanishes.

Any help will be most welcome...
Thanks in advance,


        Laurent Mugnier.

PS: I attach a mini-minimal example.

Hi Rashmi,
 You need to read some elementary documentation of latex. Have a look at
 http://www.tug.org/begin.html and read "The not so short introduction
 to Latex" and "Formatting Information" given under the heading of
 Online Documentation. This will give you some hints on how to start
 writing latex documents.

HTH,
Aditya

You can try TeXDesign, which is a general purpose design program for LaTeX. 
You can get a self-extracting zip file from my web site, under "TeXDesign

Hello, 
I'm sorry if I am writing to the wrong place regarding this question,
but I have not been able to find help anywhere!
 
It seems simple enough.  I am using LaTeX to write my software
engineering documents for my senior project at school.  I love it, and
it works great.  However, my advisor is really anal, and he insists that
the table of contents has the title "Table of Contents" in the center at
the top of the page.  The table of contents file automatically generated
by LaTeX puts just "Contents" at the top on the left.  
 
I have the LaTeX companion and a Math into LaTex book, and I have been
looking everywhere on the web.  I can't find any information on how to
alter the table of contents header.  I have also looked at the .toc and
.aux file, but there is no place in those files that lists the header.  
 
If you can help, or know where I can find a solution, I would greatly
appreciate it!!!
 
 
Thank You,

Put this in your preamble for the wording (I'm surprised you didn't find
this one):

\renewcommand\contentsname{Table of Contents}

For the centering you can either play with the following:

\newcommand\tableofcontents{%
    \section*{\contentsname
        \@mkboth{%
           \MakeUppercase\contentsname}{\MakeUppercase\contentsname}}%
    \@starttoc{toc}%
    }

Or use the "tocloft" package (again, I'm surprised you didn't find it).

A look in http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq

    The UK TEX FAQ Your 338 Questions Answered
    version 3.10e, date 2003/11/18 Maintained by Robin Fairbairns

at Q.183 "The format of the Table of Contents, etc." would have pointed you
at the "tocloft" package.

Give

\def\contentsname{\centerline{Table of Contents}}

in the preamble of the document, i.e., between \documentclass and
\begin{document}

    I am developing a set of notes using LaTeX. These notes include theorems
which I typeset use the \begin{theorem} and \end{theorem} commands. I find
these commands work very nicely. LaTeX generates theorem numbers starting at
1.
I would like to start the theorem numbers at 4. Is there any way to do this?

I presume you defined the theorem environment using
\newtheorem{theorem}{<name>}

Then \addtocounter{theorem}{3} changes the value of the theorem counter, as
usual.

You can change this to suit your needs.

Hi,

I avoided orphan and widow lines using 

\clubpenalty=10000
\widowpenalty=10000

in the preamble. However, that cannot avoid widow headings (I hope i am using 
the terminology correctly, I mean the last line in a page which is a section 
heading).

Is there anything I can do to handle it automatically? This happens 7-8 times 
in my 150 pages report and may be I can manually add a pagebreak. However, 
the document tends to change often which requires this manual adjustmen often 
too.

I would deeply appreciate if someone could tell me how to achieve this 
automatically.

\thinmuskip=2mu

Is it possble to adjust the spacing between mathtype characters that are 
embedded in the text which is consistent with above spacing for displayed mathtype 
characters?

Thanks in advance for any help.

I am a new subscriber here so possibly asking about something most know
the answer to.

 

I use latex quite a lot to write math papers but always have trouble
when I try to make slides, using the slides document class.

 

I cannot get most of the usual math commands such as \begin{equation} or
\begin{multline} or \begin{matrix} to work when I use the slides
document class, with the result that I often have problems creating
slides with complicated math formulae.

 

Is there something I need to add in the preamble or what is the
solution?

I highly recommend the
foils
package and the
PPower4
package.
You can get the latest version and learn more about the latter at
http://www-sp.iti.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/software/ppower4/
It's a great solution for those who like LaTeX, must typeset
fairly complicated equations, and want a projection slide or
transparency that looks reasonably professional.
It may require a bit of rearranging to avoid a long equation running
off the page, but I've found that I can take a document produced for
printing on paper and carve it into slides fairly quickly and easily.
If your making slides from scratch, it's even easier.
It's well worth the investment to learn it.
I've been using it to create transparencies and laptop presentations
for my chemistry lectures in physical chemistry (thermo, stat. mech. and
quantum) for several years, and found it to be great.

slides is so ineffably feeble, and there are so many better
alternatives, that i am always surprised nowadays when someone appears
to say they're using it.

multline needs the amsmath package: it may be worth trying it with
slides class.  however, slitex (the precursor of slides class) was
designed for a world of such trivial capabilities that it's strong on
producing colour overlays for slides (since colour printers weren't
generally available back then), and spurns many things one mostly
expects.

unless you're somehow stuck in the past, producing overlaid foils, i
strongly recommend that you review

http://www.miwie.org/presentations/presentations.html

which offers a constructive comparison of packages and classes designed
for presentations.

personally, i've switched to the (rather new) beamer class: its name
makes clear its aim in life -- for presentations done by projecting a
computer screen.  its documentation is a good read, even if you stop at
the points where it turns technical.

Obviously, you didn't look at the FAQ indicated at the foot of all postings.

Otherwise, you would have found Q. 207 "Flowing text around figures in
LATEX."

         I know from experience with this list that we are supposed to be 
embarrassed when we ask a question which has an answer in the FAQ. I also 
know from experience that using the FAQ is extremely difficult, or else I 
don't know how to use it. Even after seeing your response Philip, it took 
me about ten minutes to find the correct location of Q. 207. I used 
"flowing text" and then read through many entry titles in the reply.
         The fact is, the FAQ doesn't work right, because it is not 
organized properly. I don't mean this as a criticism, but rather as a 
comment. I also don't know for sure what to do about it.
         I suspect that hooking up to a really powerful local search 
engine, like google, would do the trick. I can usually find anything with 
google.
         Indeed, typing "wrap text around figure latex" in the google 
command line gave me a wealth of clues, including some latex packages. I'm 
sure that using the FAQ and typing in the name of one of the packages with 
the FAQ search engine will do the trick.

If what you want is to have some FIXED text next to your figure (as
opposed to text flowing around it), put the graphic and text inside a
tabular environment. Use the array package to control the vertical
alignment within the single row to centre the text vertically next to
the figure. This will also work inside a floating environment, although
it will take a guru to tell you how to convince latex to accept the
\caption inside the tabular environment. But you can put it outside the
tabular but inside the float. 

I won't scream at you for not finding your way 'round the TeX Faq. [But
I found everything I needed by typing a few keywords into google(!)
though I have a few phrases I turn to when I'm desperate,  like "use
tabular" or "put it in an hbox" which got me most of the way. ]

Here's a short sample (use your own figure in place of png):

-----------------------snip-------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{array}

\begin{document}

Let's try

% m{<width>} centres vertically in a col of width <width>
\begin{tabular}{m{0.3\textwidth}|m{0.7\textwidth}}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{png} & 
\parbox{0.5\textwidth}{Here is a
bunch of text which will get set alongside the figure.}
\end{tabular}

And it works in a figure environment as well:

\begin{figure}
\begin{tabular}{m{0.5\textwidth}m{0.5\textwidth}}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{png}
 & \parbox{0.45\textwidth} {Here is a
bunch of text which will get set alongside the figure.}
\end{tabular}
\caption{What a pretty figure}
\end{figure}

\end{document}

um ... i responded to your post, before i got philip's response, with
the actual url.  (easy for me to find, since i remember what the label
is, so subject to typos, i get there in one.  i did mistype, so i got
there in two.)

there's a google-search link on the faq main page.  takes you to a
faq-restricted google search: did that not help?

i'm not an expert on search engines.  my self-teaching progress is
proving painfully slow.  i've remarked about this on c.t.t, and asked
for help.  no help has been forthcoming (there was one offer, but it's
come to nothing).

so the searching isn't going to improve.  in a long time.  (while i
educate myself.)

Dear Herbert,

Well, that's not my intent, really - I'm simply trying to persuade
people to look there first.  Obviously, without a great deal of success
though.  I am sure there are many who do not even consider it whereas I
would imagine that I find somthing like at least ninety percent of the
cases have an answer there.

Moreover, I've just reread my answer - it doesn't sound that harsh to
me.  I've often been more polite in the past - but it didn't make me any
more effective.

Aha, well I use the pdf version (which can be downloaded from the same
place) and then simply scan the contents pages (the subects are grouped
rather well) or use the Acroread (I use version 6.0) search utility -
"figure" gets Q. 207 as the third entry (quick enough I'd say).

That seems to be a general problem of FAQ lists - but I'd say that my
solution (above) works pretty well in this case.

Even googling often needs a similar amount of "intelligent guesswork".
And I would imagine that those who don't look in the FAQ don't google
either.  On the other hand, you could, indeed, replace FAQ with Google
in all my comments above.

what i've changed.  apart from significant changes to the macro coding
of faq source and of the conversion to html for the web version,
highlights include: 17 new answers, extension of several "documentation
and help" answers; thorough scan of answers for places where either or
both of the koma-script bundle and the memoir class can help; many
changes to reflect upgrades of several packages, or packages that
weren't previously mentioned.  and of course, several errors are
corrected.

please report any errors of fact, or of representation, to faq@tex.ac.uk

please do _not_ bother to ask questions on that address.  if you're
reading this message on comp.text.tex or texhax, you *already* *know*
where to ask questions.

the future of the faq may potentially include significant improvements
in its delivery.  there is, sadly, little chance that i can improve the
searching mechanisms without external help (all pleas for such help have
proved fruitless): i don't have the spare time to make myself an expert
in such things.

Is anyone aware of a means of using a sound file (e.g., narration, music or sound effects) with a Beamer file such that the sound file is synchronized with each page?  The latest edition of the userguide (10 Mar 2004) does not appear to address this question.

Thanks.

I worked on it some more and I have got the floatflt package working, though, it
appears to be somewhat unstable?! That is, sometimes the \includegraphics
doesn't include anything. When changing another figure to floatingfigure close
to a floatingfigure, that is, I have two floating figures close to each other,
one disappears. It will work for now, but I will probably get back to this
subject in the future.
Thank you for all your help.

For a paper containing many equations in Word format, "a little side money" probably won't be enough.

Depends on what platform you're on. For Mac OS X, I highly recommend gwTeX (complete setup, easy installation):

<http://www.rna.nl/tex.html>

For Windows, try MikTeX:

<http://www.miktex.org>

Both distributions do not include editors, though. If you want to use a WYSIWYG interface, check out LyX.

HTH,

Jan

Have you looked at the shareware program Word2TeX?

http://www.word2tex.com/

Jan's answers on this were good. There are commercial implementations 
which come w/ varying levels of support though.

I'd suggest also looking at http://www.lyx.org which you (and your 
boss) may find more palatable. The QT version for Windows or Mac OS X 
is particularly nice. Then you could run word2tex, pull the LaTeX into 
LyX, fix it in a graphical / WYSIWYM environment and export nice LaTeX.

Hello Nava,

    My boss wants me to use TeX to format one of his equation-filled
    articles on general relativity by Friday (yes, really!).  

Good luck.

For a discussion of conversion programs, take a look at
http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/pctotex.html (which list includes the
word2tex program previously mentioned).  I don't think anything
automated will do a 100% job, but it would probably be a lot better than
starting from scratch.

    just filled out TUG's online application in order to get the TeX Live
    software, but I see it might take 2 weeks before anyone even
    acknowledges my application.

Actually, we should reply right away.  The only reason it might take a
few days is because of vacations.  I should probably change the text.
If you haven't heard back already, please tell me.

    So I would like to know the following:
    -          Does anyone in your group process Word documents into TeX
    format for a little side money? :-)

You might look at http://tug.org/consultants.html and try to hire
someone from there.  I don't mean to be negative, but a Friday deadline
sounds impossible, if you're starting with no TeX experience and a
document with lots of equations.

    -          If not, can I go ahead and download TeX Live? Is it easy to
    use for the non-scientist who enjoys easy software programs and doesn't
    want to be challenged in a TeXy way?

No, TeX Live is not a standard Windows application.  Although we do our
best, TeX is simply not "easy" when starting with only GUI/Windows sort
of experience.

BTW, you don't really need all of TeX Live to do the job at hand.  If
you want to try downloading something, I suggest www.fptex.org (which is
included in TL), or www.miktex.org as another respondent suggested.
However, simply installing TeX is usually challenging.  Then *using* it
to get those equations right and everything else will be another.

Good luck.

Hi Karl,

I am also sending this note to the support and texhax addresses, because
I received so many helpful emails that I can't reply to them all
individually, but I did want to express my thanks to everyone who took
the time to write to me! 

With all the advice I received (from here and comp.text.tex), I was able
to get up and running with MikTeX and WinEDT.  And after finding out
that our equation editor (MathType) can translate its equations into 4
flavors of TeX and LaTeX, I was able to copy  my boss' document into
notepad (so it would be plain text) and then process it into LaTeX
rather easily, using the equations from the Word document.  So yes, it
requires me to have 3 or 4 programs open at a time, but after what I've
been through this week, I won't argue with success! :)  

So, I just want to say thanks, and I look forward to learning more! But
I know where to turn for answers when I hit a brick wall. :)

the fancyhdr package (which should be in your distribution, and which
comes with very good documentation), will allow you to do pretty much
anything you like with headers and footers.  header but no footer? -- no
problem.

Hello, 

you can easily create your own .bst file and specifying every part of your 
citations via

latex makebst 

somewhere it prompts if you want to include pp.

It's certainly not a default behaviour of natbib; sounds like you're using
the "citeref" package - just don't load it.

Subject: [texhax] Makefile dependencies for complex documents
Message-ID: <ym9lllspnyq.fsf@wolf.cl.cam.ac.uk>

Hi,

The problem of using make to compile latex documents has been
discussed here before, but the only solutions I know of (latexmake,
latexmk, texi2dvi) are basically designed to run
latex/bibtex/makeindex sufficiently many times to resolve all
_internal_ dependencies of a latex document.  I am after automatic
generation of a Makefile with _external_ dependencies, such as files
included by \includegraphics, \input, etc.

A little internet search revealed that there is a program called
makelatex, which generates these dependencies. However, it does this
by scanning the input file and all files that are explicitly included
with the \input command.  This approach works with simple cases but
fails, for example, when the input command is hidden inside a macro.

I think, the better way would be to redefine \input so that it would
write the name of the file-to-be-included to a special auxiliary file,
say \jobname.dep.  This file would then be processed by another
program, which would resolve all file names and produce a proper
Makefile entry.

So far, I haven't found anything like this, so I've written a couple
of tex macros and a very crude filename resolution program.  Because
this program currently looks for files only in the current directory,
I haven't redefined \input yet.  Instead, macro \dep used in front of
\input causes the latter command to log the filename into
\jobname.dep:

\expandafter\ifx\csname dep\endcsname\relax
\newwrite\dependfile
\openout\dependfile=\jobname.dep\relax
\def\depends#1{\write\dependfile{#1}}%
\def\dep#1#2{\depends{#2}#1{#2}}%
\fi

I'm looking for comments, esp. about how to write a file-name
resolution program that would work in most cases (i.e., that would
search not only the current directory but also the texmf tree).  Any
suggestions for improving the above piece of code are also welcome
(I'm not really an experienced tex programmer and don't know much
about latex internals, which would probably make the code simpler).

note, of course, that your \dep macro won't work with an unadulterated
("primitive") \input command (which is distinguished by an almost
unparseable syntax); but then, the same is true of almost any
mechanism.  since the primitive command is so awful, people typically
hack on the latex-sanitised version.

anyway, what's wrong with getting into the \listfiles mechanism?  you
may care to look at
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=filesused (on a computer
near you) which discusses the issue somewhat.  the packages it mentions
may repay analysis: i've not looked at them since i wrote the faq
answer.

Yes, I was under the impression that I was reinventing the wheel.
Indeed, the \listfiles macro solves the problem, and some code from
the bundledoc package can be easily reused to find the absolute
filenames, which are necessary to generate the Makefile.

Thanks,

Assuming they didn't address this, one must then consider work-arounds.

I believe that the best thing to do would be to write really plain / 
straightforward LaTeX (or translate to that) and to then use latex2rtf 
to get a .rtf file which Robohelp (this is one of those over-grown .rtf 
-> Microsoft .hlp utilities, right?) can import.

If Latex2rtf won't work for you, you could try the commercial program 
tex2word (I believe the URL is http://www.tex2word.com )

Message-ID: <AEECF2FBB179D044B2B1E93F1C98BEAFD36030@lin0018.roseninspection.net>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hi all,
I have a special problem I can't get managed:
I have a unique identifier (user-defined) in my documents,
which may or 
may not include other macros (preferred \_, but anything
may be possible). 
Now I need to remove all macros from this string in order
to use it as a 
save label-generator.
I just don't find a way to remove all the macros from the
string.

% Example:

\newcommand{\identifier}[1]{
  \newcommand{\myID}{#1}
  \renewcommand{\identifier}{\myID}
}

\begin{document}
\identifier{abc\_def\macro{}ghi}
This is Document \myID, uniquely known as \identifier.

\begin{figure}
\caption{\label{\identifier:F1} my first image}
\includegraphics{firstImage.jpg}
\end{figure}
\end{document}

%end Example

Obviously this does not work, latex produces lots of error
messages 
concerning the macros in the label. So I need to redefine
the label 
that it looks like "abcdefghk", i.e. remove all macro names
from the string.

How do I have to redefine \identifier in the first place to
get this 
result?

I already tried splitting the argument like
\process{\myID}
\long\def\process#1\@proc #1@@@
\long\def\@proc#1#2#3@@@{\def\myNewID{#1#3}
\renewcommand{\identifier}{\myNewID}

and similar constructs with defined #2, but each test
stopped at the 
definition of the macros which is expanded somewhere in the
process.

Did anyone solve this problem ? (if it's in the FAQ it
completely
escaped my search, sorry)

Hi,

I'm trying to figure out how to deal with the following situation.
There is no urgent need but I'm still curious how to deal with this.
My daughter's third grade class is doing some reports and they must
be done in Word. I'd like to know how to do this in latex. I've found
some bits and pieces but can't put it all together. It's a bit
beyond my current skills. They have a requirement that on pages with
pictures there can be no more than 8 lines of text. If a paragraph gets
interrupted then so be it. Of course the last line should be right
justified and the continuation should not be indented. You can bend the
rules for single line widows/orphans which may simplify the task.

Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

Ian:

You can accomplish this using the \setcounter  and associated commands. Here is an example that is placed in the preamble of a document using the memoir class:

\setcounter{tocdepth}{1} \setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
\maxsecnumdepth{subsubsection}

What this does is three things: (1) it sets the table of contents depth to level 1 (section), (2) sets the section numbering depth to level 3 (subsubsection) and (3) sets the maximum section numbering depth to subsubsection.

The number values for the levels in a document are:

-1 = Part
0 = Chapter
1 = Section
2 = Subsection
3 = Subsubsection
4 = Paragraph
5 = Subparagraph

If you don't want to use the memoir class, you can use the tocvsec2 package (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/tocvsec2.html). This package has a dvi file from which you can generate the package manual.

Good luck.

it doesn't appear in the faq, because there isn't really an answer
(leastways, not in latex: plain tex users may have more luck since
they've more control over what's happening).

some long time back, i wrote a primitive thing for a fellow research
student who had to give an expert opinion for the defence of some poor
bloke who was being shafted by his bank.

i've lost my original, but someone else has found it and worked on it,
and someone else again has put it up on

  http://mechanics.civil.tohoku.ac.jp/~bear/bear-collections/style-files/numberpar.sty

i've had bright ideas about improving it over the years, but faced with
the code in front of me again, i've chickened out.

perhaps it'll help -- it's documented (in comments in the .sty file) as
if for latex2.09

otherwise, there's a paragraph numberer on sarovar.org somewhere.  last
i looked at it, it was more primitive even than my one was all those
years ago when i lost it.  but maybe it's been improved since.

the problem is, that the "natural" tex primitive (\everypar -- a token
register, as it happens) to do the job is also heavily used by latex for
all sorts of things, so that it's very difficult to turn it to the
business of generating a paragraph number while not interfering with the
rest of latex.

Just save it in gbpara.sty and use it as:

\usepackage{gbpara}
...

\begin{document}

...
%% Here starts a par which we want to be numbered
\gbpara{}I'm a numbered paragraph! ...
...

\typeout{Package: `gbpara', experimental}

\newcounter{gbparacounter}
\newlength{\gbparaindent}
\setlength{\gbparaindent}{0.5em}% you can tune this
\newcommand{\gbpara}{%

which will of course work, since it relies on the human to determine
what [s]he wants to be numbered.

the numberpar thing i wrote in the early 90s tried to be more nearly
automatic than that, and wasn't entirely successful.  (... and isn't
entirely successful, even following hacks by other people.)

Well, actually this is exactly what I want: being able to decide when

Subject: [texhax] how to put a figure and its caption on separate pages
Message-ID: <Sea2-F16C6M8BIWhkWz0002241d@hotmail.com>

Hi, guys:

Can anyone tell me how to specify it within figure enviornment so the 
caption of the figure will apear on the next page?  Of course, you can use 
regular text to replace the caption, but I still want that the numbering of 
the figure appearing in front of the caption, i.e. "Figure 3: ......", 
changes automatically.)

\usepackage{dpfloat}
...
% make sure no other figures or tables remain to be printed
\begin{figure}[p]
  \begin{leftfullpage}
    <your figure>
  \end{leftfullpage}
\endfigure
\begin{figure}[tp]
  \caption{your figure's caption}
\end{figure}

(the use of dpfloat only has effect if you have twoside operation, but
the principle's the same: the "figure" containing nothing but caption
will come on the next page, come what may.)

Subject: [texhax] texutil security bug reports.
Message-ID: <20040325201603.60701.qmail@web25110.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hello,

Excuse me if this isn't the right email to contact,
but I didn't find anything about TeX bug reports in
the FAQ.


I believe I have found some issues in the texutil Perl
script, which may allow a potential attacker to
overwrite arbitrary files.  There may be more
instances of similar vulnerabilities in texutil, but
these are the few I found.


1) Symlink vulnerability when --silent is used.

This bug occurs due to insecure file handling, when
the --silent flag is used at the shell.  When --silent
is used, texutil.log is written with all program
output, instead of being written to stdout.  The
insecure file creation code is here:


Lines 125 - 137
--
$ProgramLog = "texutil.log" ;

sub RedirectTerminal
  { open SAVEDSTDOUT, ">&STDOUT" ;
    open STDOUT, ">$ProgramLog" ;
    select STDOUT; $| = 1 }

#D And, indeed:

if ($ProcessSilent)
  { RedirectTerminal }
else
  { $ProcessVerbose = 0 }
--

As you likely know, $ProcessSilent is set when the
--silent flag is issued at the command line with the
texutil invokation.  This can be exploited by users
with write access to the directory which the targetted
user is working in:

--
example$ ls -al /etc/nologin
ls: /etc/nologin: No such file or directory
example$ ln -s /etc/nologin texutil.log

[...]

root# texutil --silent

[...]

example$ ls -al /etc/nologin
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         1511 Mar 25
20:03 /etc/nologin
--

Although different system files could've been
corrupted, I hope this helps to demonstrate, at least.


2) Insecure tmpfile opening

I haven't explored this one very well, or in what
conditions it could be exploited, but the vulnerable
code is here:


Lines 1701 - 1703
--
else
      { open ( EPS, ">texutil.tmp" ) ;
        binmode EPS }
[...]
--

If the user had the correct privileges (i.e write
access to the current working dir), perhaps this could
be exploited by linking texutil.tmp to an arbitrary
sensitive system file.  Sorry for not providing much
info on this one, but by the code it is apparent that
it could be an issue.



Although the issues do require the user to have write
access to the working dir of the victim, this is by no
means infeasible.  I.e the user might be in the same
GID, but might have a more privileged UID.  Or, the
root user might've 'cd /tmp', and forgotton to revert
back to his/her /root home directory.  Do you agree
with my points?

It should be noted, that I suspect there are a few
more bugs/vulnerabilities similar to these few that I
commented on in the texutil code - I didn't check the
code thoroughly, but more could exist.  You may wish
to check.  Maybe 'grep' the code for 'open' calls and
route out the ones which are sources of trouble.

My suggested fix for this, if you are willing to fix
it (I hear texutil is a popular & useful tool), would
be to use 'sysopen' instead of 'open' and then check
for an error, and 'die' if a file already exists by
the name.  I think this would be more secure, do you
agree?  I could maybe have a go at fixing this if you
no longer maintain it or something, I could perhaps
produce a patch.

Cheers.



Thank you for your time.
Shaun.

Subject: [texhax] How can I copy all contents in \box255?
Message-ID: <1594746.1080301221854.JavaMail.root@mail1.chula.com>

Hi,
        I use "lineno" package in my book and it works well. However, If I can get all contents from \box255 before it will be \unvbox at every line by the output routine, I will surely improve my book series.
 
        At first , I tried to copy the box's contents into a token register, but it didn't work. 

        So, could you please suggest me how to get that contents from \box255
before \unvbox will blow all of my contents to vertical list by output routine in "lineno" package.

        Thanks a lot in advance for your kind suggestion.

Regards,
Rahagadhi Yamanag

since \box255 is worked on asynchronously in the output routine, the
only place you can sensibly approach it is through the output routine.

the code of the output routine is in the latex source, file
ltoutput.dtx; this is a documented source, though imo the documentation
is not terribly good.

there are no documented sources of the lineno package, so you read the
code and its source direct.

however, your belief that access to the vertical list will help you does
not tally with my understanding of the latex output routine.  i suggest
you offer an explanation of what you hope to do: with that, there is a
good chance that some one will offer alternative means of achieving your
aims.  (or will explain why your aim is not possible.)

So there is a great oppotunity for someone to add good documentation to
these files: any offers?

Agreed; what is it you want to copy? The box itself? The vertical list in the box?
The text of the (partial) paragraphs that are typeset in the box ????

If I suppose that you do not want to put more than one "picture" per
page, then a simplistic solution that comes to mind is to define a
command similar to the one you use for inclustion of "pictures" (or
redefine it), so that it leaves no more than eight lines of vertical
space on the page.

Something like (UNTESTETED!):

\usepackage{calc}
\usepackage{ifthen}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\newsavebox\MyFigBox
\newlength\MyMinFigHeight
\setlength{\MyMinFigHeight}{\paperheight - 8\baselineskip}

% Like \includefigure:
\newcommand\myincludefigure[2][]{%
	\savebox{\MyFigBox}{\includegraphics[#1]{#2}}%
	\ifthenelse{%
		\lengthtest{%
			\heightof{\usebox{\MyFigBox}}}%
			<%
			\MyMinFigHeight%
		}%
	}{%
		\vspace{%
			\real{0.5}*%
			{ \MyMinFigHeight - \heightof{\usebox{\MyFigBox}} }%
		}%
		\usebox{\MyFigBox}%
		\vspace{%
			\real{0.5}*%
			{ \MyMinFigHeight - \heightof{\usebox{\MyFigBox}} }%
		}%
	}{%
		\usebox{\MyFigBox}%

Subject: [texhax] selecting chapters from book through dviselect
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0403290923020.5984-100000@pcct700.ct.infn.it>

Hi,

I am writing my class notes using book.cls. I would like to make its
chapters available to my students as separate PDF files. Since I wasn't
able to use dvipdfm to select individual chapters (dvips does a kind of
the same with sections, whereas dvipdfm does not), I tried using
dviselect, but to no avail.

Dviselect actually looks at the \count variables used by TeX. From the log
file produced by latex, it seems that \count80 is reserved by book.cls to
chapter numbers (\c@chapter=\count80). However, dviselect's man-page
states that dviselect actually makes use of the ten count variables that
TeX uses.

Is there any (safe) way to map \count80 onto a lesser \count, so that it
can be exploited by dviselect?

Any other general suggestion concerning my problem?

Thank you all in advance.

Giuseppe.

i wouldn't bother.

the faq answer:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=conditional

doesn't even consider dviselect (___old___ technology).  since you're
using book class, i'ld go for the simplest of them all, \includeonly

the one significant problem is that out-of-chapter references are going
to dangle ... but that's going to happen whatever solution you choose:
it's implicit in your chosen procedure.  (i think your procedure is
sound, i merely want to point out this slight irritation.)

Thanks, Phil.

I tried that already (i.e., using pstopdf, which is a script file invoking 
gs with various options), but characters look then quite fuzzy. That's why 
I prefer dvipdfm to pstopdf.

I read there is a specific option for GS to have fonts embedded in the PDF
file, although this results in a slightly larger PDF file. I tried that as
well, but didn't work on my system.

I am aware of that solution, but that would imply editing the latex file 
once for each chapter, and adjusting the arguments of \includeonly 
accordingly.

I am rather looking for an automated procedure (e.g. through a Makefile),
that I can use each time I make a correction or an addition to my notes,
if you see what I mean.

I know it's ... not straightforward, but I'm even thinking of making latex
print out the first and last page numbers of each chapter in a separate
aux/log file, and then using these with dviselect. (It certainly works
with selecting a given page range.)

Thanks you all for your precious suggestions.

transform them to pdf with dvipdf, the quality of the
pdf document is very low - the very letters are not
drawn clearly and distinctly and are hard to read.
Please, suggest me how can I improve the quality of
pdf.
I am using Red Hat Linux 8.0.

Kind Regards 
Ivan Ivanov

P.S. However, when I use dvips, the ps file is of
excllent quality and it read very easy. So I tried to
transform the ps file to pdf with ps2pdf and also
tried pdflatex, but the pdf is still very bad.

Hi everybody,
 
I have one small doubt. Tracking is possible in LaTeX?
 
Thanks in advance.

Sadly yes.

Virtual fonts make it easy, or one can use the ``soul'' package (space 
out and underlining) available from CTAN, http://www.ctan.org

Recently there was a rather lengthy discussion on TeX's capabilities on 
the website Slashdot.

If you're not put off by vulgarity and idle threats look at, 
``http://www.slashdot.org'' ``Adobe Kills Framemaker for the Mac'' --- 
probably you won't see anything too objectionable as long as you browse 
at comments moderated to at least 1.

http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/24/1512211

The bottom line is TeX is a programming language, and the only limits 
to what it can do are human ingenuity, processing power / time 
tradeoffs, system limitations (my current project is running up against 
a filesystem size limitation, the host OS can't make files larger than 
512MB) and one's ability to make such resources available.

William
(who was considering a presentation, ``Debunking the myths of TeX'' 
based on the above discussion ;)

Hello, 

I tried to figure out how I can name my problem but the easiest way is to 
paste my latex code rather than trying to verbalize it. 

so far I did:

text ...... \cite{Potter:2003} computed net primary productivity (NPP) by

\begin{center}

NPP = $S_r FPAR e_{max} T W$ \footnotesize{\citep{Potter:2003}}

\end{center}

 where 
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item[ ]$S_r$ = solar radiance
 \item[ ]FPAR = fraction of absorption of photosynthetically active radiation
 \item[ ]$e_{max}$ = constant light utilisation efficiency term
 \item[ ]T = temperature
 \item[ ]W = moisture \citep{Potter:2003}
 \end{itemize}

I would like to have the "where" in the same line as the first item. I tried 
various ways like \begin{flushleft} etc. but that does not work either. 

any idea how to do this? thanks in advance cheers Martin

Blank lines indicate the beginning of a new paragraph.

Either use \noindent before where or do something like:

\end{center}
%
  where
%
  \begin{itemize}

The second % may not be necessary.

thanks for your reply, but I deleted or % all blank lines and used \noindent 
but both did not work to move "where" to the same line as the first 
\item[]$S_r$=solar radiance.

could it be that \begin{itemize} interferes with this approach and forces the 
first item in a separate line?

The following worked for me:

  ...
  \end{center}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \item[where ]$S_r$ = solar radiance
  \item[ ]FPAR = fraction of absorption of photosynthetically active 
    radiation
  ...
  \end{itemize}

I'm not completely sure what you want.  Is it
 
where        *  $S_r$ = solar radiance
             *  FPAR = fraction of absorption of photosynthetically
                active radiation
             *  $e_{max}$ = constant light utilisation efficiency term
 
If so, you might try putting  where  and the itemized list in minipages.
 
Good luck, Wes

Rafael managed to read and understand what you wrote --- I misread it 
and assumed you wanted everything lined up in a column (guess I read 
aligned for ``a line'').

My apologies.

Putting things in minipages or in some other set of boxes which'll top 
align will work.

yes, that worked fine, thanks a lot, regards Martin

This is a very, very gross hack, but, if you're in a hurry, I think it does
what you want:

...
\end{center}
where
\parbox[t]{15cm}{\vspace*{-1.5\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize}
\item $S_r$ = solar radiance
\item FPAR = fraction of absorption of photosynthetically active radiation
...
\end{itemize}
}

in them. I visited the www.tug.org site to see how I can do it, but it 
wasn't of much help to me.

I am having problem with drawing tables and including images in the .PDF

Any help in this regard would be appreciated.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Message-ID: <200403302253.i2UMrFi01356@f7.net>

I have released version 3.6 of modes.mf. You can get it by anonymous ftp from

	ftp://tug.org/tex/modes.mf

and shortly from any CTAN site in /tex-archive/fonts/modes/modes-3.6.mf.
See http://www.ctan.org/ for a list of CTAN mirrors and other information

News:
- new landscape definitions, so all non-square devices have landscape
  modes: newddl, epstypml, lviewl, phasertl.
- new mode dpdfezzz, 8000dpi for use with dvips -Ppdf.
- new modes for the HP LaserJet 2100T, StyleWriter II, and Xerox Phaser
  6200DP.

As always, thanks to the many contributors, and further additions and
improvements are welcome.  Please send bug reports or suggestions to
tex-fonts@math.utah.edu (email tex-fonts-request to join).


General information:

modes.mf is a collection of Metafont mode_def's.  It also makes common
definitions for write/white printers, `special' information, and
landscape mode.  It uses up too much memory for the table sizes in the
original mf.web, so you either have to increase the sizes (has been done
in Web2c) or rename the file and remove unneeded modes.  I don't
understand mf.web well enough to understand how to make the modes use
less memory; if some Metafont hacker can tell me, I'd like to hear it.

If you have mode_def's which are not listed below, or corrections to the
existing ones, please send them to me.  Improvements to the exposition,
particularly in how to create a new mode_def, are also welcome.

Version each chapter (\usepackage{version}) in addition to \chapter'ing.
Then `grep` to collect all versions, and invoke LaTeX with a different
\includeversion each time (you can put a LaTeX statement as the first
argument to `latex`).

Your problem is very unclear. Are you just asking how to include graphics? Or 
do you have a specific problem with a special case (I don't understand the 
part "...until the .DVI phase" ) ? And what's wrong with your tables, can you 
provide an example?

When you visited the TUG site, you seem to have missed the
  http://www.tug.org/begin.html
page. Read through some works in the section "Online (La)TeX Documentation"
for an introduction, and the "TeX FAQ" (the part with the "Look here first." 
at the end) for specifics. You may also want to obtain / check out general 
books on TeX / LaTeX.

Bye,

  Benjamin

I suspect the problem is some combination of using PS specials, not 
telling pdftex to generate pdf output or a broken Ghostscript.

A minimal working example would be necessary to guess any more.

Subject: [texhax] Landscape Mode
Message-ID: <003001c41740$68292810$f0c08e45@bob>


    I would like to have some of my document in landscape mode. Therefore, I
checked the FAQ and found that the lscape package should do the job. Here is
a simple LaTeX file that I tried:

\documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{article}
\usepackage{pst-node}
\usepackage{longtable}
\usepackage{lscape}
\title {A Heuristic for Coloring Graphs}
\author{Robert~Sherry}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{landscape}
Test Line
\end{landscape}
\end{document}


I would expect the line: Test Line to be written vertical instead of
horizontal. However, it is not. Could somebody please help?
