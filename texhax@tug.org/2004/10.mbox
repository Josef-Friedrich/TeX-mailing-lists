you know, call me a newbie, but i'm not too clear on the difference.  i
know that latex is just tex with a buch of macros already defined, but i
dont really know the difference.

maybe if someone can sum them up, i'd learn that tex would be good enough.

to add, i could write my own in latex, but most of what i do is articles
and papers, and i suspect that if i just wrote it in article class, it
would not be the most efficient way to go about it.  that's why i ask for
some models.

thanks again,

bobby

thus far you're right.

the typeset documented source, with indexes, comes to something in the
order of 700pp of a4.  a convenient summing-up might be "they're
pretty complicated".  which really isn't enough; learning tex is a
good precursor of learning how to duplicate the functionality of
latex, but latex has a lot of useful structures embedded in it that
are useful stuff for the knowledgeable programmer.

a self-confessed newbie is well-advised to look for examples.  but, as
when i was starting (pre-ctan[*], on my simple problem of memorandum
macros) there don't seem to me to be any publicly-available examples
of syllabus macros.  so you're stuck with doing a deeper search than i
have (i just used http://www.tex.ac.uk/CTANfind.html), or ploughing
ahead on your own.

[*] when i started there wasn't any www, either; to look further than
i have, i would suggest google (or whatever).

There is another way of looking at this : LaTeX carries with it
an enormous amount of "excess baggage" which most users neither
need nor understand.  I have yet to find anything which LaTeX
can do that cannot be done using Plain TeX plus additional
(custom) macros created specifically for the task in hand.

or to put it another way, plain tex is far better for the expert who
has no need of helping anyone else.  custom macros for simple tasks
are usually simple ... yet i've been at a presentation given by phil
where he recounted some piece of maths macro programming he had done
in plain tex.  i don't actually remember what he had programmed, but
(a priori) it didn't seem a particularly big deal.  yet towards the
end, when he got to the final ironing-out of the final bug, the
audience broke into spontaneous applause ... and that before the
"conclusion" section of the talk :-)

yes, latex carries baggage for a lot of things that i never once used
all that time i was writing letters using it, to be read to my blind
grandmother.  yet it enabled me to adjust the sizes aand faces of the
fonts in those letters until we had found a good size for her
partially-sighted friend to read them to her, with ease.  sure, there
are font selection packages for plain tex, but they're baggage that
most plain users would rather avoid.

just remember that latex is often the minimum-thought alternative[*]
to cobbling together macros in a language you barely understand.  and
realise that many people aren't as clever as phil.

robin

[*] or, one such alternative.  there is another excellent candidate,
now: context -- even larger, even more baggage, but arguably better
suited to the simple needs of everyday use.  i don't participate in
such arguments, since i don't know context particularly well, but it's
clear that it's a pretty fine piece of work.

... I just thought of another thing (I'll stop now, honest).

Fedora comes with this thing called "prelink" which speeds up program
execution by storing relocation information in advance.  I'm not sure
how much I approve of that (it's rare that I find I need to save 0.001
seconds of the execution of a program, I must admit), but anyway this
needs write access to /usr in order to work.  It seems to be scheduled

Just to add to Robin's remarks (with which I whole-heartedly agree), as one
example (among many) I use the "beamer" package for presentations.  Now I'd
consider myself pretty well up on TeX and LaTeX (I wrote my own citation and
cross-referencing macros in TeX long before the advent of LaTeX).  However,
to sit down from scratch and do anything even vaguely resembling what I got
out of beamer after a few minutes playing with the examples would take an
absolute age.  The point is obviously that some, like I once did, do indeed
enjoy playing with TeX and writing purpose-built macros and tweaking and so
on - but not everyone! - and I, for one, am pretty tired of it these days
and would much rather spend my time doing real research.

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

well, i guess that doesnt really answer my question.  but my question was
two parted.

one, what's the difference between tex and latex.  if its simple, i
suppose i  could use tex.  i know enough about latex to know that if i
follow the rules, put all the code in the right place, do a
latex document.tex
that it'll spit me out a .dvi that looks like i want.  And i dont know
much else.

second part was "Hi, i'm about to make my syllabus for next semester, does
anyone use latex for this job?  and if so, can I see your .tex file so i
can use it as a guide?"  what i actually did was google for syllabus.tex
and got about 20 of them, so i'll be fine either way.  Just thought
someone might have something they're proud of, or a bit of explicit
knowledge they'd like to share.

I'm not sure the original question has been answered well.

How about just to say that TeX is all about putting letters on pages
and LaTeX is all about putting paragraphs into documents?  

TeX is designed to make typesetting work well.  It knows how to
justify a paragraph and set an equation, but that's about as
high-level as it gets.  You don't ask for a heading in TeX, you just
make the type bigger or bold.

LaTeX is designed to help structure documents, by making its markup
"functional", which is to say you mark the function of a piece of
text: it's a section heading, a marginal note, a list element, or
whatever.  In a separate place (class definitions like article.cls or
style files like times.sty) there are definitions of what these
elements are to look like.  This is the essential insight of the
design of HTML and XML, too, though LaTeX predates them.

In other words, if you want to write articles, and spend time on their
content instead of their look, use LaTeX.  If you want to change the
look dramatically, you can do it by hacking together new LaTeX styles,
which can easily be based on old ones, with modifications.  For doing
this, it helps to know a little TeX.

As far as overhead goes, the choice can make a difference, that is if
you care that your document processes in two seconds instead of three.

With respect, I disagree.  If you are using TeX properly (as opposed
to using it naively), then you most certainly /do/ "ask for a heading
in TeX".  Whether you do this through

	\Heading {...}

		or

	\Begin {Heading} ... \End {Heading}

		or

	<H1> ... </H1>

is entirely up to you (I use the last form, but that's just a personal
preference).  It is then your responsibility, as the TeX user /cum/
programmer, to ensure that

	\Heading or \Begin ... \End or <H1> ... </H1>

is appropriately defined and robust.

What LaTeX does is to provide such commands /without/ requiring
that you define them for yourself.  Unfortunately it does so
in such a way that if you /like/ how it typesets headings,
then it's fine; if you /dislike/ how it typesets them, then
it can be pretty tedious (and difficult) to work out how to
make them look good to you.

On the other hand, if you choose to define

	\Heading or \Begin ... \End or <H1> ... </H1>

for yourself, using a (Plain) TeX environment, then you will not
only know, a priori, what the typeset heading will look like,
you will also know exactly how to change your definition if
you would prefer it to look different.

TeX v. LaTeX is basically horses for courses; if you like LaTeX,
and like the results it produces, then use it; if you dislike LaTeX,
or dislike the results it produces, then define your own high-level
markup and use that instead.  But don't /ever/ write something like

	\topglue 1,0 true in
	\leftline {\font \thisfont = cmbx12 scaled \magstep 4 \thisfont My very first heading!}
	\vskip 0,2 in
	\leavevmode \hskip 0,3 in And this is my very first paragraph.
	\par
	\end

because that is the very worst of both worlds ...

Like you and others, I have programmed extensively in TeX (indeed, I
found one of the more obscure bugs in TeX, and possibly the most obscure
bug of all in the TeXbook). The difficulty with your suggestion for most
people (that anyone who doesn't like LaTeX output should use TeX instead
and write macros) is that even fairly basic stuff - like an automatic
equation-numbering and cross-referencing macro - that is essential for
elementary scientific writing is rather difficult.

    like an automatic

As long as it's come up ... these two particular features (and a few
other similar things) are in Eplain (http://tug.org/eplain), a macro
package I wrote a long time ago.  A few people who like to format stuff
themselves still find it useful.

LaTeX is certainly the majority favorite, and for good, reason, but it's
nice to have a choice.

Could you put a copy of the .pdf on a site somewhere?

My suspicion is your setup at work has some untoward aspect, either a 
buggy PS RIP, or a version of Adobe Acrobat set to use local fonts or 
something.

An alternative here would be to set up using Times .pfb files instead 
of the URW clone.

In section 2.6 of Kopka & Daly's book, they state that "The issue of 
fragile commands ... with LaTeX2e has become of academic interest: all 
commands that are likely to be used in moving arguments are now robust." I 
recently discovered that this isn't true: \nolinebreak is not robust and

\caption{Blah blah ... blah\nolinebreak\ blah blah blah}

fails rather dismally. This can of course be avoided with \protect, but 
should \nolinebreak be instead made robust?

I'd say it is not worth the trouble because the effect is easier to get  
with \nobreakspace or its shorthand ~ because \nobreakspace happens to be  
robust. Unless you want to use the optionl argument of \nolinebreak of  
course.

If you still want to make it robust, simply(?) add

\makeatletter
\DeclareRobustCommand*\nolinebreak{\@testopt\@no@lnbk4}
\makeatother

to your preamble. It takes up an extra command name (robust commands make  
a secret command that does the real typesetting) but that doesn't matter  
much nowadays.

You can do everything in latex what you can do in tex.  latex is just
an extension to tex.  Of course, you can do everything in tex what you
can do in latex, but don't underestimate the amount of time you need
to implement some of latex's features in plain tex.

You say:

It seems that you are quite familiar with latex.  Though I generally
agree with Robin that Context is better in some respects, it is
certainly advantageous to make use of the knowledge you already have.

If you search for latex files, just search for syllabus.sty and
syllabus.cls as well.

Maybe it's better to ask at comp.text.tex (a newsgroup) also because
there are much more people listening.

If you do not find a macro package which does what you need, I fear
that you have to describe your problem exactly.  It is also useful to
know which operating system you use.  UNIX systems provide a lot of
tools.  Though it is more elegant to program everything in tex, it's
sometimes easier to write a small script which produces tex code.

  Reinhard

that will be killed by the infinite stretchability in \@fptop and

I would be very surprised if LaTeX did not
do what you want automatically : Knuth provided
\abovedisplayshortskip for that very purpose,
and it seems very unlikely (though not impossible)
that Leslie Lamport et al would not have carried
that functionality over into LaTeX.

Ah, it does!  Just not enough for my taste (I guess I favor half a

It does. A problem might be either accidentally starting a new paragraph 
just before the equation or using one of the amsmath envs for oneliners 
(sadly envs such as align or gather are full display envs and doesn't look 
at the text line just above. Example (the change in spacing can be sees 
in the vertical distance between the 'text's):

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
\noindent text
\[
a=b
\]
text
\begin{displaymath}
a=b
\end{displaymath}
text
$$
a=b
$$
text
\begin{equation*}
a=b
\end{equation*}
text
\begin{align*}
a=b
\end{align*}
text
\begin{gather*}
a=b
\end{gather*}

Alexandru is not being very informative here but my best guess is that he  
is talking about the multi line display environments from Ams(La)TeX. They  
all insert \abovedisplayskip above every display and the reason is quite  
simple: they're all built on the structure

   $$
   \halign{...}
   $$

where TeX by nature puts the \halign flush left. Just last week I made  
some extensions to the amsmath code that solves the problem (using  
\predisplaysize, \displayindent, and a lot of the information stored by  
amsmath for it's typesetting phase). If these fixes become a part of the  
next major amsmath release it'll definitely be as an option as the  
backwards compatibility is gone... Guess I should mail them to the Ams  
soon then.

Ah, fine : in that case, try adjusting \abovedisplayshortskip :
it /might/ be as simple as that, but there's a pretty severe
risk that LaTeX itself sets the primitive on entering a display,
so simple tweaking won't necessarily help ...

Thanks for all your replies.

Let me clarify a bit:  I was actually referring to regular math 
display, not necessarily to align* etc.  True, something does happen.  
But I guess my taste is a bit more extreme even than 
\abovedisplayskip=0pt:  I would favor a value of -.5\baselineskip, 
bringing it up a bit.

Indeed, if you have <full-text-line1> / <short-text-line> / 
<lil'-math-display> / <full-text-line2>, then the display sits 
essentially between the two <full-text-line>'s, with a whole extra 
\baselineskip gap on top.  Thus, better to average with 
-.5\baselineskip, to my taste.

I think I am bound to do these things by hand, especially as a really 
nice output depends on a lot of factors, like percentage of fullness 
for all lines involved, as well as tricky cases such as when you have a 
math display like:  <stuff> = <Matrix>, where <stuff> appears under the 
end of <short-text-line>, but the <Matrix> sits under the previous 
<full-text-line1>:  it is nice then to lift it up, again.  Indeed, 
all-in-all I find myself using all sorts of fractions of \baselineskip 
to get what I like...

I guess all this is simply some sort of wish list, maybe somebody 
proficient in the finer points of TeX might enjoy doing something about 
it...  After all, people get excited (incl. me) about all sorts of 
microtypographical finesse, like character protruding/marging kerning 
and font expansion, while the math display remains, in my humble 
opinion, somewhat rudimentary.

BTW:  Is there a reasonably accessible mechanism through which I could 
hook up into the bowels of TeX's decision between \abovedisplayskip / 
\abovedisplayshortskip?  A good way to compare superpositions / line 
fullness, etc?

The situation in which this arose was in fact an equation: e.g. $0 <
\nolinebreak x < 1$. Using \nobreakspace is therefore not an option,
unfortunately. Using DeclareRobustCommand, or just using \protect as a
one-off, is OK; but it would be nicer for \nolinebreak to be robust in
the first place, because nowadays people don't expect to have to deal
with fragile commands. The error messages which result from the
\nolinebreak problem are not very informative, of course, so it takes a
while to track the problem down!

yeah it could be a simple local issue in this printer. Just feeding my latex file into a sed
command that transforms fi into f{}i, in order to suppress ligatures, and
that's it.

The test below is a nice example (Acrobat reader gives it nicely on the
screen but fuzzy ligatured word on paper).

Thanks anyway, and all the best with Latex.

Good Sebastian,

I hope someone has given you a satisfactory answer already.  Otherwise,
the sample cv demonstrates subrubrics that have proper multi-line
entries.  Are you using some box-ing command?  Or is the problem with
the length of title's text?  One quick solution that should work in
almost all problems with left-to-right mode is to use a
\parbox{width}{text} or, in some circumstances, a minipage environment.
For both of these, though, you need to calculate the width of the
multi-line text yourself.

Good luck,

Dear Karl, Didier, and Pavel,

Thank you all for your help with this issue. It looks like \parbox'ing the 
subrubrics is the way to go for my current purpose.

Pavel, the sample file you sent didn't arrive at my end, so would you mind 
sending it again, perhaps off-list (not sure whether it has to do with the 
List server).

All the best,
Sebastian

In that case you can simply place braces around the bits in which you
don't want a linebreak. ${0<x}<1$

This line:
	\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzc}{m}{it}%
              {<-> s * [0.900] pzcmi7t}{}
from the FAQ is the one that reduces the size to 90%, through the

the faq has two .fd extracts (as it were).  the second one

\DeclareFontFamily{OT1}{pzc}{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzc}{m}{it}%
             {<-> s * [0.900] pzcmi7t}{}
\DeclareMathAlphabet{\mathscr}{OT1}{pzc}%
                                 {m}{it}

gives you zapf chancery at 90% of its designed size.  i used that
value when writing the answer because it's what someone told me; it's
plainly easy to try alternative factors.

That's no good because it removes the stretchability from the spaces in
{0<x} whilst leaving them in <1. If the line gets stretched when it is
justified, the spacing in the equation might end up being very poor.

But in any case, my real point is not whether there are alternatives to
using \protect\nolinebreak, but that an average user is unlikely to
realise that he needs to \protect the \nolinebreak in the first place;
and the error message if he doesn't \protect it is less than helpful.

Anyway, thanks for the various suggestions...

However typing
     ! Argument of \@caption has an extra }.
in Google gives you the FAQ answer as the very first hit.

> Anyway, thanks for the various suggestions...


As eTeX is the base for future LaTeX delevopment, it might be worth  
considering using \protected for stuff like this. Using the definition
     \makeatletter
     \protected\def\nolinebreak{\@testopt\@no@lnbk4}
     \makeatother
works of course.

One has to think carefully which commands should be robust and which not.  
\ref for instance must not be robust (not that it has stopped babel from  
doing it anyway).

Let me answer \ref first. \ref isn't fragile, rather it is completely  
expandable (in the non-babel case) which is quite important.

\documentclass{book}
\makeatletter
\DeclareRobustCommand\ref[1]{%
   \expandafter\@setref\csname r@#1\endcsname\@firstoftwo{#1}}
\makeatother
\begin{document}
\section{Test of reference: \ref{test}}\label{test}
\end{document}

Try running this document and observe that the reference doesn't work in  
the header. The reason is \MakeUppercase acts on the text in the header  
but as \ref is robust and thus still appears as \ref{test} it is converted  
to upper case and then executed later on.

The reason for not robustifying commands from the get go had to do with  
speed and memory. Quoting David Carlisle (comp.text.tex on 2000/01/24):

   In the beginning, when latex had to fit on a 1/2 Meg PC and it took
   about 15 minutes per page to run a typical document, it was worth the
   saving of a bit of space and a bit of time to leave commands fragile.

   Now, it's not so clear:-)

Now we have \protected from eTeX which makes it easier on the memory  
because it doesn't take up two strings for each user command. One day  
maybe even \raisebox will be robust, but to be fair, it's not exactly one  
of those commands you use directly in section headings and captions, is it?

Actually, funny thing, it is.  I don't like how TeX typesets 
subscripts, especially when the subscript is a capital (as in, say, F_A 
or \nabla_A), and so I redesigned it by lowering it, and, sometimes, 
bringing it closer to its `parent' (especially since, say, F and \nabla 
are rather empty on the lower side).  I used \raisebox for that, and 
then had surprises...

Speaking of \protect, how does one look into the bowels of a protected 
command?  Case in point:  I' happily running latex on command line and 
using \show to dig into definitions of various uglies, but whenever I 
hit a \protect'ed command, as in \show\command, I get \protect\command. 
  What should I do to to move further in decyphering these?

\DeclareRobustCommand\foo{bar} defines two commands: "\foo"  and "\foo ".  
Yes that's right, the last one has a space in it. "\foo" expands to  
"\protect\foo " and "\foo " contains the real definition. You can see it  
by doing a
      \expandafter\show\csname foo \endcsname

The idea of making robust commands the way they are is phenomenally good  
(Alan Jeffrey got the idea circa 10 years ago IIRC). One reason it is so  
brilliant is that it allows the command in question to be repeatedly  
written to files and still appear the same to LaTeX.

  ... but have you tried simple coding, such as:

   F_{\!A}^{}  and  \nabla_{\!\!A}^{}

Little-known fact:
   The blank superscript ^{} forces the subscript a bit lower.

Similarly a blank subscript _{}  adjusts the position of a superscript.

replace openright with openany (the book more or less behaves like
report) in the list of options for the documentclass

The white pages you talk about are automatically inserted (if necessary) so that every new chapter begins on an odd (right) page.
That's what the "openright" option you used is for!

If you don't need them, probably you are printing a one side document, than you should use the "oneside" option.

4TeX has a spell checker that should be easily integrated into whatever
edit-latex cycle you are using (I'm afraid I'm not familiar with TeXmaker
though).

When I try to compile, TeX goes into an infinite loop.  Not that I've
waited long enough to confirm it's infinite, but it's long, and more
to the point, silent:

The log is not more informative.  Is there something about re-using a
box that I'm not understanding?  This works fine if I \unvbox a
different box than the one I \setbox, so it isn't the commands
themselves that aren't working, but somehow \setboxing a box right
after I've \unvboxed it in an \output routine is a problem.  Can
anyone tell me what I've done wrong here?

Many thanks,

Firstly, don't you want here either:

   \global\output\expandafter{\the\IN@output ... }

or simply just

   \global\output{\the\IN@output ... }

since \IN@output  is constant, so expanding it can
be delayed until you are actually going to use it.


Secondly, your use of \unvbox  places material back onto
the vertical-list, every time the \output routine is called
(except perhaps for the first time).
Hence TeX will *always* think that there is more work to do.

In short, you have created an algorithm for which the stopping
criterion is never satisfied. Hence it keeps looping through
the \output, never able to stop...

But it's actually a little more complicated than this, in that LaTeX's
own \output routine (which you use as \IN@output) actually gets caught
in a loop, trying to clear out the new stuff.
This prevents TeX from ever getting to \shipout anything.

It looks like you are trying to place constant material on every page,
by having the \output routine from the previous page place it there.
Apart from the logical flaw in this approach, whereby TeX can never
finish, working with \output  routines in this way is *very* tricky.

It's much easier to redefine \shipout to position the new material
as a box of zero size. This is what the  {everyshi}  package does.
Have you tried this ?
Is there a reason that isn't suitable for your needs ?

Probably you're right here.  My way does work, but it would be
neater your way.

If I remove the \setbox line, I can add boxed material in the text and
it appears on the top of the following page with no trouble: no
infinite loop, and the pages look fine.  If I follow the 
\unvbox with a \setbox to the now-empty box, I get an infinite loop.
If I leave in the \setbox and remove the \unvbox, the looping goes
away, too.  (And so does the Hola!)

I had thought that \unvbox emptied the box and it was now available to
use again.  I also thought that \setbox wouldn't add anything to the
vertical list.  But apparently the interaction is more subtle than I'd
thought, or at least it is in an \output routine, and I can't see how
or why.  Which is my problem.

Quite right, it is.  This is why I've found myself consulting the list.

The everyshi package lets you put material on the page you just
finished.  This is good, but if the material you want to place
requires that you had already left extra room on that page to do it,
everyshi doesn't help you.

Many thanks,

Try it this way...

  \makeatletter
  \newbox\IN@topfig
  \newbox\IN@topfiga

  \def\cleartopfig{\global\setbox\IN@topfig\copy\voidb@x}
  \def\settopfig{\global\setbox\IN@topfig \vbox{\hbox{Hola!}}}

  \newtoks\IN@output
  \global\IN@output\expandafter{\the\output}
  \global\output{\the\IN@output
     \ifvoid\IN@topfig\else
       \unvbox\IN@topfig \settopfig
     \fi
   }
  \makeatother

Then use  \settopfig  in your document body (or preamble)
to start the column-header, and don't forget to
   \cleartopfig
at the end --- else it will not end at all.

I tried playing with the  \outputpenalty ,
before devising the above variant on your coding.

Fair comment.

Hopefully the above helps.
Like you, I'm not sure why it has such a radically
different result to what you were trying.

Message-ID: <20041011212725.GA4125@debian>

Hello!

When using floatflt package, I'm have good results with the following :

\begin{floatingfigure}[l]{50mm}{
  \begin{center}
  %\epsfig{file=IMG3773,width=3cm}
  \includegraphics[height=3cm]{IMG}
  \end{center}}
\end{floatingfigure}

However,I would like to have a picture wrapped into the middle of text (ie
picture centered in the page), not sticked on one boarder of the page. The pdf explanation of this package does not gives a kind of c option.

Also I tried picins package, but I could only get 
\parpic{\includegraphics[height=3cm]{IMG}} 
to work properly, and this gives identical results.

Does anyone know how to handle picins for this (x and y offsets) ? Otherwise, Any alternative that does the trick would be great !

Cheers!

Steph

Hi Team,
 
Please advise how to break a long table automatically when it flows from
one page to another. Also, please let us know if there is any package
and sample file available to achieve this. The longtable.sty package
breaks them but does not work for two column mode.
 
Please also suggest if there is a package or way available to
automatically break long display equation in LaTeX.
 
Looking forward to an early response in this regard.

Message-ID: <20041015081734.GA2822@saphor.net>

Hi!

For a critical edition I need to print footnotes as letters, beginning
at "a" and going up to "z", then restarting at "a". The letter "j"
must, for some arcane reasons, not be used. In the base data,
originating from an XML source, the footnotes are numbers sequentially
from 1 to 4000. Each footnote number appear repeatedly to mark
extensions.

My naive idea to handle that problem in TeX was the following:

-----------------

\newcount\footnotecounter
\newcount\footnotetmp
\def\lettercounter#1{\message{#1}\footnotecounter=#1
  \footnotetmp=\footnotecounter
  \divide\footnotetmp by 25 
  \multiply\footnotetmp by 25 
  \advance\footnotecounter by -\footnotetmp

  \ifnum\footnotecounter < 25 \message{hallo}\fi

  \ifcase\footnotecounter \or a\or b\or
  c\or d\or e \or f \or g \or h \or i \or k \or l \or m \or n \or o
  \or p \or q \or s \or t \or u \or v \or w \or x \or y \or z\fi}

-----------------

In other words, I want to calculate modulo 25 and then pick the appropriate letter.

However, I get in the log:

1 hallo 1 hallo 2 hallo 2 hallo 2 hallo 2 hallo 3 hallo 3 hallo 4 hallo 4 hallo
5 hallo 5 hallo 6 hallo 6 hallo 7 hallo 7 hallo 8 hallo 8 hallo 9 hallo 9
hallo 9 hallo 10 hallo 10 hallo 9 hallo

                                                  \FootnotetextA{\lettercoun...

Why is TeX's capacity exceeded?

My TeX is extremely rusty these days, so please excuse in advance if
the answer should be trivial. I studied the register section of TeX
for the Impatient, to no avail, but I may well have overlooked the
obvious.

Thanks!

Marc

P. S.: Is there any less roundabound way to calculate the modulo in
(La-)TeX than this?

oh.  i'd noted that down as something to comment on, but hadn't
imagined it would cause the problem.

the other issue i'd noted was that you're reducing \footnotecounter to
the range 0..24, and then doing a case statement that selects 1..25

i think you need to decrement \footnotecounter by 1 at the start of
the calculation, and to remove the initial \or in your case statement.

Message-ID: <3565FBF4-1ECB-11D9-AF53-000393955C52@mac.com>

Just some notes from a newbie.

Background: Downloaded LyX which had me download and install 
i-installer, which brought me to Gerben's i-Directory at TUG through 
its interface.

After selecting an i-Package name then selecting "Show i-Package 
window" I have noticed something very confusing. All your descriptions 
reveal what a package is, but nothing describes what it does.

Example: "This is Gerben Wierda's binary distribution of Fondu for Mac 
OS X. It has been created by downloading fondu from sourceforge and 
compiling and installing it with make."

My question: What is Fondu and what does it do? Create melted cheese? 
The above quote essentially says that Fondu is Fondu. That's like 
saying a GE2250 is a GE2250. You don't know what a GE2250 is? Too bad! 
Without a clue as to what this and the other applications do, I am 
extremely hesitant to download and install it to my machine. You might 
say "Go to Sourceforge and find out," to which I would reply "Why!" You 
already know the answer, why not tell us? Isn't the sharing of 
information the purpose of an info window -- and the education 
community? A one line paragraph saying, "Fondu is a small application 
designed to melt your font files into useless gibberish," would allow 
me to decide whether the package was something I needed and was worth 
the effort of the download and install.

I understand that you and yours have put a lot of effort into creating 
this gorgeous and excellent interface. I'm just asking for a little 
thought and consideration for the people who are new to the use of your 
software, who are willing to learn and to experiment, but are not 
willing to fill up their multi-thousand dollar machine with unneeded 
utilities.

Just looking out for the average consumer...

You are perfectly right. Thanks for the pointer!

I don't know if you know, but I though I'd let you know:
There a new version (v.2) of AMSLaTeX available to download as
	ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amsltx2.zip

It's funny though that they haven't fixed their \footnote bug, which in 
all AMS classes types the footnote mark in the last size used in math 
mode.
To see it in action, simply typeset
	\documentclass{amsart}
	\begin{document}
	\Huge $G$
	\normalsize Aha\footnote{Wow!}
	\end{document}

Here the fix for it: add to your preamble
	\makeatletter
	\def\@makefnmark{%
		\leavevmode
		\raise.9ex\hbox{\check@mathfonts
	  		\fontsize\sf@size\z@\normalfont%
				\@thefnmark}%
	}
	\makeatother
I think this fix is due to F. Mittelbach.

it looks to me that the release of amslatex that you're talking about
appeared only about a month after your bug report (amslatex/3672, for
the curious).  did you get an acknowledgement from the ams support
people?  (there's no sign that you did, in the database, but i suspect
their acknowledgements don't go through the latex bugs database.)

the release would have been under-way at the time your report came in,
and to add frank's patch (or simply to remove the buggy code so as to
use the working latex default) would have required restarting the
regression testing.  fortunate it's such a counter-intuitive bug,
isn't it?

No complaints.  I just felt chattery today.

I am proud to report that I have seen a few papers on the arXiv which 
suddenly had an oversized footnote mark.

I'd argue that it's not even that hard to run into it in real life:  
Just draw a picture directly in LaTeX and label something there by 
changing sizes, as in:

	\documentclass[12pt]{amsart}
	\begin{document}

	\setcounter{footnote}{49}
	Bug\footnote{whatever}

	\begin{figure}
	\begin{picture}(100,100)
		\put(50,50){\Tiny $\Theta$}
	\end{picture}
	\end{figure}

	\setcounter{footnote}{49}
	Bug\footnote{ooops}

	\end{document}

I'd rather say:  Fortunate that it's usually not very visible. Or that 
people don't draw many pictures in their papers...

Subject: [texhax] automatically broken tables
Message-ID: <200410172113.i9HLDm809412@f7.net>

Suppose I have a reasonably long list, and I want the contents typeset
in N columns of equal width.  And, here's the kicker, I don't want to
have to specify the end-of-rows myself.  Does LaTeX have a package for
this?

For example, using a hypothetical autotable environment:
\begin[3]{autotable}
entry1  \somecommand
entry2  \somecommand
entry3  \somecommand
entry4  \somecommand
entry5  \somecommand
\end{autotable}

would output something like:

entry1        entry2        entry3
entry4        entry5

I don't care what \somecommand is, \> or \\ or \foobar or whatever.  The
point is that it's the same command on each line.

This idea eases maintaining changeable lists, since you don't have to
manually update the intercolumn/interrow commands when the list changes.

Paul Abrahams and I wrote a variant of such a thing for Eplain
(\makecolumns), but I haven't been able to find an equivalent for LaTeX
despite much searching, online and otherwise.  (The Eplain code would be
difficult to cast into a LaTeX context.)  I feel sure it's out there,
though.

Help?

Thanks,

I don't know if this fits but the memoir class has a \autorows macro, 
though it just typesets a list of entries.

See the memoir manual page 170.

what should i look for in order to get a bibliography at the end of every
chapter (containing the refs for only that chapter)?  i THINK the default 
is at the end of the document.

i tried putting \begin{thebibliography} at the end of each chapter, but it
contains the entire bibliography.

hi,

Thanks for so fast reply, i have tried it and it works... but in a 
diferent way of what i'm looking for, it organizes the references so 
that they appear in the bibliography like this:

[3]
[22]
[9]
[12]
[1]
...

just in the order as they are referenced in the text.

I wanted that those numbers change too, so it would be in order 
(1,2,3,4,...).

Best Regards

Filipe

That's a bit disingenuous given that the full name of this package is 
``Fondu Mac font cli tools''. Any reasonably competent mac-user would 
extrapolate from the ``fond'' portion of the name that it's related to 
manipulating a font's resource forks, and any Unix user will have 
bitter experience with dealing with such files and know that 
specialized tools are necessary to pull things out of the Mac OS 9 and 
earlier proprietary file formats.

_Any_ computer user who has figured out the difference between GUI and 
CLI will know that the latter stands for ``Command Line Interface'' and 
know whether or no they are interested in using such tools.

If you don't know what a tool is, you probably don't need it. If you 
want to find out what it does, well, that's ``an exercise left for the 
reader'' as the academics say, and with today's sophisticated search 
engines is trivial.

The home page for LyX is fairly explicit that all one needs is the 
basic tex setup (which has been simplified into a single unified 
package in deference to newbies).

You are assuming that the person has 20 years of computer experience
like you do.  We don't all have that experience.  The documentation
was not sufficient and self contained.  It assumed too much.  The
person who wrote it should have stepped back and added one or two more
basic sentences.

Hmm.  I've been working with computers on command lines and have not
seen CLI before.  Are you familiar with PCR and RVT?  You should be,
they gathered Nobel prizes!!!

> If you don't know what a tool is, you probably don't need it.

Gee.  I never heard of LaTeX.  I guess I don't need it!  I don't need
Linux, OOo, xv, xfig or gimp either.  Most people have not heard of
these.

This does not solve the problem the person was facing.  He wants to
KNOW what it is without having to run all over the net.  It takes a
bit more work on the part of the person to document it, but allows
someone to know what it does in an instant.

You can never have enough documentation.

Perhaps you would find atchange useful?  Isn't the name obvious?

Have fun with atchange!

you can never write enough documentation.  i'm admittedly slow, but my
output of net-wide published documentation is about 20 lines a week.
why are we all being pilloried for failing to write documentation
about a package hardly any of us use (lyx on macos, aiui -- heck, i've

Sorry Robin, I don't mean to attack you.  That's just an observation
I've made.  As a discipline, I write lots of documentation on my
programs - every variable type, constant procedure and code section
has a comment.  Yet I always find that it is not enough.

So my attitude these days is to accept that and just keep adding to
the documentation and improving it.

BRAVO for your documentation work!

If you're using bibtex then presumably you're aware that you have to make a
choice of style via \bibliographystyle{<style>} with <style> = abbrv, alpha,
plain or unsrt in the basic bibtex usage - unsrt is probably what you want.

You might also want to read btxdoc.dvi, which usually comes with LaTeX
installations.

The order I receive TeXhax postings seems to get more and more random - for
some time I thought Robin really did have a crystal ball as his replies
almost invariably reached me before the original questions.  Right now
though I have a reply to his latest(?) reply (together with the original
posting) but not Robin's.  And very often the orderings are in any case
juggled up - it makes deciding whether to join a thread or not rather odd
affair.

Does anyone else have this strange behaviour?

Can the list manager do anything about it?

Bryan,

Look at the chapterbib package which does what you want. Basically, you
need to put each of your chapters in a separate file and \include (NOT
\input) them into the whole. Each chapter has its own \bibliography
command

THEN you run bibtex on the INDIVIDUAL CHAPTERS (each of which will have
its own .aux file because that's the way \include works), NOT on the
master .tex file.

If this clashes with your other packages you can easily do it yourself
by following the above procedure and then  \input'ting the resulting
.bbl files in their respective chapters. 

So you have a master document with:

\documentclass{book}
% \usepackage{chapterbib}  % if you want; may be a good idea
\begin{document}
\include{ch_intro}
\include{ch_results}
\include{ch_conclusion}
\end{document}

and a file ch_intro.tex which has within it

[blah][blah]
\bibliographystle{unsrt}   % or whatever
\bibliography{bibfile}     % your .bib file(s)
\input{ch_intro.bbl}

or better instead of the last line:

\IfFileExists{ch_intro.bbl}{\input{ch_intro.bbl}}{\typeout{ch_intro.bbl
not found; run "bibtex ch_intro"}}  % remind yourself!!!

This way gives lots of complaints about multiply defined references
(which chapterbib and/or the comments therein might help you avoid), but
it gets the job done.

So you do:

latex master.tex
bibtex ch_intro
bibtex ch_results
bibtex ch_conclusion
latex master.tex
latex master.tex

There are sectionbib options to many bibliography packages (e.g. natbib
and chapterbib) which ensure that the bibliography is treated as a
section in your chapter, and not a new chapter.

Sorry this is a bit on the long side in the way of answer. The short
version is: try the chapterbib package first.

Steve

This was hashed and rehashed on the OS X TeX mailing list a while back.

The problem seems to be in many cases there's so much that people tend 
to ignore it.

The task in question was:

Installing LyX.

There's a web page which tells one what one needs to get to do this, 
and the i-Installer.app description covers this quite well. In the 
course of that, a naive user will see the names of a couple of packages 
which are _not_ germane to the task at hand. The reasonable thing for 
them to do is ignore it, unless their curiousity is piqued in which 
case, there's enough information at hand to allow a person to research 
it.

The alternative is to have Gerben use his valuable time cluttering up 
the readme w/ information which a person who needs a given package will 
already have, and which anyone who is curious about can readily look up.

Robin F. then observed:

And there's already a sufficiency of information for a user to manage 
this.

The wiki (http://wiki.lyx.org/pmwiki.php/LyX/Mac) notes:

Fondu isn't mentioned, and I stand by my contention that _anyone_ who 
needs it can easily figure that out.

    Can the list manager do anything about it?

Sorry, I don't know of any way to control this, per se.

I suggest inspecting the full Received: headers for a couple of the
messages that arrived out of order.  That will show exactly where the
delay(s) occurred.  (If you can't make sense of them, send them to me
off list and I'll take a look.)  For myself, messages usually arrive in
a sane order.

Internet mail does not promise that messages will be delivered in the
order they are sent - any more than any other postal service does, and
IMHO it's futile to try to make it do so.

If you want real-time talk, use an interactive chat service - but you
will get a different group of correspondents.

Allow me to rephrase.

``If you haven't learned what a tool is, you either don't have a 
problem space which said tool bears on, or one hasn't done sufficient 
research on one's problems.''

I can't help with Musi[cx]TeX (sorry), but I can recommend GNU Lilypond
for music typesetting, http://lilypond.org -- if you're on some
variant of Unix.  I don't believe it runs on Windows.

(Lilypond does actually use TeX as the typesetting backend, although this
is invisible to users -- at least after installation.)

Happy musicking,

Actually, it does run on Windows in the Cygwin environment.

Perhaps this would be of interest as well?

If you mean Daniel Taupin I'm afraid he has passed away.

For my part, I've found that I can almost always find an answer to a 
technical question by using http://groups.google.com --- if you don't 
find a previous discussion on a technical problem, it's probably a good 
candidate for a doctoral research project.

musictex (and after it musixtex) are pretty tricky beasts.  there's
musictex documentation to be had in the distribution, which you can
get from ctan macros/musictex, or from the icking archive.

i'm a musician who does a fair bit of tex/latex.  i've written out one
score using musictex (a *long* time ago -- musictex is now obsolete),
and have no intention of doing that again.  most people write musixtex

Hi,

I'm trying to convert some mainframe produced reports into pdf using
pdflatex. These reports contain box drawing glyphs which are not defined in
the standard cp427 encoding shipped with linux (RH8). I've looked all over
but I cannot find an equivalent which includes the characters I need. These
are mainly doublebox glyphs at hex(CE,C9,BA) etc.

Anyone help please.

Is this any different from the old DOS codepage 437 (the subject of
the mail speaks of cp437)? All of the glyphs of CP437 are in the UCS
for sure. A new iconv version should be able to handle such
files. iconv (GNU libc) 2.3.2, the version distributed with debian
testing systems certainly doesn't have any problems to convert these
to UTF-8.

Which fonts support this under TeX is a different question.

Best regards,

Marc

I've been using MusiXTeX for a while now, mainly for typesetting musical

wanting to typeset? I might be able to help with specific questions.

Subject: [texhax] gv maintainer volunteer?
Message-ID: <200410202030.i9KKUSb16751@f7.net>

The previous volunteer (Brett McCoy) for maintaining GV, the
PostScript/PDF previewer based on Ghostscript originally written by
Johannes Plass, hasn't had time to work on it for a year now, and has
said he'd be happy to hand it over.  (Ditto Johannes himself.)

So, would anyone here be interested in taking that job on?  It would be
nice to have it maintained again.

For starters, just making a new release with updated documentation and
framework files would be helpful, since it's been so many years.  I also
have a list of assorted bugs and wishlist items.

Brett set up a project for it at sourceforge (essentially empty).  It
could kept there, or moved to savannah.gnu.org, sarovar.org, whatever.

In the previous round, GV was dubbed a GNU project.  If you'd like to
volunteer to work on gv, but find that problematic, we can undub it.

If you're interested, please let me know.

Thanks,
karl

Try XeTeX under MacOS X, using the Code2000 font.

     http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/xetex
     http://home.att.net/~jameskass/   (for Code2000 and Code2001)

If the Mac can display the font, then XeTeX can typeset with it,
creating a PDF directly.


Hope this helps,

We may still have a minor issue with GPL compatibility... there were 
some widgets, if I recall, that were covered under the X license, but 
the X license has changed since rms dubbed the project a GNU project and 
the widgets in question may no longer be compatible with the GPL.

nar.sty is a snare and a delusion -- it's written for latex 2.09 (it's
actually 16 years old), and as far as i can tell it does nothing for
you that current latex article.cls doesn't do.

nar.bst i've not looked at.

(i'll move nar.sty to the obsolete/ tree tomorrow morning -- can't do
it now -- my wife's already in bed...)

Hmm.  The nar.sty that he is talking about is the one I built and use
(successfully and I just tested it today!):

http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html
and then
ftp://ftp.ncifcrf.gov/pub/delila/nar.sty

I suspect this is not the same file as the one you are looking at.

AH!  But I see that there is a new style:

narfront.cls

that one can get from that page:

ftp://ftp.ncifcrf.gov/pub/delila/narfront.cls

While this does not explain Shibin's original problem (I could not
reproduce it, see http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/bugs.html), it
does give a version more in tune with Nucleic Acids Research.  NAR
might have one of their own by now, but I haven't looked.

indeed it isn't.  i hope the op is listening :-)

however, the "snare and delusion" that i talked about, on ctan,
produces exactly the symptom reported.

i've moved the more recent of the two(!) instances of nar.sty on ctan
to the obsolete/ tree, and deleted the other.

which leaves a slot for you to submit your working version, should you
fancy the idea.  (see http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=uploads)

narfront.cls seems to be an elsevier ripoff; it points at your web

Subject: [texhax] Heading in empty pages after list of figures
Message-ID: <4177E107.2000503@mpip-mainz.mpg.de>

Dear Sir/Madam,

I wrote my thesis using the book document class. Every chapter, the list 
of figures, list of tables, bibliography, etc. start in a new 
odd-numbered page. In order to fulfil this, sometimes a page is left 
empty at the end of one chapter, list of figs, etc. However, those pages 
have the headings of the previous chapter, list of figs, etc.

I managed to remove the headings at the end of the chapters by simply 
using \thispagestyle{plain}, but this does not work in the cases of the 
list of figs, list of tables and bibliography.

Any suggestion??


Many thanks in advance,

Fernando Stefani

Trouble is, it is one of many on my page.  I'd have to got through
them carefully.  Maybe in 5 years?  Anyone who would like to do these
is welcome to (some have seeped into CTAN).  They are biology related
files.

That's right - I probably got it from elsevier and modified it so it
worked correctly.  Documentation about what I did should be inside the
file.  So it wouldn't be official.

Message-ID: <85947EB2-24A3-11D9-8325-000393BC23DC@math.ufl.edu>

Suggestion for some small improvements for xfrac with mathpazo:

1. Adjust spacing when \sfrac is used under \boldsymbol (which might be 
not be the best way to get the virgule/solidus to be bold, but seems to 
work).  I'dd add \mkern2mu to the numerator, see example below.

2. Make \sfrac work under \bm.  The example below produces an error.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{mathpazo}
\usepackage{xfrac}
\usepackage{amsbsy}
\usepackage{bm}
\begin{document}

\[ \boldsymbol{\sfrac{11}{11}\
	\bm{\sfrac{11}{11}} \]

Is there something like \hfill that would work inside display math?  No

Try this

\def\mymacro#1\par{blah blah #1 blah blah}

But a newline isn't a par; it's much closer to
a space than anything else.  If Carlos is really
going to succeed in taking #1 to be everything
up to (but not including) end of line, he'll
need some catcode trickery along the lines of :

	\def \activeeol {\catcode `\^^M = \active}
	\def \passiveeol {\catcode `\^^M = 5 }

	\def \mymacro
		{\activeeol
		 \Mymacro
		}

	\begingroup
	\activeeol %
	\gdef \Mymacro #1
		{\passiveeol %
		 <do something with #1>%
		}%
	\endgroup

Sorry, I interpreted "newline" as "empty line" (that is how the example
appeared).  If the poster really wants the end of line character to be the
delimiter, then Philip's trickery is required.

On the other hand, if \par is a useful delimiter and if the additional space
at the end of the line is the problem, then this is enough:

\def\mymacro#1 \par{blah blah #1 blah blah}

The space before \par will caise the implicit trailing space to be eaten.

I agree.  I've used a simple construction of this type routinely in
countless macros in many contexts, including fairly complex book packages.
There's very little that can go wrong with it, except of course if
you forget the empty line, in which case the macro swallows rather
more text than planned! :-)

Mostly because of typos... ;-)

When wanting something done to a package, the best way is usually to write  
the author. I see now that the author's email isn't printed in the manual,  
but it is listed at the very top of the dtx file. Anyway, that doesn't  
matter much, 'cause I'm the author and we have had email exchanges within  
the last month or so - I was hoping I had left some kind of (non-bad)  
impression...

You might also want to look closer at the bm manual, because it states  
that it actually overwrites \boldsymbol. Using the \boldsymbol command  
 from amsbsy alone works.

You are right however that there is a problem with using a bold face /  
with mathpazo. The reason is that there is no bold face / in the pazo  
fonts! It comes from the standard Palatino/Palladio text font, so... Using  
the commercial PAmath fonts solves the problem.

That was \boldsymbol, what about \bm? Well, in the bm manual, the section  
"Strange failures" mentions that sometimes you may get weird error  
messages if the contents contains something that isn't regular math  
commands. In those cases simply add an extra level of braces.

However I see that I have not provided any kind of detection af math  
version. That is something that could be considered for a future release.  
Please experiment with the package (that's what the x is for :-) and let  
me know if you get something useful out of it.

This might not be the correct way to do it, and there might be other

\include is there for selective compilation; with \includeonly, you
can run your job that has several chapters, focusing only on the
chapter you're interested in.

doing the same in a nested fashion would require more mechanism than
the original designer of latex thought worth doing.  (note: the
original design blithely did nested \include commands, but downgraded
the nested commands to \input commands, with no diagnostic.)

you probably meant to use \input, on the nested instances, at least.

Subject: [texhax] makeindex
Message-ID: <6EC2C743-28E2-11D9-B903-000A957AC34A@tufts.edu>

I am having trouble understanding the behavior of the index-writing 
program.

In a book i am writing, I have a command which I use when printing 
definitions in the text:
	\newcommand{\deffont}[1]{\textbf{#1}\index{#1}}
so that every time I define a term it gets written to the index.   This 
appears to work fine, except that if the term involves mathematical 
text as well as text, I need to boldface the math text by means of 
\boldsymbol in the entry.  Since I don't want to have index entries in 
boldface, I devised a variant of the above
	\newcomman{\deffontcustom}[2]{\textbf{#1}\index{#2}}
where I try to use the key@visual format in the second version:  for 
example, to index the
term $\mathbb{R}$ (which I actually generate via my macro \Reals{}) I 
write (in the text)
	\deffontcustom{$\boldsymbol{\Reals}$}{R@$\mathbb{R}$}
My problem is this:  when I do this, the entry seems to disappear.

What am I doing wrong?

And an ancillary question: is there a single command which will write 
ALL text to which it is applied in a bold series (ie, a command which 
would take an input like "$x$ is a number"
and print it as $\boldsymbol{x}$\textbf{ is a number}?

Finally another question regarding makeindex's behavior.  I am using 
TeXShop (and perhaps should address this to Richard Koch);  naturally 
different sections of the book are different files, all with a common 
project root book.tex.  When I latex a given section, as it should, the 
program latex's the file book.tex (first saving the current file).  
When I then go to the "Typeset" menu and hit "Makeindex", I get the 
console telling me that the .id file has been written.  But then, when 
I hit the "Typeset" button on the pdf window, I don't get the latex, 
but I get the makeindex again.   Huh?

Hello all!

In order to write a two-column report, I'd like to switch to a one-column section (eg for a page-wide table), and then back to a two-column text *in the same page*.

I saw already several options :
(1) multicol package , but this is not elegant, since I need to put all my
report into the multicol environment with two columns.
(2) \one-column or \two-column commands, but this starts a new page
(3) then I could use a documentclass, like the APS Revtex in two columns and
use the \textwide environnment for my figure, but I'd prefer using the
standard Latex documentclasses (report, article) which appear on any
distribution.

Any more suggestion that would fit my need are very much welcome !

thanks for your help...

Stephane.

What's wrong with:

\begin{table*}
Two column table goes here.
\end{table*}

?

It'll float to the top or bottom of a page.... but otherwise quite 
controllable.

It's not much less elegant than using macros like \onecolumn and
\twocolumn.  Maybe it's even more elegant because the multicols
environment provides a very clean LaTeX syntax.  It seems that
multicol is what you need.  There might be some restrictions
concerning floating objects, so I recommend to read the documentation
first.  But it's always a good idea to do this.

Thomas Feuerstack has made a TeX distribution for Windows (only) called
ProTeXt, based on Christian Schenk's MiKTeX (*not* Web2C).  It has a
top-level PDF document which guides you through the installation, with
clickable links.

We plan to include this as one of the software distributions on CD this
year sent to user group members, etc.  It is all free (libre) software.

If any Windows users would like to test this, you can get the current
test image from http://tug.org/ftp/texlive/protext.  Any bug reports or
suggestions are welcome, please email to protext@tug.org.

Thanks,
karl

Hi Philip,

    Since you say it's based on MiKTeX, could you please briefly explain why a
    present (happy) MiKTeX user should consider spending time examining this
    package?  Thanks.

Well, I was just asking for testers, not announcing a release.  Kind of
a different audience.

But anyway, the answer is, if you have current miktex installed and are
happy with your setup, there is no particular reason to look at this.
The main focus is for people who are looking to upgrade, or for a TeX to
install the first time.  Of which there is a constant stream (happily).

Thanks,
karl

Yes, granted, but it would be nice to know something about it.

Maybe I'm naive, but do there really exist test junkies?

Now I'm confused!

So, let's put it this way: I don't mind doing a bit of testing, if there's
some reason, even vague - in other words is there a chance that at some
point, or for some user type, or in some other way protext might be somehow
preferable to MiKTeX?

If you include "new users" as a "user type", then, yes.

It bundles MiKTeX + other tools (texniccenter, gsview) + an installation
document.
It does not change or enhance miktex itself, afaik.

I took a first look at it and can agree to your assessment of the
package. IMHO it is a very good entrance to LaTeX under Windows for
those people who want to switch from WORD and Co. and who have start-up
difficulties to understand the combination of MiKTeX/editor/Ghostscript
etc. (I often observed that behaviour in my LaTeX courses at a German
high school). This combination is very well explained in Thomas'
distribution.

So I can imagine that the distribution may serve as a first step to gain
a LaTeX environment than can be extended individually later on using the
relevant options in the MiKTeX distribution or the other programs.

And I would suggest to include the JabRef bibliography manager in the
distribution.

I think I'll try it out with my next course.

Just my 2 ?.

Message-ID: <1099067824.418271b0ad581@IMP.Lehigh.EDU>

Hello.
I have a big library with almost 300 papers cited. The problem is that the 
format of this library is the following 

\bibitem{walters01}
E.~G. Walters, J.~Schlessman, and M.~J. Schulte, ``Combined Unsigned
and Two's
  Complement Hybrid Squarers,'' in {\em Proceedings of the Thirty Fifth
  Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers}, pp.~861--866,
  November 2001.

Is there a tool I can use to convert these citations to the normal 
bibtex format like.

@ARTICL{walters01,
  AUTHOR =       {},
  TITLE =        {},
  JOURNAL =      {},
  YEAR =         {},
  volume =       {},
  number =       {},
  pages =        {},
  month =        {},
  note =         {},
  abstract =     {},
  keywords =     {},
  source =       {},
}

It will save me a great deal of time.
Thank you.

I need to customize \listoffigures

My thesis advisor demands that the list of figures must show only one sentence/phrase per figure. At the same time he demands long captions that completely describes the figure and sometimes how to derive the figure or replicate the experiment.

How do I tell LaTex to take only the first sentence of each figure caption for the list of figures?

right now I'm doing this manually. I use Word to create the list of figures. Print it out and attach to the thesis. The LaTex document holds a blank page or two for the list of tables and figures. This makes the page numbers match.

If you ask for tools it is quite helpful to tell us which operating
system you use.

It's nearly impossible to write a program which can understand the
\bibitems.  It is possible if all the \bibitems use ***exactly*** the
same format.  I doubt that this is the case.

But you can save a lot of time if you use a fully programmable editor
like emacs under UNIX or Linux.

Emacs allows you to write a function which inserts someting to the
buffer, for instance

((end-of-buffer) (insert ")@ARTICL{,\n
  AUTHOR =       {},\n
  TITLE =        {},\n
  JOURNAL =      {},\n
 .....
))

and you can assign this function to a key.

The graphical user interface of UNIX is much more convenient than
anything else.  You can "copy&paste" just using the mouse and there is
no need to press any key on your keyboard.

Regards,
  Reinhard

No idea how \caption is defined, but if it really
/is/ \def \caption #1#2{...}, then some typing could
be saved, and consistency guaranteed, by the following :

	\def \Caption #1#2{\caption {#1}{#1 #2}}

and thereafter

	\Caption {First sentence}{Seconda sentence}

Thank you.  The good news is the list of figures now uses the first sentence of each caption. 

The bad news are several. I used \caption{first}{first second} and the code below. The result includes (1) a centered caption instead of justified format, (2) additional LaTex errors that claimed the figure label used in the code below is undefined, and (3) the error message below.

**
**Exhibit A. The code that LaTex points to for errors:
**
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centerline{

I think one could do it with a perl program of a few dozen lines, even if
the format of the bibitems varies a little, as perl has excellent
functions for matching text with regular expressions.  I recently
converted a list of 600 references from html to bibtex by this method.  
You would probably need to make some individual adjustments afterwards
with an editor, but the perl program would have done the repetitive work
for you.

However this may not be useful advice unless you have some acquaintance
with perl (or its forerunners, sed awk etc).  You may want to give it a
go, though, as perl is very useful to know.

there's a readily available perl script to do the job.  strange as it
may seem, it's described in the faq...

Dear TUG,

In our book using book.cls in MikTex, we are creating
a selected bibliograhy at the end using:

 \bibliographystyle{plain}
 \markboth{Digital Processing of SAR Data}{Selected Bibliography}
 \renewcommand{\bibname}{Selected Bibliography}
 \nocite{*}
 \bibliography{radar}

Can you please help me with 3 questions:
1. How to remove the numerical labels from the list
2. How to make the running headers initial capitals
    rather than all capitals
3. How to elevate the title "Selected Bibliography"
    to Chapter* status

I have tried editing the plain.bst file, but it does not
seem to cover these items.  I can do item manually by editing the
.bbl file, but I would like to do it auttomatically.

Tahnk you for your help.

Sincerely, Ian

That should presumably read

\newcommand\Caption[2]{\caption[#1]{#1 #2}}

N.B. It's not so much the use of \newcommand, as the square brackets INside
the definition of \Caption (because that's what \caption looks for.

1. This IS a BibTeX question and use of the natbib package is probably the
best advice

2. This NOT a BibTeX question; it is to do with book.cls and you may find
the fancyhdr package the best way to deal with this.

3. This is again to do with book.cls; however, a quick look inside shows
that it is already defined as \chapter*, although you will need to deal with
its defining the head in capitals---see 2. above.
