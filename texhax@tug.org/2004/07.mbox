I also suggest using packages for what they were created and looking
into listings (which can give you a higher typographic quality than a
tabbing evrionment).  For the `<' and `>' there are a number of symbols
you may want to consider (look at math less-than and greater-than, the
French gullimet [quote marks] --- hope that is spellt correctly --- and
possibly others).

I'd try the verbatim environment if you don't need to use (La)TeX 
commands inside the code snippet.

(Please quote correctly next time.) Another option is the `alltt' package
which allows you to use LaTeX commands in the fixed-width environment.

If you really mean a circle, what about this?

\def\notzero{{{-}\mkern-11.5mu\circ}}

or a little bigger

\def\notZero{{\mathchar'174\mkern-15mu{\bigcirc}\mkern-15mu\mathchar'174}}

    Is there some way to enjoy
    both the resources of pdflatex *and* pstricks?

Fundamentally, no.  pstricks requires full PostScript, which is
precisely what PDF was designed to avoid.

One workaround is pdftricks (see CTAN), it requires allowing subprocess
execution in the TeX configuration.

See also the purifyeps package.  I haven't looked at that.

You may find these to be interesting reading:

Two observations:

1.  I believe that the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
for the non-chemist tex-hackers) recommended symbol for standard state is now
just an open circle, which can be produced nicely by \circ
(At any rate, that's what Levine is using in his Physical Chemistry, 5th ed.
and he tries pretty hard to keep up with the IUPAC recommended notation.)

2.  If you really want a circle with a horizontal line through it as a 
superscript, try just using \Theta.  I found it better than any of the
hacks thus far.  (I'm using the package amsmath if that makes any difference)

i guess slitex has only been obsolete for 10 years...

slides class is merely a re-encapsulation of the mid-1980s style of
slitex, in the context of 1994 latex; so if you know slitex you know
slides.cls.

i'm currently drafting a faq answer about slides.  the most nearly
solid text i have in it says: "when current latex came along, the
reason slitex had to be a separate program went away, and its
functionality was supplied by the slides class.  while this makes life
a little easier for system administrators, it does nothing for the
inferior functionality of the class: no-one ``who knows'' uses
slides.cls nowadays."

look at seminar or foils (aka foiltex, a "nosell" licence object, so
on the nonfree tree on ctan and not in distributions).  both are
somewhat younger than slides class, and do well if you're still in the
world that produces slides on foils.

if you give your presentations using a computer together with a
projector of some sort, look at texpower, prosper (or ha-prosper) or
beamer.

all of these packages come with documentation.  most recently i've
used beamer, which i learned (well enough) from scratch in under a
day (which day included writing my presentation).

  class) in order to prevent the page number overtyping a largish
  table on that page.

  Unfortunately, it has not worked. Is this because I am using a table
  environment (with tabularx inside)? Are there other ways to suppress
  page numbering just for a particular page?

  Any advice would be most appreciated.

Kind regards,

I imagine you placed \thispagestyle{empty} OUTside the table environment,
right?

If not, you'll have to send a minimal file with the problem.

Table and figure environments are floats, that is, they do not necessarily
appear on the page where they are place in the LaTeX file.  On the other
hand, \thispagestyle, not surpisingly, acts on the page being output when it
is read by LaTeX.  So, if you place it INsice the floating environment, it
should work (it does for me).

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

The fancyhdr package provides tools for solving this problem and the  
documentation comes with many examples. Below is a short demonstration:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\renewcommand\headrulewidth{0pt}
\cfoot{\iffloatpage{}{\thepage}}
\begin{document}
Here's a little text before we get to the table. The table is
forced on a page of its own with the \texttt{p} specifier.

\begin{table}[p]
   \centering
   \rule{5cm}{10cm}
   \caption{Rules rule!}
\end{table}
\end{document}

I'd like to see how you do that ;-)

\thispagestyle is activated when LaTeX cuts the scroll, so if the float  
object is moved to the next page, the pagestyle there is unaffected (but  
the original page is). In other words this problem in the same category as  
trying to get the current page number in running text by using \thepage  
(which doesn't work) instead of using a label and reference.

Hello

I am not sure if this is the correct place to make my inquiry - please direct me.

I have recently started using TexShop 1.34 on my MAC X 10.2.8. 

I would like to use the Chicago bibliography style in my documents and have downloaded chicago.bst chicago.sty and chicagoa.bst from the CTAN site. However, I cannot get it to work. I have been able to get the plain and unsrt bibliograph styles to work so I assume my source list is okay. 

Would you be able to tell me where I should store the chicago files for LaTex and BibTex to find them? 

Am I using the correct command? This what I have typed in

\begin{document}
\bibliographystyle{chicago}

\bibliography{yetanotherbibl}
\end{document}

and this is the error message I get after running Latex, I run Bibtex.

This is BibTeX, Version 0.99c (Web2C 7.5.2)
The top-level auxiliary file: 5junethesis2.aux
I couldn't open style file chicago.bst
---line 2 of file 5junethesis2.aux
 : \bibstyle{chicago
 :                  }
I'm skipping whatever remains of this command
I found no style file---while reading file 5junethesis2.aux
(There were 2 error messages)

Find the terminal program and run it.  At the prompt, type 

  kpsepath bst 

and put the BST files in one of those directories.  Since it's a local
addition to your TeX distribution, you should probably put it in
something like ~/Library/texmf/bibtex/bst/ .

You may have to type 'texhash' after.

Arrgh, there goes whatever credibility I might have had.  You're quite
right, of course:  my own experience was limited to rather simple cases
where it worked for the trivial reason that the float appeared on the same
page.

Sorry!

Hello

I have several various files which compile successfully. For example: 
file1.tex, file2.tex, etc. and I would like to generate a special 
contents file at the base of title and authors of each file but in the 
same  output "contents file". I did for that:
-------------------------------------------
\newwrite\@cfile
\newif\if@cfileopen \global\@cfileopenfalse

\def\@opencfile{\immediate\openout\@cfile=contents.f\relax
     \global\@cfileopentrue}
    \long\def\titlecontents#1{%
    \if@cfileopen \else \@opencfile \fi
    \begingroup
       \let\protect\string
       \immediate\write\@cfile{Title: #1 \thepage}%
    \endgroup}
%       \long\def\authorcontents#1{%
    \if@cfileopen \else \@opencfile \fi      
      \begingroup
       \let\protect\string
       \immediate\write\@cfile{Authors: #1}%
    \endgroup}
--------------------------------------------------------
But when I compiled the first file "file1.tex" I successed to have in my 
contents file "contents.f" the two entries title and authors of file1.tex.
And when I compiled the second file, the two first entries of file1.tex 
have been erased and replaced by those of file2.tex.
My hope is how to add the other entries in the same contents file when I 
compile the differents file one by one.

Maybe somebody can help me!

Thank you

I can view the document through gv without any problem (with correct

To whom it may concern,

I need help typing my thesis in LaTeX.  I need some things included on my
title page that does not seem possible using the "article" documentclass
that I'm using.  I need to include things like my degree, my committee
members, etc. on the title page and I also need to include in the paper a
table of figures, an acknowledgement page, a dedication, etc.  Is there a
way to create such commands or environments within the "article"
documentclass that will allow me to include such things?  I've searched a
couple of books and the internet and found nothing helpful.  Please give me
any help that you can...my thesis is due in about a week and a half and my
committee members do not know.

Just to establish a baseline, I posted the following in response to a  
similar personal e-mail last night:


You've two choices:

  - reprogram the relevant commands, e.g.,  
\renewcommand{\maketitle}{...} where the ellipsis contains the desired  
new commands

or

  - switch to a more flexible documentclass --- I'd suggest Peter  
Wilson's Memoir. The documentation for this is extensive, and it was  
designed very much with the sort of tweaking you wish to do in mind,  
_and_ it has an option to mimic the article class (but if you want a  
titlepage, you probably shouldn't use that option).

You can find Memoir on CTAN at:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/

and I've a direct link to the manual and some other texts which may  
help:

http://members.aol.com/willadams/books-e-tex.html

I believe that if you spend an evening reading the manual and process  
the LaTeX source for reference you should be able to work out 95% of  
your difficulties. The balance can probably be addressed by the FAQ  
available at:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?introduction=yes

and judicious searching of the newsgroup comp.text.tex using

http://groups.google.com

http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF- 
8&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=%22your+query+here%22&btnG=Search&meta=group%3Dcom 
p.text.tex

where you replace ``your+query+here'' with a descriptive text of what  
you need to learn about.

Probably the best thing is to use

\begin{titlepage}
  text ...
\end{titlepage}

and set the whole thing up yourself the way you want it.

I know this is slightly off topic for this group, so forgive me
if I am offensive. Nonetheless, since most readers of texhax
are so nice ...

I was in the US last week and received one of the new 20 dollar bills.
It has one of the common anticounterfeiting measures: include some
teeny type that will not scan/photocopy well. Just to the right of
Andrew Jackson's face under the first part of the work TWENTY is a
string 20 USA 20 USA ... The size is about 2/3pt. The newest series
of Canadian dollar bills has perspective type descending to about 2pt.

So my question is: does the US now hold the record for teeny type on
paper currency? What about the new Euros or others?

Cheers,
Michael

To answer my own question:

You need to update chapterbib.  After you do this, things will work
fine.

I tried to search the web on how to make the background transparent for a figure drawn by xfig --- this is what I want. I got the following message: When a figure is exported in .fig format, I could have the choice to make the background transparent. Does anybody have any ideas on:
1. How to choose the background and transparent colors?
2. How to paste a .fig by latex? I need this graph for my conference paper.
 
Thanks in advance.

Vertical skips are, by default, ignored at the top and bottom of pages as
are horizontal skips at the beginning and end of lines (for obvious
reasons - think about it).

To force their observance use the \vspace* and \hspace* commands in
combination, in this case, with the \stretch command (see below).

Yes, try this (I've also done a little tidying):

Some introductory remarks ...

\newpage
\setcounter{page}{1}
\renewcommand\thepage{\arabic{page}}

The body of the text ...

HOWEVER, as William suggested a different class (such as "memoir" or simply
"book") would have helped immensely.

Indeed, since "article" class does NOT support chapters, I'm wondering just
how you managed with a thesis.

P.S.  Most of this is all really rather basic stuff and a decent read of any
of the simple manuals available free on-line would have helped.

It's not obvious.  It's annoying since LaTeX refuses to do what I
explicitly ask it to do.  To get around it I've had to resort to this
stupid trick:

Subject: [texhax] Trying to find the /right/ piece of LaTeX documentation.
Message-ID: <40ED97CB.6010006@hutnick.com>

Hello,

I am writing a book with LaTeX, using the book class.  I have a few 
interrelated questions.

Is there a document that discusses how do modify the layout safely and 
correctly?  I have read the many warnings and I still want to proceeded. 
  The FAQ indicates that this info can be found in "The LaTeX Manual," 
which brings me to the next question.

I have found a dozen or more references to "The LaTeX Manual."  I have 
yet to find one that provides any hint as to what this is.  Is it a 
dead-tree book?  I can't find it on Amazon.com.  Is it available on the 
Internet?  I can't find it with Google or in CTAN.  Is it "man latex?" 
On my system that is less than a page.  I'm really puzzled about this.

This (http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=changemargin) FAQ 
entry references the manual, but this 
(http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=books) doesn't list it. 
  Neither does this 
(http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=tutorials).

Finally, I'd like to set my book so that there is a very wide "Margin 
Notes" (\marginparwidth) area.  I'd like to place most of my figures in 
that area.  I can't seem to find a way to make that happen.  Am I on the 
wrong track?

Thanks in advance for any and all help!

The LaTeX manual (dead-tree book by Leslie Lamport) is good for
telling you how to use LaTeX and what all the pieces do, but isn't so
great for helping you figure out how to do new things.  But it's good
to have around for hacking.  You can use it to make sure that new
classes do more or less what they're supposed to do.

To learn how to hack code to do new things, the TeXbook (by Knuth)
helps a lot, and so do all the laTeX packages that come with enough
documentation that you can figure out how they do what they do.
That's where I've learned what little I know.  

About your figures, people here have written about the memoir class,
which I keep meaning to look into, but haven't.  Anyway, my cursory
look makes me think it might be better at what you're after with the
figures.

You snipped the two lines where Philip explained how to get a space  
that'll never disappear: \vspace*{<dimen>} and \hspace*{<dimen>} and also  
the example where he showed how to use it. It's not that LaTeX refuses to  
do what you want, it merely tries to get the best result most of the time.

Normally when you want to insert a vertical space is is not desirable to  
let it have any effect directly after a page break, else you'd just be  
getting a new page with the first 2cm blank. This may be what you want for  
a titlepage, but that is certainly not the most common behavior sought.

I had more or less the same problem with HP DeskJet 640C.  I used
`mpage` to setup custom margins.  I also remember having trouble telling
`mpage` that the output should have A4 pagesize.  What I used for
printing zia.ps (A5) two pages per sheet was:

	psbook zia.ps tmp.ps
	mpage -m0 -2 tmp.ps > tmp_a5.ps
	psresize -Pa5 -pa4 -q tmp_a5.ps outp.ps

I haven't looked into the problem, though.  So there may be a proper
solution.

Thanks for your logical explanation!  Please make sure that this

Although, I don't see any sane reason for that.  You can try redefining
`\usepackage', the `document' environment and everything else that
appears in your preambles and try something like

	\phantom{\input{file1}\input{file2}\input{file3}}

(If you are more elaborate, you may construct a macro that eats up
tokens until it finds `\begin{document}' and redefines `\enddocument' to
stop the output of tokens by the macro.)

How does concatenating the ``contents'' files work, and do you not
prefer to work with them, rather than the `.tex's?

Does anybody know how to make these two figures transparent to each other so that these two patterns can be seen in the intersected area at the same time?

I don't think the idiology of xfig or PostScrip fits what you are trying
to do.  (Non-transparent ink is layered on top of a page.)  You may want
to convert your diagrams into a raster format, open them with GIMP (or a
similar) editor and then overlay them (look at the opacity factor).

i don't actually rate lamport much, any more.  latex out-of-the-box is
so rigid and so difficult to customise that lamport really doesn't
help.

if you've enough money (and don't care too much about trees) the latex
companion is a splendid buy.

well, yes.  but i don't reckon it for beginners.  (it's what i started
with, but i'm convinced of the worth of higher-level things now.)

memoir is _designed_ for flexibility.  it comes with a good manual,
and everyone i know who's tried it, now swears by it.  (except me, but
i don't write serious documents any more...)

the one big problem seems to me to be the simple size of the manual.
it's all jolly good stuff, but i find it daunting.  all my faq stuff
about it is either direct from the author, or from occasional dabbling
in the manual.

i write odd bits of documentation, and i use the koma-script classes.
they two are far more customisable than the latex originals, but my
feeling is that they're not quite as flexible as memoir (and the
english translation of the manual is not as good as the german
original; whatever, not in the memoir league).  lovely design, though.

Message-ID: <000501c46537$2b5f77a0$bbc10b44@ludu>

Good evening,

I have purchased from TUG the last version available of LaTex.

I am using a Xemacs editor, and it works terrific, in Tex and LaTex. Alos it
converts "tex files into *.pdf fast and great.

The problem is how to generate a *ps file.

Many journals also request the *.ps file of the submission.

The only command I can use is to select from the upper command line in
XEmacs: "Comands", and then: "Print" and then: "ps"

IN the bottom command line I have now: "dvips fielname.tex -Pps"
I hit enter, it says the ps file was printed okay...and there is no ps file.

Please, could you help me?

Thanks,

A VFAQ (see, e.q., Q.100 in Robin's TeX FAQ): save it as a jpg (even
M$paint will do that) and then use jpeg2ps.

 ====================================================================== 

EuroTeX 2005 will be a special one: we celebrate the
2^{2^{2^{2^{2^{-\infty}}}}} = 16th anniversary of both Dante and
GUTenberg.  EuroTeX 2005 will take place Between Metz and Nancy in the
Premonstratension Abbey of Pont-à-Mousson, in a facility where we can
all be in one place.  There will be talks and free workshops and more
than enough opportunities to discuss and share experiences. The
conference is also a great opportunity to meet the people who make it
happen.

The site of the conference is under construction at:
    http://www.gutenberg.eu.org/EuroTeX2005/

The theme of the conference will be:

    _Let's TeX Together!_

Possible topics include:
    * TeX, TeX extensions, tools
    * Macros and formats
    * Fonts: math fonts, OpenType, etc.
    * Metapost, Metafont, Metafun, etc.
    * Typography and digital documents
    * Professional experiences with TeX

Tutorials will be offered during the first part of the conference, from
March 7th at noon to Tuesday 8th evening.  Invited speakers and regular
speakers will give talks during the second part from Wednesday 9th to
Friday 11th. People are invited to submit original papers on any of the
topics listed above or any other topic related to the main theme of the
conference. The topics list above is by no way exhaustive.

Paper submissions, proposals for tutorials and remarks relating to the
program of the meeting should be sent to the Program Committee mailing
list (mailto:eurotex2005-program@gutenberg.eu.org) by September 1st,
2004. Important: because of the international audience, we expect
submissions in English.

And last but not least ...  because 16 is a special number for computer
scientists, we have good hope that the well known author of TeX, Donald
E.  Knuth be our special guest. We also hope to have Hermann Zapf, who
has a special place in the TeX community as special guest.

We expect users and contributors from all over the world to attend the
conference.  We are currently working on the program, so feel free to
submit topics, suggestions.

The organization committee hope that you will join us in Pont-à-Mousson.

			Prices
 ====================================================================== 

We do not have yet all the information regarding pricing, only an upper
limit of what we will get. We are doing our possible to keep the price
as low as possible while providing the best accommodation and food.

Currently, in order to simplify registration handling, we plan to offer
only 2 options which will include accommodation, meals, coffee breaks,
gala diner, conference fee and materials.  There will be an early-bird
discount offer according to the calendar, so stay tuned.  Full
registration information will be published on the conference web site
soon.

Tutorials by themselves will be offered for free. The higher price will
cover accommodation, meals and facility rental.

There will be a supplementary tour organized on Saturday 12th. We are still
discussing different options about it.

 ====================================================================== 
		Coming to the Conference
 ====================================================================== 

The closest international airport is Luxembourg.  Usually, it costs
about the same to come to either Frankfurt, London or Paris than to come
to Luxembourg for international flights.

By train, you can come to either Nancy or Metz and then take a shuttle
to go to Pont-à-Mousson.

By car, Pont-à-Mousson is located on E23/A31, half-way between Metz and
Nancy.

Detailed information will be published on the conference web site.

The command dvips filename -Pps prints the device independent file (.dvi)
to a postscript printer. You cannot give .tex file as an input to the
dvips command.

First, run LaTeX from the Command menu, if there are no errors .dvi file
will be generated with the same filename as your .tex file. If you want
the output to be saved in a postscript file, type:

dvips filename.dvi -o

You can view the .ps file using ghostview (gv). For some reasons, if you
cannot run LaTeX inside XEmacs, then type `latex filename.tex' from the
command line for getting the .dvi file.

The "The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e" explains this and many other

Hi, everybody.

I'm a plain TeX user, and the file hyperbasics.tex works perfectly to create
hyperlinks in the .dvi file: first of all I input the file hyperbasics.tex
into the .tex file, and then at a certain place of the .tex file I write
						\hyperdef\mysymbol{label}{}{}
and then I say
						\hyperref{}{label}{}{Voila!}
so obtaining a beautiful hyperlink.
Now I would like the same between two different files, let's call them
file1.tex and file2.tex.
In file1.tex I write
                \hyperdef\mysymbol{label}{}{}
and in file2.tex I say
                \hyperref{file1.dvi}{label}{}{Voila!}.
Then I open the two dvi files using the program xdvi, but when I click on
the word 'Voila' in file2.dvi
I get the message
                Error: reference "file1.dvi#label." not found
What's wrong? How can I recover?
Can anybody help?
Maybe this subject is not proper for this mailing list.
In this case, please could anyone suggest a proper one? I couldn't find it
so far.
Any hint will be highly appreciated.

When you say "2/3pt" do you mean "2pt or 3pt", or do you mean

Dear TUG Support,

I recently joint TUG and received the TeXLive CD.
This has been downloaded into my PC as the directory
             C:\Program Files\TexLive

But the programs I've downloaded which need to use this
can't seem to find what they need.

  For example:  WINEdt is  not able to find YAP or to
                make the dvi previewing button on its toolbar

                When I try to LaTeX a file I get the message
                "cannot find  overwrite.."

  So I tried to download WinTeX2000 which I've used before.
  when I try to install it I get the message

                "The MikTeX Installroot could not be found."

Questions:

Should I place TeXLive in a different directory?

Should I place these wordprocessing programs in a particular
 place so that they can use TeXLive?

Does TeXLive contain YAP? (A search does not come up with it.)
  If not what dvi previewer is supplied.

In the \TexLive\bin\win32 directory I find many files whose names
 start with mktex, but none of them seems large enough to be a
working TeX system. (Maybe all of them together?)

Please help!  I can be reached agt 301 219-0637 or at the email
address above.

Subject: [texhax] detailed documentation and examples of bib styles?
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10407081818130.6084-100000@castle.isye.gatech.edu>

folks, 

I'm asking this only because I've spent several hours reading manuals
and experimenting with downloaded files and maybe one of you has some
experience in this area.

For two publications I'm working on with my advisor, there are
bibliographic styles required other than the Chicago style required in the
GT theses.

I see in "The Latex Companion" several other styles, such as "acm"
that
come close to what I need. But when I download the style and package files
and use them when compiling, I find that acm automatically causes double
columns which mess up my presentation. 

Two questions:

1. Any detailed documentation on all the options within the Chicago style?
2. Any detailed documentation on how to successfully
compile with the many other styles referenced in The Latex Companion?
3. Any detailed documentation on tailoring an existing bib style to create
a custom version?

wrt to the latter question I need a detailed example to follow since I am
a Latex novice and the cryptic instruction in Latex Companion doesn't get
me there. 

thanks,

Subject: [texhax] Using a variable to scale psfrags
Message-ID: <20040709032008.57079.qmail@web41902.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I am using the psfrag package to replace dummy text
labels in some EPS figures. Getting all the labels to
scale proportionally with the figure itself works fine
with the \resizebox command, but I'm having trouble
using a variable to scale the individual text labels
with respect to the boxes in the figure. Here's what I
have:

\begin{figure}
 \begin{psfrags}
   \def\myscale{1.5}
   \psfragscanon
   \psfrag{tag1}[][][\myscale]{Label 1}
   \psfrag{tag2}[][][1.75\myscale]{Label 2}
   ...
  
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{foo.eps}}
 \end{psfrags}
\end{figure}

The first two (optional) arguments to psfrag (empty in
the example above) have to do with alignment; those
work fine. The problem is with the third optional
argument. TeX handles both psfrag lines above OK, but
the presence of the second line results in a
postscript file that crashes the ghostscript
interpreter.

I've tried \newcommand, \newlength, \newcounter, and
\def -- but for various reasons, none of those work.
I'd like to be able to only adjust the value of
\myscale once at the top of each figure environment,
instead of having to manually tweak all the \psfrag
calls (some of my figures have ten or more).

Does anyone know of a way to do this?

Thanks very much in advance,

HJ

I have been using Latex, through MikteX, since some years ago. It works great.
 
However, reacently, I updated to the new version of MikteX (ver. 2.4), and I am getting problems when using the option Spanish with the Babel package. One of the problems is that when I put any decimal number, let's say 3.14159, I get in the final document 3,14159 (instead a decimal point, I get a comma).
 
Can somebody tell me what can I do to solve this problem?  Am I doing something wrong?

not surprising; you're giving it a scaling factor of 1.751.5, which is
at the very least confusing.

the false assumption is that tex (or something) is going to multiply
the two numbers together.  while there are packages that can do "real"
calculation, i would suggest they're more trouble than they would
save -- i think you have to bite the bullet and write separate macros
for different scale factors (or just do the whole lot by hand).

Hi, Manuel

In the preamble of your document write:  \spanishdecimal{.}

By mutual agreement  almost all the countries where the spanish language 
is official, have adopted the use of the comma as the decimal separator. 
All countries except Mexico, where a dot is the decimal separator.  I 
really do not understand this fact :-(  ...

Best regards...

Thank you to everyone for your replies.

The short answer to the question of putting material in the margin notes 
area would seem to be "\marginpar."  Which seems obvious to me, now :-)

But that doesn't work for floats.  (LaTeX Error: Not in outer par mode.) 
  I'm currently printing the memoir manual . . .

I suspect this is exactly what Babel is supposed to
do in these circumstances!  Doesn't Spain use the
decimal comma (like France, Germany, ...) rather than
the decimal point ?

Cf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_point

Sorry -- for this group I should have said $\frac{2}{3}$ or ${2 \over 3}$.
What does it say on English currency? In Canada we seem to love our
buidings since we have the repeated expressions:
"THE WEST BLOCK OF PARLIAMENT  L'EDIFICE DE L'OUEST DU PARLEMENT" and
"LA BIBLIOTHEQUE DU PARLEMENT  THE LIBRARY OF PARLIAMENT". None too
inspiring, I'm afraid. I guess we have an ediface complex. At least the 
pictures are pretty.

Cheers,
Michael

Both of the chunks of code are in my preamble.  When I do:

\placefig{
\captionof{figure}{\caption{\label{1}The Plane.}}}
\begin{figure}[htp]
         \pspicture(-4,-4)(4,4)

\rput(-2,-2){Quadrant III}
\rput(2,-2){Quadrant IV}
         \endpspicture
%\caption{The Plane.}
\end{figure}
}

LaTeX complains:

    ! Undefined control sequence.
    <argument> ... ][s]{\marginparwidth }  \captionof

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Dear TUG Support,

I recently joint TUG and received the TeXLive CD.
This has been downloaded into my PC as the directory
             C:\Program Files\TexLive

But the programs I've downloaded which need to use this
can't seem to find what they need.

  For example:  WINEdt is  not able to find YAP or to
                make the dvi previewing button on its toolbar

                When I try to LaTeX a file I get the message
                "cannot find  overwrite.."

  So I tried to download WinTeX2000 which I've used before.
  when I try to install it I get the message

                "The MikTeX Installroot could not be found."

Questions:

Should I place TeXLive in a different directory?

Should I place these wordprocessing programs in a particular
 place so that they can use TeXLive?

Does TeXLive contain YAP? (A search does not come up with it.)
  If not what dvi previewer is supplied.

In the \TexLive\bin\win32 directory I find many files whose names
 start with mktex, but none of them seems large enough to be a
working TeX system. (Maybe all of them together?)

Please help!  I can be reached agt 301 219-0637 or at the email
address above.

I think it is quite obvious that you defined ``\@captionof'', but never
``\captionof''.

Yes of course I made an  error
it's:  \def\captionof#1#2{{\def\@captype{#1}#2}}

Hi Marshall,

    I received a note back that the receiving mailbox
    was full the first time.

FYI, that was presumably simply one of the subscribers who has a
misconfigured mail program.  Your mail did go through to the list.

    Should I place TeXLive in a different directory?

Any directory should do, although of course it would not be good to try
to install TL and anything else in the same directory.
C:\Program Files\TexLive sounds fine.

    Does TeXLive contain YAP? (A search does not come up with it.)

No.
      
      If not what dvi previewer is supplied.

For Windows, at least windvi, not sure if there are others.

  For example:  WINEdt is  not able to find YAP or to
                make the dvi previewing button on its toolbar

Sorry, I don't know how to configure winedt.  Maybe someone else can
help.

                When I try to LaTeX a file I get the message
                "cannot find  overwrite.."

"Cannot find overwrite"?  This message does not make any sense.
Is that the exact wording?  Is there a filename or any other information?

    In the \TexLive\bin\win32 directory I find many files whose names
     start with mktex, but none of them seems large enough to be a
    working TeX system. (Maybe all of them together?)

The mktex... programs are auxiliary.  The main TeX binary is named "tex",
also "latex", etc.

      So I tried to download WinTeX2000 which I've used before.
      when I try to install it I get the message
                    "The MikTeX Installroot could not be found."

I haven't heard of wintex2000, but in any case, miktex is a completely
different distribution from TeX Live.  Trying to run both at the same
time would require very clear separation, and would probably cause
confusion in any case.  Miktex has its own mailing lists for support,
where there would be more miktex experts to help, if you go that route.

Best,
karl

One other possibility I thought I would mention, though not exactly what
you asked for (as Herbert replied, you want the btxhak documentation for

TeX does not do maths automatically!  It's not even automatic that \myscale
should get expanded as it does in the first case (in other words, not all
commands expand their arguments as here).  In the second case I imagine that
\psfrag passes something like 1.751.5 on to postscript!  You'll have to use
something like \myscaleone and \myscaletwo and define their values before
calling \psfrag.

There is indeed a package for doing floating arithmetic but I can't remember
it's name right now.

There are some classes for doing newsletters on CTAN.

Don Hosek used TeX to lay out the first year or three of his magazine, 
_Serif: The Magazine of Fine Type and Typography_, but switched to 
Adobe InDesign at the end.

Stephan Lehmke had a very interesting presentation at TUG2003 on 
creating a layout for various catalogs --- his abstract is up on the 
TUG2003 pages --- unfortunately, this was contract work, and isn't 
available.

The company I work for has done some Journal layouts using Plain TeX 
--- essentially it's a matter of sticking in the text using various 
techniques, then having a custom output routing examine everything 
which is available, fill a page with it according to user-specified 
rules, delete what has been placed from the list of things waiting to 
be placed, then repeating until all is place, or one arrives at the end 
of one's page count (you need to have a lot of discretionary material 
to place for this to work).

FWIW, my choice for doing magazine layout at this point in time would 
probably be SoftMagic's Project M, www.softmagic.com

You can choose which TeX-system you have installed if MiKTeX doesn't  
figure it out itself: Choose "Options" -> "Configurations" -> "fpTeX

Around 1989 or 90, TUG's annual meeting was held at McGill.  A woman who 
was involved with the publication of TV-Guide (the material that 
surrounded the listings, not the listings themselves) gave a talk on the 
use of TeX (probably not LaTeX, but I don't recall) for that publication.  
I don't remember if it was published, but if it was, that could be a place 
to start.  As she pointed out, TeX is not format driven and there were 
many problems.  I think they basically used a preprocessor to generate 
\parshape specifications that were then used to lay out the material.  One 
of the problems was that sometimes text had to flow around a photo.  I 
came away with the impression that TeX was not a good tool for this sort 
of publication.  Although I would not hesitate to use it for a simple 
newsletter that didn't use fancy formatting.

Yes.  Unfortunately, the project apparently never came to fruition.
I seem to recall one or two TUGboat articles, but apparently we haven't

There was also a thread on comp.text.tex about this a little while ago.

Thank you to everyone for your replies.

The short answer to the question of putting material in the margin notes 
area would seem to be "\marginpar."  Which seems obvious to me, now :-)

But that doesn't work for floats.  I'm currently printing the memoir

I think I remember that David Ness was behind the TV Guide project,
and I think I remember also that a good many issues actually
came out from the TeX project.  It did involve a lot of
independent processing to get the parshapes right, and it was
in no sense WYSIWYG.

I also remember that a corporate takeover was one of the chief
reasons that the TeX approach was dropped.

it's been several years since I last used LaTeX and I must admit I've

Attached to this mail is a jpeg that shows the style I'm trying to code.
Most of the stuff (changing fonts, changing the headers) I can do. The

Any ideas on how to do this? Any help will be appreciated.

Insert the following command in the preambule:

\makeatletter
\def\@seccntformat#1{\hskip-15mm\protect\makebox[15mm][l]{\csname 
the#1\endcsname}}
\makeatother

Note that the dimmension 15mm is just set as an example and you can put

it's difficult to guess what you're doing that might have this
effect.  indeed, it's difficult to be entirely sure even what you
really want.  perhaps a minimal document (for example, just your
document, less the packages included and going no further than the
\maketitle) would help us...

when you say "footnote" i presume you're referring to things
introduced with \thanks, as documented for footnotes in \maketitle?

FWIW, I posted a technique I was working on for this sort of thing a 
while back to comp.text.tex.

Essentially one lays the job out in a graphical app (I was using Altsys 
Virtuoso), and the text had to be anchored in a corner, then one flowed 
in an endless series of ``x''s and spaces, made a .pdf which marked 
page breaks with a distinct text tag, then one converted the .pdf into 
a plain text file w/ just the ``x x x ...'', and looked at each page's 
worth of data, noting which corner it was anchored in. One then 
calculated a \parshape for it, and made use of that in tex --- it was 
the automatic calculation of that where I got bogged down, did it by 
hand once or twice, but my programming skills weren't up to it.

You might look at http://bmeps.sourceforge.net/.  I haven't used it, so 
I can't speak to how well it works.  I'd hesitate to use jpeg2ps if you 
are starting with a bitmap, since bitmaps are lossless and jpegs are 
lossy.  You can use the GIMP or whatever to convert your bmp to a png, 
which is also lossless, and then use bmeps to convert the png directly 
to eps.

Good luck!

Tried it and it works like a charm. But I noticed that the \hrule I have in
my headings only covers the length of the text and does not include the
'column' that now holds the section numbers. The same thing goes for the
chapter titles (I have an \hrule in them too). How do I make those \hrules
cover that 'column' too?

Thanks.

I'm inclined to agree (though jpeg2ps takes advantage of the fact that
postscript understands jpeg to just put a ps wrapper around the jpeg
image, resulting in a much smaller eps file).

 You can use the GIMP or whatever to convert your bmp to a png,

GIMP will save directly as a postscript (with an option to make it a
true eps).

Personally, I'd leave it as a bmp (which latex understands) or convert
to a png (which pdflatex understands), but I guess some
people/publishers insist on eps.

In addition to all the other suggestions:

convert (or mogrify for a batch conversion) from the ImageMagick suite
works very well, and will go straight from a bmp to an eps.

imagetops also works, but generates somewhat larger files (I guess
because it converts to pnm first and then uses pnmtops)

Both these are quite standard on most Unix (certainly most Linux)
systems, and freely available.

It is obvious because \hrule follows the dimension of "\textwidth". What 
you have to do for the chapter titles is to use \rule{width}{height} 
instead of \hrule.
Note that: 
                 width = \textwidth + the dimension of the column you 
hve added
and finally you have to use:
                \hskip-15mm\rule{width}{height}

But fot the headings it's much more special and I would like to know 
what did you use for that?

So you can add the following command which the second argument is the 
dimension of the column you have added

\addtolength{\headwidth}{15mm}

Message-ID: <20040713201501.67634.qmail@web41902.mail.yahoo.com>

hi everyone,

thanks for all the suggestions. pav's suggestion is
indeed correct: the "fp" package does the trick
nicely. for example:

\usepackage[fp]
...
\begin{figure}
  \begin{psfrags}
    \def\myscale{1.5}
    \psfragscanon
    \psfrag{tag1}[][][\myscale]{Label 1}
    ..
    \FPmul\myscale2{\myscale{} * 1.5}
    \psfrag{tag2}[][][\myscale2]{Label 2}
    ...
   
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{foo.eps}}
  \end{psfrags}
\end{figure}

and so on. this way, once the desired sizes of the
labels (relative to one another) are determined, it is
only necessary to change the definition of \myscale to
adjust their sizes relative to the boxes in the figure
itself. of course, changing the first argument to
\resizebox scales the entire figure -- boxes, psfrags,
etc. -- gracefully as before.

(sorry if this seems trivial, or is considered bad TeX
form, but i have several hundred figures and many have
a dozen or more lines of psfrags in them.)

anyway, thanks for your help!

that's dangerous: you're redefining \myscale -- the "2" isn't part of

\myscale2 will now work, but \myscale on its own (as here) would blow

Subject: [texhax] Indenting the footnote rule - how to?
Message-ID: <40F5511D.9060502@cc.com.pl>

Hello,

I need to construct a one-page document in LaTeX (using tetex) where the 
lower left corner of the paper must not contain any text (this is due to 
the emblem being printed there on the company paper). I would like to 
indent the footnotes on the page to clear this emblem. The main text 
needs to stay as it is (normal).

I am using letter class. So far I have managed to hack the section of 
the letter.cls file (by trial and error :( ) to indent the text of the 
footnote. I changed the original code of:

\long\def\@makefntext#1{%
     \noindent
     \hangindent 5\p@
     \hb@xt@5\p@{\hss\@makefnmark}#1}

to:

\long\def\@makefntext#1{%
     \noindent
     \hangindent 100\p@
     \hb@xt@100\p@{\hss\@makefnmark}#1}

(changed the 5 to 100).

But I cannot seem to find a way to indent the line above the footnotes 
(\footnoterule) as well.... :(

I would appreciate any advice on how to do this. Also, maybe there is a 
much easier or elegant way to solve the original problem?

Thanks a lot,

Michal Dobaczewski.

\renewcommand\footnoterule{%
\kern-3p@
\hspace*{10mm}\hrule\@width.4\columnwidth
\kern2.6\p@}

Note the dimension 10mm is just an example and you can put what ever you 
want.

Hello,

Thanks for the response. Unfortunately this doesn't work for me - there 
is no visible effect. In fact, I've tried this before. The hspace seems 
to affect the paragraph text only i.e if I put:

\renewcommand\footnoterule{%
   \kern-\p@
   \hspace*{2in} aaa \hrule \@width .1\columnwidth
   \kern .6\p@}

then it indents the "aaa" text, but still doesn't indent the rule.

On the other hand I have already received a working solution (as far as 
I can tell it was sent to the private address only so I cannot forward 
it to the group myself).

Thanks all who took time to try to help.

Michal Dobaczewski.

I beg to disagree: did you actually try this, Mohamed?  Of course, there is
a typo - \kern-3p@ should be \kern-3\p@.  However, when I do this it simply
doesn't work - and if you try something like

\renewcommand\footnoterule{
 \kern-3\p@ X\hspace*{10mm}X\hrule \@width .4\columnwidth \kern2.6\p@}

you will immediately see why.  Hence my (horrible!) construction with \vbox
etc.

If you are refering to the mail in which I said it works then you were 
the only recipient.

But since you say you just forgot, then I'll just go ahead and post your 
solution now to make things simpler. This is the code I got from Philip R.:

and this works ok.

Once again thanks.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.53.0407150942370.15354@sun06.ams.org>

the reason the suggested approaches don't indent the
rule is that \hrule is by definition a vertical mode
command, and will either shift you into vertical mode
or fail with an error.  \vrule is what works in
horizontal mode.  you do, however, have to specify all
three dimensions, and get back into vertical mode:

    \renewcommand\footnoterule{%
       \kern-\p@
%       \hspace*{2in} aaa \hrule \@width .1\columnwidth
       \hspace*{2in} aaa
       \vrule \@width .1\columnwidth \@height.4\p@ \@depth\z@
       \par
       \kern .6\p@}

obviously the magnitude of the dimensions can be
jiggered -- \@height 2.4\p@ \@depth-2\p@  will
raise the rule by 2pt.

Message-ID: <E1Bl6jR-00038x-00@mta1.cl.cam.ac.uk>

i have just released version 3.12 of the faq; this is only a little
more than a month later than i had originally intended.

as usual the (limping) dynamic faq is available from
http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq, while sources, .pdf and other formats, and a
static html version of the faq are available from ctan help/uk-tex-faq

the change file for this version is appended

Robin Fairbairns

For the FAQ and CTAN teams

========================================================================

CHANGES-3.12

Changes in version 3.12

Acquiring the software
  Replace three "finding things" answers with a single "Finding
  (La)TeX files", which covers the ground of the old questions, but
  with a more nearly up-to-date emphasis.  This area needs more
  attention; "hints on regular expressions" from the old set is no
  more -- which probably doesn't matter (much) since almost no-one
  uses "quote site index" any longer.

Systems, etc.
  Expunge mention of the (defunct) 4allTeX CD-ROM under "editors and
  shells" (it had long since gone from CD-ROM answer).
  Mention the MikTeX CD from the CD-ROM answer.
  Tidied the answer about systems for macintoshes

Mathematics:
  Clarification of answer label mathsize (following c.t.t. thread)

Document structure (and similar places):
  Corrected stupid error in the example in Q-alreadydef

Installing (La)TeX files:
  Whole section moved up to before "Fonts" in the FAQ (rationalisation)

Macros:
  further explanation in Q-protect

New or revised packages (or just ones never before mentioned):
  MimeTeX mentioned (along with TechExplorer) in label mathml
  europecv mentioned in label cv
  highlight reference upgraded (because I now understand it better)
  chapterfolder mentioned in label docotherdir

Presentation:
  Web version now copes with tables (in a pretty simplistic way)

New answers:
subsection{Common errors}:
  label zerochap: "Why is my section numbering 0.1...?"
subsection{Common misunderstandings}:
  label tocloftwrong: "Numbers too large in table of contents, etc." (providing
    a link from the problem to the solution in answer label tocloft)
subsection{Creating bibliographies}:
  label buildbib: "Creating a BibTeX bibliography file"
subsection{Creating citations}:
  label usebibtex: "'Normal' use of BibTeX from LaTeX"
  label compactbib: "Reducing spacing in the bibliography"
  label bibtocorder: "Table of contents rearranges 'unsrt' ordering"
subsection{Generic macros and techniques}
  label ifpdf: "Am I using PDFTeX?"
section{The joy of TeX errors}:
  label altabcr: "Alignment tab changed to \cr"
  label manymathalph: "Too many math alphabets"
  label normalszmiss: "\normalsize not defined"
  label missbegdoc: "Missing \begin{document}"
  label divzero: "Graphics division by zero"
section{Current TeX-related projects}:
  label extex: outline description of the ExTeX project
  label xetex: outline description of the XeTeX project
subsection{Hyphenation}:
  label hyphexcept: use of, and pitfalls of, hyphenation exceptions
subsection{Page layout}:
  label outszwrng: the infamous "stupid acrobat reader" answer

Message-ID: <20040719051057.91645.qmail@web52603.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear Sir,

I am a TeX user, I am facing some problem in
hyphenation pattern which comes automatically from
TeX,
I have a word breacking dictionary, some of its words
are given below having hyphen in the place where the
word may break if required. I have tried to change the
hyphenation pattern from default US hyphenation to UK
hyphenation, but it is still not the same which I
need.

Some of the words from Dictionary:

A
aard-vark
aard-wolf
aba-cus
aba-lone
...

B
baba-coote
ba-bassu
bab-bitt
bab-bittry
ba-bi-russa
bab-bler
bab-bling
...
...
...

What penalty should I fix to get proper hyphenation?
Is there any document having detail about complete
hyphenation process of a Dictionary.

Waiting for reply

Thanks for your kind cooperation in advance

Krishan Gopal

You can't do anything by changing penalties as such.

> Is there any document having detail about complete
> hyphenation process of a Dictionary.

If there aren't too may words that come out incorrectly you can try putting
something like the following in your preamble:

\hyphenation{baba-coote ba-bassu bab-bitt bab-bittry ba-bi-russa bab-bler
bab-bling}

One question though: how are you changng the hyphenation pattern from US to
UK?  This should normally be done with

\usepackage[UKenglish]{babel}, or perhaps \usepackage[british]{babel}

However, it needs the hyphenation patterns to be load in your version of
LaTeX - with MiKTeX you need to open the Options Wizard, select the
Languages tab and check ukenglish then got to the General tab and run Update
Now for the Format Files.

You will still need the \hyphenation command to deal with exceptions.

Message-ID: <E5DCE74FB91C8A48BD146961542AFE7334E195@email1.core.dakota.mn.us>

I would like some ideas for how to add text to postscript files that I am including in a LaTeX document.  
I want to use LaTeX to generate the text, so that the fonts and math symbols will match the rest of my document. 
I need to place the text at specific places in the figures, and in some cases I will need to place the text on a white background that covers part of the figure.  

My figures consist of schematic drawings with axes, lines, curves, etc., which need labels.  So far, I have made my own postscript files from my own reseach code (Fortran) which knows the physical problems being worked on.  Some of the figures I could re-build from scratch, and include placeholders in the ps output for text, but some of the figures are pretty old and I doubt that I could find the original code to re-created them - for those I would just like to edit the ps files from scratch.

I would also be interested in learning a drawing environment for relatively simple figures.

I don't know where to begin.
My thanks to anyone who can point me in a fruitful direction.

Subject: [texhax] Typesetting a Dictionary
Message-ID: <000701c46dfb$b744e120$6401a8c0@enterprise>

Hello, all.

I'm using LaTeX to typeset a dictionary. I am using \markboth{}{} to set up
the page headings to state what text is on each page. However, I need to do
this manually. It appears that LaTeX believes the last such directive it
receives on each page.

Is there a more automated way to do this? I run into problems when an entry
ends just prior to a page break. I have worked around this by manually
increasing the space between entries to move the page break into an entry.

Example

\textbf{aardvark} \markboth{aardvark---apple}{aardvark---apple}
An aardvark is an animal...

...

\textbf{apple} An apple is a fruit.
...grows on trees.
%%no problem if page breaks here
...many grown in Washington.
%%problem if page breaks here

\textbf{Argentina} \markboth{Argentina---Azores}{Argentina---Azores}
Argentina is a country in South America...

Thank you for your help.

A simple environment that can solve your problem (maybe a bit
simplistically) is the PSTricks package.  Look at this piece of my old
physics homework:

[-- Start <hw9.ltx> from line 122 to line 137: ------------------------]
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{8cm}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{pspicture}(8cm,4cm)
	\psset{yunit=1cm,xunit=1cm}
	\psset{linewidth=1pt}
	\rput[bl](0,0){\includegraphics[natwidth=8cm,natheight=4cm]{p1}}
	\psdot(5.36,2)
	\rput[b](5.36,2.1){$P$}
	\rput[tl](5.36,1.95){$\underbrace{\hspace{1.6cm}}_{\hbox{$r$}}$}
	\psline{->}(3,0.4)(5,0.4)
	\rput[b](4,0.75){$I$}
	\rput[r](1.4,0.4){$\infty \cdots$}
	\rput[r](1.4,3.6){$\infty \cdots$}
\end{pspicture}
\vspace{-1cm}
\end{wrapfigure}
[-- End <hw9.ltx> from line 122 to line 137. --------------------------]

It includes <p1.eps> (which is a problem model created by POV-Ray) and
overlays a few labels and an axis.  There is, however, a package
specifically for your case: PSfrag.  Also, a not so simple to use, but
certainly powerful package is XYpic (and so is the MetaPost system, I've
heard).  There are other packages for specific tasks (displaying
diagrams, borad games, elecrical circuits, binary trees, and others).
If you have `texdoctk`, you may try looking under ``Graphics'' and
``Diagrams''.

Luck and vision,

There is a rather straightforward way to add text to an .eps figure. Here 
is an example, using psfig:

\begin{document}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\psfig{figure=bluff.eps,height=4.5in}
\vskip-4.5in
\begin{picture} (325,325)
\put(0,0){\circle*{5.20}}
\put(0,325){\circle*{5.20}}
\put(325,0){\circle*{5.20}}
\put(325,325){\circle*{5.20}}
\end{picture}
\vskip4.5in
\vskip-325pt
\caption{Average Contributions over Time}
\label{fgfig}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{document}
Note that 325pt is approximately 4.5in.
I put four little circles near the four corners of the figure. I would 
print this, then use the four circles to locate exactly where you want your 
text, and then add the text and get rid of the circles.

Best,

HG

Hi,

I was intrigued by the two recent posts on how to annonate postscript 
figures using various LaTeX packages.  I usually use Adobe Illustrator to 
perfect my postscript figures that were originally created by other 
programs (e.g., Fortran, IDL).

Does anyone have any opinions regarding the pros and cons of using these 
two methods for creating documents destined for academic journals?

Based on my limited experience, I would imagine that publishers would 
prefer that figures be self-contained into one EPS file.  If that is 
indeed the case, then I would suggest to Bill that he try to get his hands 
on a copy of Adobe Illustrator.

         Illustrator is fine for text, but it doesn't do math very well at 
all. Also, its fonts will generally be different from CM, Mathtime, Lucida, 
or whatever your TeX uses.
         My experience is that publishers want camera-ready figures, not 
eps files. I have had one (MIT Press) that wanted some tiff files, but they 
were fine with pdf plus camera-ready.
         You can make an .eps file from a pdf file, or part of a pdf file, 
though I've never been really happy with the result or the time it took 
(running it through GhostView, for instance).
         BTW, for a LaTeX design system, check my TeXDesign, which can be 
grabbed from my web site. I use it almost exclusively, and have written 
whole books with it.

Best,

HG

You can also have a look at section 41 ``Exporting EPS files'' of the
PSTricks users' guide for education on a possible way to generate <.eps>
files through TeX/LaTeX.

I looked for TeXDesign, but only found an executable to be downloaded.
You don't say for what platform it is.

i looked for it too; once i'd got past the german textile-printing
company ... i found myself a bit disappointed that i couldn't look at
docs to decide whether i needed to add it to the list for the faq.

> You don't say for what platform it is.

i thought that was clear -- widnoze.  there may be docs inside the
exec, of course, but that doesn't help me (unless i'm willing to boot
my long-suffering wife off her machine...).

still i suppose it's in the best m$ traditions -- you open the thing
up before you know what it's for... :-}

Hello,

I've started trying TeXDesign and it seems to be very helpful. I've 
found the following though,

1) TeXDesign creates a file '.txp' such as

\unitlength 1.00mm
\begin{picture}(78.08,85.23)
\TDellipse(65.48,68.11)(14.41,10.64)(30.77,49.40)
\TDcircle(40.63,39.57,29.58)
\TDLine(40.24,86.23)(40.24,1.00)(0.40)
\end{picture}

but when I try to open it with TeXDesign in order to edit it, I get the 
following messagge

'1.00' is not a valid floating point value

and TeXDesign doesn't allow the file be opened.

2) When drawing an ellipse TeXDesign takes too few points on the sharp 
bends (or so it seems).

However TeXDesign allows quick and easy integration of simple geometric 
figures and text in LaTeX (WindowsXP platform).

Thank you Prof. Gintis.

         Good point! The program has a help file, a la windows, so you can 
read the help file. I'll make a doc file for the program.

i do hope you don't mean a word .doc file?  antiword output is _soo_
grotty.

I believe that's the mechanism that xfig uses for the case when the
users want to use TeX formatting of text strings, including mathematics,
in vector figures instead of just some standard PostScript font.

Hi,
 
   While I was typesetting my thesis, some mysterious changes occured to the headings. It was "Chapter 1: introduction", and now it becomes simply "Introduction". I couldn't figure out the difference. The style file that I used defines the headings with the following code.
 
\LoadClass[12pt,letterpaper,onecolumn]{report}[1996/10/31]
 
%% PAGE HEADINGS
\if@twoside
    \def\ps@plain{%
        \def\@evenhead{}\def\@oddhead{}%
        \def\@evenfoot{%
            \null\hfil\rmfamily\thepage\quad{\slshape\leftmark}\hfil\null}%
        \def\@oddfoot{%
            \null\hfil{\slshape\rightmark}\quad\rmfamily\thepage\hfil\null}%
        \def\chaptermark##1{}%
        \def\sectionmark##1{}%
    }
    \def\ps@headings{%
        \def\@evenfoot{}\def\@oddfoot{}%
        \def\@evenhead{%
            \rmfamily\thepage\quad{\slshape\leftmark}\hfil\null}%
        \def\@oddhead{%
            \null\hfil{\slshape\rightmark}\quad\rmfamily\thepage}%
        \def\chaptermark##1{\markboth {##1}{}}%
        \def\sectionmark##1{\markright %
            {\ifnum \c@secnumdepth >\z@ \thesection\ \fi ##1}}%
    }
\else
    \def\ps@plain{%
        \def\@evenhead{}\def\@oddhead{}\def\@evenfoot{}%
        \def\@oddfoot{%
            \null\hfil{\slshape\rightmark}\quad\rmfamily\thepage\hfil\null}%
        \def\chaptermark##1{}%
        \def\sectionmark##1{}%
    }
    \def\ps@headings{%
        \def\@evenfoot{}\def\@oddfoot{}\def\@evenhead{}%
        \def\@oddhead{%
            \null\hfil{\slshape\rightmark}\quad\rmfamily\thepage}%
        \def\chaptermark##1{\markright {##1}{}}%
    }
\fi
 
  The change happens to both twoside and oneside cases. Please point out to me what may cause the change and how to go back to the old heading style. Thanks in advance.

         You have to redefine "chaptermark", which now says to print 
nothing! I don't know what you did, but in the report.cls file, chaptermark 
is chock full of neat stuff.
         You should find report.cls (usually where latex.ltx is), and fix 
it up.

Well, It doesn't work perfectly.  Using the above, I get one figure
waaay at the top of the page, and one waaay at the bottom of the page.
Ideally, I'd like for them to be placed adjacent to the text they follow
in the LaTeX source.  If they won't fit there, for LaTeX to just push
them down the margin.

I.e. here's what I'm getting http://hutnick.com/images/getting.png, and
here's what I'm wanting: http://hutnick.com/images/wanting.png

Thanks!

Hi,
 
Does anybody know how to justify the reference items in IEEE template?
 
I am writing a paper using IEEE template. When the reference number from one digit (e.g. 1, 2, ..., 9) to two digits (e.g. 10, 12, etc.), the blank space between the number and the first letter of the authors moves one space right. I need to adjust it to make it evenly.
 
Thanks.

Thanks, Herbert. I found out that after deleting the code from the class file, the heading works perfectly. The code is apparently useless and shadows the heading definition in report.cls.

Subject: [texhax] hyperref and \resizebox
Message-ID: <006101c47081$997859f0$0200a8c0@steel>

Hi,

 

I have a table containing some text which includes citations (\cite). The
table doesn't fit into the page and I usually address this by wrapping the
table in a \resizebox, as shown below:

 

\begin{table}

\begin{center}

\resizebox{15cm}{!}{\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}

 

 . wide table text, which includes a few citations (\cite) .

 

\end{tabular}}

\end{center}

\caption{bla bla}

\end{table}

 

My problem is that with the hyperref package, the actual citation links do
not appear on the citation text, but on where they would be if I didn't do
the \resizebox.

 

Any ideas why this happens and how I can fix the problem please?

 

Thanks,

Steve

I think the use of the package "tabularx" by David Carlisle est very 
useful of that kind of problems which we can fix the length of the table 
and it calculate automatically the column widths.

Thanks for your quick reply.

The tabularx package looks ideal to fit wide tables in a page. Unfortunately
this is not what I am after at this stage.

As already mentioned, I am resizing tables by using the \resizebox command.
The hyper-references in the table are not appearing in the correct places,
but rather where they should be had I not resized the table.

I need something to address this please.

Thank you,
Steve

Hi Jing,

I took a quick look at the IEEEtran.cls.  I think you can cheat the system by making the following change in the bibliography section.  If anyone else has a better fix, please let us know.

Jim

\def\thebibliography#1{\section*{References}%
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{References}%
% V1.6 add some rubber space here and provide a command trigger
\footnotesize \vskip 0.3\baselineskip plus 0.1\baselineskip minus 0.1\baselineskip%

  Hi,

  Does anybody know how to justify the reference items in IEEE template?

  I am writing a paper using IEEE template. When the reference number from one digit (e.g. 1, 2, ..., 9) to two digits (e.g. 10, 12, etc.), the blank space between the number and the first letter of the authors moves one space right. I need to adjust it to make it evenly.

  Thanks.

  Jing

It there a way to mix the longtable function with
either minipage or multicols so that a table will span
the left half of the page first then then right half? 
I have gotten this to work with the tabbing and table
enviroment as a float but would like the longtable
function.  Any ideas?

Thanks!

Here is one TeX-based approach to this kind of problem:

Well, that would depend upon what computing platform you are using.

GnuPlot and Xfig could be appropriate free-software solutions.

Alternatively, if the academic pricing on Illustrator is available to 
you,
and within your price-range, then that's a high-powered solution.


Hope this helps,

Message-ID: <A850C6B3EB02F044907B475259FFF5650138D6F4@jsc-mail08.jsc.nasa.gov>

Installation question:


I've downloaded the following from your website:

tetex-src.tar.gz
tetex-texmf.tar.gz

I've issued the following commands from the INSTALL file:

# mkdir -p /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf
# gzip -dc tetex-texmf.tar.gz | (umask 0; cd /usr/local/teTex/share/texmf;
tar xvf - )

That works fine.

The next command is not clear:

# cd /usr/local/scr
# gzip -dc tetex-scr.tar.gz | tar xvf -

The 'scr' directory does not exist in our /usr/local directory. Do I create
it?

Should the gzip command be issued to the /usr/local/scr directory?

When I run:

# sh -c ' ./configure -prefix=/usr/local/teTeX >configure.log 2>&1; &

Will this give the results needed?

The following command run from what directory?

# sh -c 'make world >world.log 2>&1' &

After running the 'configure' and 'make' commands listed above, are the
binary files located in the /usr/local/teTeX/bin directory?

Where should the following command be run executed?

# ls | wc -l  # should be 145.

We are currently running Solaris 2.6. Is version 2.0.2 compatible?


In the near future we will be installing this same version on Solaris 2.9.
Is it also compatible?


Please help,
Rick Corbett

Message-ID: <004c01c46fd3$3f34e430$0200a8c0@steel>

Hi,

 

I have a table containing some text which includes citations (\cite). The
table doesn't fit into the page and I usually address this by wrapping the
table in a \resizebox, as shown below:

 

\begin{table}

\begin{center}

\resizebox{15cm}{!}{\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}

 

 . wide table text, which includes a few citations (\cite) .

 

\end{tabular}}

\end{center}

\caption{bla bla}

\end{table}

 

My problem is that with the hyperref package, the actual citation links do
not appear on the citation text, but on where they would be if I didn't do
the \resizebox.

 

Any ideas why this happens and how I can fix the problem please?

 

Thanks,

Steve

Dear Subir,
         You can export your figures as jpegs, and then use jpeg2ps to put 
an .eps wrapper around it. You can edit this with GSView.

Depends.

Which version of Adobe Acrobat do you have?

If you have the full version v5 or 6, open the .pdf, choose ``File | 
Save as...'' and pick .eps in the format pop-up menu.

In the full version v4, I believe it's an export option.

If you only have Adobe Acrobat/Reader you've a bit more work to do:

  - install a decent Postscript printer driver
  - open the file in Adobe Acrobat
  - Print to a PostScript file of type ``EPS'' with appropriate settings.

Dear Ky Anh -- The TeX primitive \uppercase is /very/ anomolous
in terms of the timing of its operation (you would need to read
/The TeXbook/ in great detail to completely understand its
operation) which is one reason why Leslie Lamport (or possibly
Messrs Mittelbach et al -- I don't know who actually implemented
it) provided a more robust and consistent replacement for LaTeX users.

Even serious plain TeX hackers sometimes have problems understanding
the exact timing of \uppercase, so I wouldn't worry too much if you
don't : just use the LaTeX equivalent instead!)

it's generally thought bad form to post simultaneously to two forums,

odd that your post to texhax takes so much longer to get to me than

doesn't sound like it to me (and indeed it doesn't occur in the
absence of babel greek of any sort -- nb i only know modern greek).
it would take rather extreme coding to decide to change the catcode of
a letter.  far more likely is a boundary character ligature, as
vladimir suggests -- except at a cursory glance (i've installed the
fonts since i started typing ... helps to maintain a ctan mirror at
home, and a sunday morning to play) i can't find the ligature in the
table.

however, while i see your problem, i don't really understand your
premise.  the only circumstance i can imagine needing a non-terminal
sigma is in an instructional manual, and in that case it's easy enough
to do a fiddle like yours with alpha (though i personally wouldn't
code it like you did...).

my guess is there's no context sensitivity in babel greek (for sure,
none is needed in this area) -- it's all in the font.  and there is
notoriously no way to switch off ligature effects in tex.  :-(

incidentally, knuth's test \lowers, in testfont, is particularly
useless in this case, since it would appear not to allow any two
letters to ligature -- every sigma in it appears as a terminal sigma.
even \names only produces one medial sigma that i can see (which has
me boggling about how he implements that test ... i can imagine such
an infelicity in \lowers).

nb, i've placed reply-to texhax in the header.  *please* don't post
general tex questions to pdftex or tex-live -- this isn't a pdftex or

well, it appeared that it's not about catcodes, etc - it was a
boundary character ligature (in the font gk7t.tfm) which makes it hard
to input non-final sigma as a separate character.

You can use this:

\def\finalsigma{\noboundary c\noboundary}
\def\nonfinalsigma{\noboundary s\noboundary}

because it's comparing the token \filename (which is unexpandable)
with the token f, a doomed exercise.

\edef\tempa{\the\filename}
\def\tempb{file6}

It would be most helpful if you indicate which OS you use. Metafont is 
included with nearly every TeX distribution, so if you have installed 
TeX, you should have Metafont. I would suggest looking at 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/.

Message-ID: <20040727072347.20021.qmail@web52909.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I am creating a Latex document and I want to cite in
it some Java programs, the sources of which reside in
some text files. I do not want to copy and paste their
contents in my latex document, because I should
synchronize the code in the latex document with the
code of the actual programs. Can yo give an advice to
include them?
I tried with
\input{MyProgram.java}, 
but it wasn't displayed correctly, because some
symbols as {, } and newlines were skipped.

Thank you very much in advance

Regards 
Ivan Ivanov

P.S. I remember once I saw some C++ source files
included in latex documents so I believe it will be
similar for Java ones too.

You might consider using 'lgrind' package.  And take a look at

  http://tug.org/~cvr/lgrind.pdf

to see what lgrind can do for you.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0407261932150.12330-100000@gila.hep.utexas.edu>

Hi,

I have an entry in my thesis that refers to a photograph taken from a 
website.  My first thought was to BibTex it like this:

@misc{foobar,
author="{Foobar Media Services}",
howpublished = "\url{http://www.foobar.gov}"
}


The cite appears as:

[34] .  Foobar Media Services, http://www.foobar.gov
     ^
     |
   This period is the problem.  BibTeX apparently wants a first name.  
Can anyone suggest what I might do to rid myself of this period?  I have
some additional citations with the same problem.  These are documents
written by an amorphous group of people and have no identifiable single
author.  They do however have a title, date, etc.  Here is an example

@misc{foobar,
author="{The Idiot Collaboration}",
title="{S}ome {B}aloney",
month="October",
year="2000"
}

This would be printed like:

[1] . The Idiot Collaboration,{ ..... }

Again, the little dot.

I know that the behaviour is somewhat dependent on the bst file I use, but 
I'm stuck with it.  Possibly I can modify it but I'd rather not if there 
is some way to fool bibtex.

Best Regards,

Mike Kordosky

if you read texhax, your copy of your own post would have contained

the behaviour is exclusively a property of the bibstyle you're using
(the bibtex standard styles don't do this) -- here's plain.bst output
from your two bibitems:

  \begin{thebibliography}
  \bibitem{foobar}
  {Foobar Media Services}.
  \newblock \url{http://www.foobar.gov}.

  \bibitem{tic}
  {The Idiot Collaboration}.
  \newblock {S}ome {B}aloney, October 2000.
  \end{thebibliography}

unless we're told _what_ bibstyle you're using, we don't stand a
chance -- we simply can't guess what it's trying (and failing) to put
in that first block.

(does bibtex not produce error messages about something missing? -- a
standard style would.)

Of course, you are right.  Sorry for omitting the style file.  I thought
that perhaps there was a typical work-around for a case like this.  I've
included the offending bibstyle with this message though I don't suppose
anyone really wants to dig into it!  The file was taken from:

http://www-spires.fnal.gov/spires/hep/bibstyles.html

The site (SPIRES) is a citation database popular with particle physicists.

It doesn't produce any error in the document.blg or .log.

I suspect that the error might be in this function in the bst file:

FUNCTION {format.names}
{ 's :=
#1 'nameptr :=
s num.names$ 'numnames :=
numnames #3 >
s numnames "{ll}" format.name$ "others" = numnames #1 > and
or 'etal :=
etal
{ #1 #1 + 'namesleft := }
{ numnames 'namesleft := }
if$
{ namesleft #0 > }
{ s nameptr "{f{.}}. {vv~}{ll}{, jj}" format.name$ 't :=
nameptr #1 >
{ namesleft #1 >
{ ", " * t * }
{ t "others" =
etal or
{ " et~al." * }
{ " and " * t * }
if$
}
if$
}
't
if$
nameptr #1 + 'nameptr :=
namesleft #1 - 'namesleft :=
}
while$
}

However, I know zero about the bibtex language and can't learn right now!

Unless someone can easily see the error I will probably just try to find 
another similar style.

Thanks for the help!

Best Regards,

Mike Kordosky

Does anybody know how to enable "description" (similar to itemize and enumerate) in IEEE template? I got the following words in the document IEEEtran.cls
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% v1.6b provide original LaTeX IED list environments

% note that latex.ltx defines \itemize and \enumerate, but not \description

% which must be created by the base classes

% save original LaTeX itemize and enumerate

Subject: [texhax] Conditional Splitting of a Table
Message-ID: <41079126.7030008@fluent.co.in>

Hi,

I have table that runs into three pages in print.

So that the column headings appear on each page in print (pdf) I have 
split the table into three.
However, I would like an un-split single table when I convert it to HTML.

I tried enclosing the intermediate \end{table} \begin{table} .... 
commands in \begin{latexonly}\end{latexonly}
but this gives an error and the second half of the table disappears even 
in the latex version.

Is there any other way this can be done?

\begin{table}[hbtp]
\caption{Long Table}
\label{split-tab}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1in}|p{1.5in}|} \hline
{\bf 1} & {\bf 2} \\ \hline
a & b \\ \hline
c & d \\ \hline
*\begin{latexonly} *
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\begin{table}[hbtp]
\begin{tabular}{|p{1in}|p{1.5in}|} \hline
{\bf 1} & {\bf 2 } \\ \hline
*\end{latexonly} *
e & f \\ \hline
g & h \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
 

Thanks

Have you tried longtable package? I guess, it should solve your
problems.

any number of things.  given that we don't know what tex system you're
using, even, it's hard to guess (file searching is system-dependent).

Hi listers,

I use the geometry package to set page layout for my documents, however the 
settings have to be specified in th preamble, and I can't create a document 
with several page layouts in it.

I have tried to use \oddsidemargin, \evensidemargin, etc, but with poor 
results.

Any ideas on how I can do this?

Hello,

The vmargin package should work for me, however when I tried it  I couldn't 
get control of the textwidth. Here is an example:

-------------------------------------------------
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{report} 

\begin{document}

\setpapersize{A4}
%\setmargins{ leftmargin }{ topmargin }{ textwidth }{ textheight }
{ headheight }{ headsep }{ footheight }{ footskip }
\setmargins{ 0cm }{ 0cm }{ 1cm }{ 1cm }{ 0cm }{ 0cm }{ 0cm }{ 0cm }

Asdfasdf asd fas dfa sdf as df asdf as fd as df a df as dfas df asd er t try 
hg dfgh  v fas fsadfasfkjhwertbsdf adsf as dfas df asd fa sdf asd 
fqweriousdlkfjhs fg sdlkjhqwerpoiudsf asdflkhasdkj asdlkfhaqh+as+df as df
+asoifalkjhdf bncvnmbx a df a,smdfmnbxncv xcv mxcvbnxcvbxmnb

\end{document}
---------------------------------------------------

This should print a text with 1 cm width, but does not. It prints text with a 
constant width regardless of the parameters used in setmargins.

Any ideas?

of course, that doesn't work at all since you've not included the
package...

you can't "just change margins" after \begin{document} -- tex doesn't
have the means of flowing from one text size to another in the middle
of a page, so to first order it ignores the command.

add the package, move the commands between it and \begin{document} and
(assuming it doesn't complain about your weird parameters) it might
have some effect.

the central cambridge university switches, etc., will all be down from
about 08:00 to 17:00 next sunday 2004-08-01.  the university will keep
needing more central facilities and the entire backup power supply is
to be replaced.  as a result, all the cambridge ctan services will be
inaccessible for that period.  (we don't take power from the centre,
so at least our machines ought to survive the down-time.)

my apologies for the inconvenience; among other things, it will allow
even more under-used bandwidth to the cambridge ctan.

For a biological article I need empasized biological names in the

How can I emphasize single keywords in the BibTex-file?
something like:

keyword-list:
name1
name2
...
FUNCTION {format.keyword}
{ keyword emphasize

for all keywords

Can one help?

I am looking for a way to have an array such that adjacent text to the
left is vertically aligned with the top row and adjacent text to the
right is vertically aligned with the bottom row.  That is exactly what
one needs for typesetting code, using macros for each syntactic form, 
but it seems to violate fundamental constraints of tex.  I am aware of
alltt and lstlisting, but would prefer to generate the code using 
macros.

Is there any way get this effect?

Consider BibTool --- much better than looking below:
