Subject: [texhax] LaTeX and Type 1 fonts in Illustrator 10 under Windows ME
Message-ID: <4092D207.4030600@eecs.berkeley.edu>

Has anyone been able to resolve this problem.  It's quite annoying not 
being able to re-open files.  I find that if I just edit the file, I can 
import the EPS file with no problems.  But in the process of re-opening 
the file in Illustrator, the fonts get screwed up.

Thanks,

Ali

Dear all,

I have written a javascript program that converts some latex commands

Before making a decision, I would advice you to take a look at these 
web sites:

http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/

and

http://www.rna.nl/tex.html

There is also a truly helpful mailing list for TeX on Mac OS X, to

How does this compare to latex2html and tex4ht? Both are mature packages to 
convert LaTeX to HTML (tex4ht can do much more actually, including html).

    Are the Postscript packages included in the TEX-Collection or the CTAN
    distributions? 

I assume you meant the 35 standard PostScript fonts which originally
come from URW.  The answer is yes, they are on both (and included in
every other TeX distribution I know of).

    And if they are includeds and I sign up now, when can I expect to
    receive these disks..

If you're talking about signing up with TUG, probably a few days?
Depends on the post office, usually we ship within a couple days of any
order.

    Instead of waiting for snail-mail can I just down load them? 

Certainly.  To download them by themselves, CTAN is the best,
www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/psfonts/urw/base35, among other places.

Installing them from scratch into a running setup is not the easiest
thing in the world, there are hints in the Type 1 Installation Guide
(ctan/info/Type1fonts) and Formatting Information (ctan/info/beginlatex)
documents.

Or you could download a complete distribution.  See
http://tug.org/begin.html for some recommendations on that.

After thinking on this a bit more, I hit upon the idea of using the

I suspect that if you removed the non-breaking spaces you'd find that 
its addition forces a nicer set of linebreaks for a paragraph --- 
certainly that last would seem to indicate it, esp. if you meant 
paragraph.

Thanks. So it has nothing to do with the indefinite article. Good to
know.

Dear Sirs

I am an almost beginner at using latex with WinEdt and I installed the 
package "fancyhdr" from MikTex options (Packages) to get different 
pagestyle options.
After downloading the files and updating, now I try to compile my document 
and see the DVI preview and I get an error message like

This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (MiKTeX 2.1)
! I can't find file `Chapter21.tex'.
<*> Chapter21.tex

Please type another input file name:

I have no idea how to get out of it. I tried with other documents in other 
directories but I get the same message. Why did MikTex change the way I 
used to compile and view my files? I am afraid I might have removed some 
important file while downloading the package...
Thank you to anyone who can help me

That's not my impression at all, and /may/ not be what was implied
by William Adams : a "nicer set of linebreaks" may well imply
"far fewer lines ending with the indefinite article", which I for
one would regard as a Very Good Thing.  When typesetting high-quality
material, I always suppress line breaks after the indefinite article,
and in several other fairly well-defined places as well ...

Subject: [texhax] generating printed forms with LaTeX
Message-ID: <4097D11C.3090903@binghamton.edu>

I'm working up a proposal for a research project.  Much of my writing 
regarding the study is already in .tex files.  Now I have to "pitch" the 
project to the approviing authorities.  I'd like to prepare a written 
proposal and an on-screen presentation.  I have some experience with 
prosper and seminar packages, so I think I can do that fairly easily. 
But the study involves some questionairres that the subject will fill 
out.  I obviously have to include a copy of the survey instrument in the 
written proposal.  Of course I could do up the survey in my word 
processor of choice.  But I'm wondering if their are good and convenient 
ways to to it in LaTeX, so I can have all my stuff in one place/format. 
  The survey instrument would be the typical, highly formatted, form, 
with fill-in-the-blank questions, put-an-X-on-the-line questions, maybe 
some horizontal line dividers, and many Likert-type scales, with a stem 
question on the left and then numerical choices of 1 through 5 spaced 
out evenly to the right.  Am I crazy to think of doing this layout in 
LaTeX?  Or is there a nice package?

Thanks.

Hmm. So we are back to the question. First, there are plenty places in
texbook.tex, where Knuth *didn't* put `~' after the indefinite
article. And second, neither Chicago Manual of Style, nor Bringhurst
even mention such rule.

IMHO line break after the indefinite article is not bad, because it
makes curios about the rest of the sentence. Of course it makes not
much sense, to make curios of sth. that ends right on the next line.

Message-ID: <4097F10C.2060205@mun.ca>

Dear list,

I've recently joined texhax and, because I haven't found any answers in 
the documentation and the archives, I'm turning to you for help on BibTeX.

I've successfully transfered my reference file from Endnote to BibTeX, 
but am having problems with journal abbreviations. Endnote handles these 
by letting you put the complete journal name in the database, and then 
defining any abbreviations you want in a 'terms' list. This is good 
because one can keep the database 'clean' and interchangeable with other 
database formats, as the fields contain the raw information. BibTeX, if 
I understand the documentation correctly, prefers you enter a one word 
shorthand for the journal, and then defining strings for the full 
journal name and abbreviation separately, in 'string' commands, or 
defining macros in a style file. I find this very incovenient because if 
one ever needs to transfer the database to another format (e.g. Endnote, 
etc.), one is left with the shorthand version of the journal names, 
which don't mean anything outside BibTeX. Additionally, one would have 
to replace the full journal names in the database with a shorthand, and 
then create all the 'string' commands to define full and abbreviated 
names. This seems too much.

Is there a better way to create abbreviations without changing the 
actual 'journal' field in the database?

I'd greatly appreciate your help with this. Thanks a lot in advance.

Sebastian

Have a look at the exam class if you are not planning on using an
electronic form.  For a powerful bundle of packages that will enable you
to do most of what you can imagine (including PDF forms with JavaScript
that accepts only ``possible'' answers, grade quizzes, output to HTML,
etc.) have a look at the AcroTeX eDucation bundle (

	webeqman_p.pdf
	
in your *TeX distribution, or

I don't have experience with software interoperability or abbreviations,
but I have some suggestions.

Replacing long names with string concatenation operators in a ``.bib''
database (or vice versa) is a one-line SED, AWK, Ruby, or Perl script.
(Excluding the definitions of strings that contain the abbreviations).

Alternatively, you can write a short style definition (``.bst'') that
does the same job (expands variables, or replaces strings in particular
fields of the ``.bib'' database with desired values).

As a last alternative, you can use TeX to replace strings in fields
(redefine \bibitem ??).  This solution will involve longer code and will
probably run considerably slower than the alternatives.  (I can send you
some TeX code for token list, i.e. string, manipulation).

There may well be ready solutions to your problem, though.

Hello,
         It is about the latex4web package (Eric Chopin). I checked the 
package and is still quite deficient on the latex side. Apart from 
additions to that, with some reworking (especially in using 
light-weight/custom browsers ) it can be used as a previewer for Kile in 
particular.

Subject: [texhax] French Hyphenation
Message-ID: <4099B755.2010603@arrowsash.com>

Greetings.  I just recently joined TUG and hope to learn lots. This is 
my first post on this list, so if it is off topic for the list kindly 
point me in the right direction.

On the project I am doing at work we use TeX only incidentally.  The 
main print engine on the project uses the Antenna House XSL-FO engine. 
This engine uses the TeX hyphenation algorithm.  I am temporarily using 
Antenna House with a French hyphenation dictionary borrowed from 
OpenOffice, which also uses the same algorithm as TeX.  However, I need 
to improve this hyphenation dictionary.   The Antenna House engine 
requies that the patterns TeX hyphenation patterns be marked up in a 
specific form of XML.

I have looked at the French LaTeX hyphenation dictionary, and would like 
to borrow the patterns in, and mark it up in the XML format required by 
Antenna House.  The problem is, I don't understand coding TeX or LaTeX 
well enough to interpret the stuff in the French TeX/LaTeX hyphenation 
dictionary with any confidence.

Could anyone help me interpret the coding in the hyphenation 
dictionary?  Or, if someone knows some good reading that would help me, 
I would appreciate it.  I own two LaTeX books, and the hardbound Knuth 
series on TeX.  However, I would like to get this project done without 
learning it all from scratch, since I have a deadline to meet.

Any help is appreciated.

Message-ID: <16538.11506.239918.757331@sparkle.daimi.au.dk>


I encountered a weird problem. Consider:

  \documentclass[a4paper]{article}
  \begin{document}
  \fontsize{12}{14pt}\selectfont % Works fine
  %\fontsize{14}{17pt}\selectfont% Does not work, i.e. does not stretch
  \noindent\begin{minipage}[c][100mm][s]{\textwidth}
  XXX
  \vfill
  YYY
  \vfill
  ZZZ
  \end{minipage}
  \end{document}

If I choose \fontsize{12}{14pt}\selectfont, the minipage works as expected
(stretched vertically to 100mm). However, if I choose \fontsize{14}{17pt},
there is no stretch: minipage collapses and gives an overfull box:

 Overfull \vbox (34.04004pt too high) detected at line 11

Is it a bug or a feature?

Hi David,

Thanks for joining TUG :).

    Could anyone help me interpret the coding in the hyphenation dictionary?

Here are some sources, not all of which are necessarily consistent with
each other, but which might be enough to get you going:

- appendix H of the TeXbook gives the basic idea.  Sadly, I don't
  believe Liang's thesis is available online, not even sure if it's
  available from Stanford.

- the program itself:
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/knuth/unsupported/texware/patgen.web

- material by Petr Sojka and David Antos:
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xantos/patlib/

- the tutorial by Yannis Haralambous:
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/patgen2.tutorial

I'm not sure who created the French patterns specifically, but they
might be able to help too.

The good news is that you don't have to learn anything about TeX or
LaTeX to do this.  The hyphenation patterns and algorithm are completely
separate.

Hope this helps,
karl

Well, you are using the koma-script package and there doesn't seem to be
much freedom beyond straight brutal hacking, i.e., redefing the relevant
pieces of code.

If you really, really need to use scrbook, then try playing with the
definition of \@@makecaption (line 1680 of the present scrbook.cls).  The
best way to do this is to cut and paste the defnition into your preamble
(between a \makeatletter ... \makeatlother) pair and then hack away!  You
might also try playing with other packages such as caption2, but you may run
into compatibility problems.

Otherwise, drop koma-script and use more generic packages.

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

For C code, you can always try CWEB, FWEB and GNOME's doc tools, i.e.
gnome-doc, (output DocBook, HTML, plain text or man-page format, no
TeX).

You may want to try funnelweb for both C and MatLab (I have no
experience).  And, of course, simply including code listings with LaTeX
code in the comments is supported by the listings package.

You might also look at Doxygen ( http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ )
which works with various source files and can generate html, latex, rtf,
pdf, ... formats. It's designed for various programming languages
(C,C++,IDL, ...), and will even generate documentation on the code
structure which doesn't contain any doxygen-specific comments,  but can
also be "abused" for more general documentation.

correctly. On the contrary, when I try to convert them to PS or PDF
overlays works fine, but only a small portion of my slide is rendered: it
seems like the viewers are reading them in Portrait mode and the
remaining part of the slide is lost.

I'm currently using WindowsXP, Miktex and TexnicCenter...
I tried to compile my Latex file with a Linux machine, but the problem
seems to remain....

I cannot thank you guys enough on the great job of getting the
Tex Collection to load and configure as easily as it does.

As a long time PcTex user I am estatic over the tools you guys
provide and how well the whole system operates under Window XP.

Now I just need to brush up on Emacs and I will be on my way.

I have found a few things however I believe you can easily
either fix or let me know of a simple workaround.

As a lecturer I prepare all my presentations using the Seminar package
by Denis GIROU.

That package requires the caption2.sty, the hbaw.sty & hcolor.sty styles
which are not
included on your Ftp site ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/fptex/current/package/ Also
I noticed
that the CTAN support/thumbpdf directory site does not include the
thumbpdf.cfg file required
of the Seminar package.

I have included these files.

1. Please let me know if you guys plan to include these packages at a later
date.

2. I also noticed that Latex launched from inside the EMACS tool would not
pick up
these style files even though they are in the local directory where I
located the
rest of the seminar files.

3. Should I put all these non-packaged styles in a common directory and
include that
in the path?

4. How best should I proceed?

5. How or can I create my own TPM files under XP so that I can register them
with the
installation?

- Thanks

Although tb74flynn.pdf remains online for historical purposes, Peter has
released a newer version than the one printed in TUGboat (and will
continue to do so).  The changes are mostly minor errata that he
received after the TUB issue was published, but you might as well

Hello Haig,

Thanks for the kind words.  TeX Live is an incredible group effort, it's
always nice to get good feedback :).

    1. Please let me know if you guys plan to include these packages at
    a later date.

caption2.sty was included in TeX Live 2003.  It's strange that it's not
included in fpTeX.

hbaw.sty and hcolor.sty were included in TL <= 7, but not in TL2003,
even though the source file fvrb-ex.dtx is in TL 2003.  I don't know
what's up with that.  Sebastian, do you recall this?  (See
http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2004-May/002066.html for Haig's original
message.)

It would be good if thumbpdf.cfg was included in either the thumbpdf or
seminar packages itself.  Or if that setting \ThumbpdfDriver{dvips} was
simply the default, so no .cfg was needed.  Could you write to the
thumbpdf author about that?

    3. Should I put all these non-packaged styles in a common directory and
    include that
    in the path?

Yes, that is probably the best way for you to proceed.  Probably in a
new `local' directory.

    5. How or can I create my own TPM files under XP so that I can
    register them with the installation?

TPM files are plain text files in a simple XML format, so you can
probably make a new one fairly easily, starting from one in the
distribution.  However, getting fpTeX to recognize the new TPM, I have
no idea about, sorry.  Perhaps Fabrice would have some tips.  If there's
no answer here, I can only suggest writing to fptex@tug.org.

Best regards,
karl

Run 'mktexlsr' to make sure they will be found. 
Also, if the command:
C:\Source\TeXLive\Master\Tools>kpsecheck --shared
Kpathsea file mapping is set up.

Syas that kpathsea is loaded, you may have to end or kill any tex relate
process (usually, quitting xemacs and getting back should do it).

$TEXMFLOCAL/tex/latex/... is the place where to put your files.

Don't need to do that for a couple of files.

caption2.sty has been superseded by a revised caption.sty[*].  there is
a "compatibility" version of caption2 distributed with it and i'm
slightly surprised that fptex doesn't have that with its caption
offering.

[*] caption2 was originally an interim updated version of caption, so
the roles have been re-reversed.

Thanks for your quick help.  I have been fuzzy for many years on the distinction between TEX and LATEX.  When I switched to processing with LATEX the problem disappeared.

Hi John,

I highly recommend using Gerben Wierda's gwTeX distribution, which is based on teTeX along with several additional packages from TeXLive, and comes with an elegant package manager (i-Installer). You can find it at:

<http://www.rna.nl/tex.html>

That said, I also recommend the TeX-on-MacOSX mailing list:

>Please see <http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/> for list
>guidelines, information, and LaTeX/TeX resources.

With gwTeX, TeX will be aware of a texmf directory created in your ~/Library, where you can store all self-defined maps etc.

HTH,

Jan

A little bit of trial and error got me to this set of class options (note,
in particular, the portrait option):

\documentstyle[%
  slidesonly,%  Try notes or notesonly instead.
  %notes,%      Use instead of slidesonly to typeset the notes.
  %notesonly,%  Use instead of slidesonly to typeset notes and slides.
  %semcolor,%   Try me if using PSTricks.
  semrot,%     Try me if using Rokicki's dvips.
  %semhelv,%    Try me if using a PostScript printer.
  %article,%    Try me.
  portrait,%   Try me.
  sem-a4,%     Try me if using A4 paper.
  semlayer%     This must be included, but you need the semcolor option to
  ]{seminar}                                  % actually see the overlays.

Run LaTeX then convert to ps (with something like dvi2ps -P pdf -t A4) or to
pdf (or use pdflatex.

You may also use p (classic LaTeX) or b instead of m.

its all part of the problem of taking package X from CTAN and making it 
into TL package X. Things in a "contrib" directory
are just a mess, so often (as it this case) get ignored. Unless fancyvrb 
comes in a rational structure
amenable to automated processing, its hard to know what to do.

Hello again.

I now have a second question:

I want to know if there is a font already available that includes both 
upper- and lower-case letters in a style approximating 15th or early 
16th-century handwriting (I'm trying to write some macros for musixtex 
to make Old German organ tablature). I've found some useful symbols in 
the fonts lute-8 and lute-9, but I'd like to know if there is a more 
complete alphabet out there already, or if there are descriptions posted 
somewhere of the fonts in CTAN (since very few have samplers).

macro exist, and if so, in which TeX distribution or package can I find 
it? Is it a LaTeX thing?

Hello Frauke,

    1. I want to make an inventory of what fonts I currently have installed, 

Unfortunately it is not easy to determine the names of every font
installed.  And you probably don't really want *every* font, anyway.
(Many fonts are installed under several names, using different encoding
vectors.)

    called \fontchart, which can be used in making a font sampler. Does this 
    macro exist, and if so, in which TeX distribution or package can I find 
    it? Is it a LaTeX thing?

It seems to be a plain TeX test file.  Just do tex fontchart.  See for
example
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/TeTeX-HOWTO-3.html

There's also a file called testfont.tex (tex testfont) which has
additional options.

    upper- and lower-case letters in a style approximating 15th or early 
    16th-century handwriting

humanist?
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/bookhands/humanist/


For more info, see also http://tug.org/fonts/, which includes links to a
few different pre-made samplers including many of the CTAN fonts.  I
don't know of anything that attempts to be comprehensive, though.

Subject: [texhax] exam class
Message-ID: <40A2F087.4090201@binghamton.edu>

Thanks for the tip on exam class.  I think it will serve my purposes in 
designing a self-report survey instrument for a research project.

In playing around with it, trying to learn it, I came across an 
interesting dilemma.  I am running tetex on Libranet Linux (a 
commercialized Debian.)  I installed "tetex-extras," so I have just 
about every latex package known to man.  In fact, I have two packages 
named exam, and one named examdesign.

One exam package is by Phillip Hirschorn and does not contain any 
special environment for multiple choice questions.  From the 
documentation, it looks like it is mainly for typesetting 
"show-your-work" math exams.

The other exam package is by Jason Alexander.  It contains environments 
specifically for multiple choice questions, true-false, short essay, 
etc.  For my survey, I think the multiple choice will be most relevant.

Both packages are "called" with the same opening line:  documentclass{exam}

So here's the rub:  my Kile calls up Hirshorn's package in response to 
that command.  Hirschorn's package doesn't seem to know what to do with 
the \begin{multiplechoice} command, and I get errors.

Any suggestions on how to specify the Alexander exam package (which I 
think is the same as the examdesign package--it also uses 
\documentclass{exam} declaration, merely adding to the confusion.)

Or alternatively, how would I remove the Hirschorn exam package from my 
Linux system?

Thanks.

i am very sorry about this: we try to catch duplicate names when we put
things on the archive, but we failed spectacularly here, and people
continue to have problems.

when we realised the problem, we wrote to the author of the second one
and asked him to change the name, and he refused :-(  [i don't recall
which is which, but i suspect the more functional one is the one whose
name we wanted to change.]

we need to take more decisive action; whatever it is, it will cause
yet more inconvenience to users such as you.

in the mean time, i suggest you delete the hirschhorn's package from
your system (there will continue to be trouble so long has you have two
exam.cls on your system).  here's a recipe:

  kpsewhich exam.cls
  # now, as root:
  rm `kpsewhich exam.cls`
  # now move alexander's into place
  cp exam.cls <location shown by kpsewhich above>
  texhash
  # end of root interlude

i'll ensure that whatever action we manage to take gets broadcast to
texhax as well as to the usual suspects (ctan-ann mailing list and hence
newsgroup comp.text.tex)

First of all, just for general information, such a problem is very unlikely
to have anything to do with either MiKTeX of WinEdt.  What is actually moe
use is to have a listing of your preamble, i.e., the class used and all
packages loaded.

> When I don't use the harvard package in my document, bibtex works fine

Note that BibTeX works according to the bst called, which can be independent

I'm not familiar with the harvard packages (as an aside, I would recommend
natbib as more flexible) but I do have a couple of useful tips:

1) if you chop and change packages always delete the .aux file(s) as they
may contain commands that have become undefined or incompatibe citation
formats;

2) you usually need to run LaTeX TWICE after BibTeX to get rid of the ?.

Moreover, although I'm not sure about harvard, in natbib at least the
author-year citation format is disabled automatically if citations without,
e.g., an author are found.

Subject: [texhax] Any MusiXTeX people out there?
Message-ID: <40A59B89.4010402@videotron.ca>

Hello!

If there's anyone out there that uses MusiXTeX, perhaps you can answer 
this question for me:
I'm trying to insert musical examples into a plain-TeX file. Some of 
them look fine, but others (made as "extracts" rather than "pieces") 
become much wider than the page (lacking linebreaks) or have odd bits of 
white space. Now, here's the situation:

Example A (an "extract") has no linebreaks (it seems to be about 4 times 
as wide as the page).
Example B (a "piece") looks fine.

I change example A to be a "piece" as well.

Now: example A looks fine.
Example B is all messed up.

I don't understand why changing example A should have any effect on 
example B, since each of these examples is input as a seperate file, 
with all the MusiXTeX stuff called inside a closed set of brackets. What 
might I be overlooking?

Thanks,
Frauke.

your system (if properly installed in the first place) already has a
substantial bunch of stuff aimed at support of swedish.

you need to start by integrating swedish hyphenation into your system
(this may involve downloading the hyphenation patterns, a 34k file).

see http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=newlang

the actual sehyph.tex, if it's not already on your system, is to be
found at http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/language/hyphenation/sehyph.tex

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

in your latex files, will enable fonts that will permit accents in words
with inflected characters in them.

then

\usepackage[swedish]{babel}

will set up latex to use swedish conventions (including swedish words
for things like chapters).

Hello!
Perhaps this is the wrong place for this question. If so, please tell me!
I'm trying to learn metafont, working through the metafontbook. The 
first running attempt should go as follows:

** \relax
* drawdot (35,70); showit;

This is supposed to give me a dot. Instead, I get the following message:

mf: Window support for X was not compiled into this binary.
mf: To do so, rerun configure --with-x, recompile, and reinstall.
mf: (Or perhaps you just failed to specify the mode.)

Since I didn't do the installation of metafont myself, I am not sure how 
it was done in the first place. Can someone tell me how/where best to do 
this?

I expect you're using teTeX or TeX Live.
Run mfw instead of mf.

Unfortunately, when I run mfw in TL 2003 (under GNU/Linux), the window
comes up, but the dot does not appear.  I hope it works for you.

For TL2004, plain "mf" will have the interactive features again,
or so I understand.  Hopefully they will even work :).

Thanks for the quick response!
I tried it. Unfortunately, it didn't work: "Command not found".
Something must be really messed up in my installation, which in itself 
would be nothing new!
I wandered through the /usr/bin, and found mf and mft, but no mfw. Then 
I searched for it, but no mfw.
What exactly is mfw, and where can I find it?

    What exactly is mfw, and where can I find it?

It was the "window-enabled version" of mf.  The idea was that linking
with the X libraries is a real headache, and makes the binary huge,
while the vast majority sites only use mf to create already-existing
fonts at different resolutions, for which online display is not needed.

Anyway, here are some options, none great.

(1) You can get the mfw from TL2003 from
ftp://tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/bin/i386-linux/mfw.
I must correct what I said earlier, this does draw online for me, but
sometimes it takes two showit's.  I don't understand.  Maybe it will
work for you, I hope there won't be shared lib problems.

(2) You can get the latest teTeX from
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/unix/teTeX and teTeX-beta -- but
this will require building from source.  That might be easy, or it might
be a nightmare.  (If you do get it compiled, you might be able to run mf
directly out of the source tree, or you might have to actually install
everything.)

(3) I don't know what package format Mandrake uses, but perhaps you can
find an updated teTeX to install.

Happy drawing,
karl

  Maybe you need upgrade your Mandrake Linux. MDK-8.2 use
  the old(1.0.7) teTeX system.

  On my Mandrake 9.2 box, mf is link to mfw.

  Or maybe you can get the source rpm from Mandrake-9.2(any mirror
  site you find it) and rebuild it(I never try it).

  get /somewhere/tetex-2.0.2-xxmdk.src.rpm (xx is revised number)
  rpm -i tetex-2.0.2-xxmdk.src.rpm
  rpmbuild -bb /usr/src/RPM/SPECS/tetex.spec
  The binary rpm will at /usr/src/RPM/RPMS/i586/ directory.

Subject: [texhax] One-sided booklet masters
Message-ID: <000701c43dbb$8d3117c0$11317883@rhshudde>

For many years I've been using dvidvi to produce booklets 
using the formula provided in the dvidvi readme file, namely:

   4:-1,2(4.25in,0in)
   4:-3,0(4.25in,0in)
        Useful for printing a little booklet, four pages to a 
        sheet, double-sided, for stapling in the middle.  
        Print the first one, put the stack back into the 
        printer upside down, and print the second.  The `in' 
        specifications are superfluous. 

This has been fine for printing single booklets even though 
the resulting sequence of pages is something only a computer 
scientist could love, with the final collation having to be 
rearranged by hand.

Now I would like to print one-sided masters for export so that 
the recipient can give the stack to someone (say Kinko's) 
without TeX fonts for final back-to-back printing and stapling 
in booklet form.

For example, for a 14 page booklet, the "dvidvi" should 
produce a single dvi file with the following sequence of 8 
single sided sheets: 
      --   1
       2  --
      14   3
       4  13
      12   5
       6  11
      10   7
       8   9

If I can generate a dvi file with this sequence, then I can 
easily convert the result to a pdf file which the (duplex?) 
printer can then print back-to-back for stapling. 

Any suggestion would be much appreciated. 

Thank you.

I have used quire.tex for plain TeX -- I am a plain user ;>} -- though 
it is listed as 'generic' so may work with LaTeX if you are that way 
inclined.

Otherwise, there is the psutils utilities (look on CTAN). Matthew Harris
suggested this:

   dvips -f -q -Z file.dvi | psbook -q -s16 | \
      psnup -q -pletter -W5.5in -H8.5in -2 | \
      pstops -q -pletter '2:0,1U(8.5in,11in)'

"The psbook command arranges the pages into signatures (16 pages = 4
sheets per signature), psnup puts to pages side-by-side on a sheet,
and pstops rotates every other sheet 180 degrees (since my printer
does duplex over the long edge by default).  This assumes that your
printer can do duplex.  If not, replace the quoted string by '2:0' to
get the even pages and '2:1' to get the odd pages, and feed the paper
through twice."

This should get you started.

If you want a .pdf, I'd suggest using the LaTeX package pdfpages --- 
it'll take a .pdf from any source and has a number of options for 
imposing them.

Alternately this can be done using the ``texexec'' front-end for 
ConTeXt.

cambridge has a new ctan machine; it's now been up and working on the
addresses cam.ctan.org, ftp.tex.ac.uk (ftp protocol) and rsync.tex.ac.uk
(rsync protocol) for well over 24 hours.  even the most dilatory name
server should get you to the new machine, now.

this is the third machine that has served ctan since it came to
cambridge, and it's not come a moment too soon -- the old machine was
providing rather poor performance.

the machine is a dual 2.6ghz xeon with 2gbyte of memory and lots of
disc.  we believe it will support applications at an acceptable level for
some time.

the machine was purchased with a grant from the uk tex users' group, and
the ctan team is also grateful to the university of cambridge computer
laboratory for continuing to provide a friendly home to ctan.

the observant will have noticed that i did not mention www.tex.ac.uk,
above.  that is still being hosted by the laboratory's main web server.
there are (ahem) structural difficulties with moving the web service,
and we decided to go live with what we could, as soon as i could make at
least something work reliably,

amssymb is the name, not amssymbol.

I'm trying to test out my Zapfino font setup outside of the DOS penalty 
box it's running in (when I got started with it, I was using 
miktex1.20e).

After installing TeXLive 2003 demo as included w/ TLC2 the ovp files 
have errors like:

[Maxwell:~] wadams% ovp2ovf 
/Volumes/KINGSTON/localtexmf/fonts/ovp/zapfino.ovp
line 2 (warning): OFMLEVEL value must be D 0 or D 1
line 2957 (internal): compute_ofm_character_info

or

/Volumes/KINGSTON/localtexmf/fonts/ovp/zapfino-expert.ovp
line 2 (warning): OFMLEVEL value must be D 0 or D 1
line 3649 (internal): compute_ofm_character_info

Would it be possible to put an old version of the Omega font utils in 
with the new ones?

Any idea why this is happenig or how else to fix it?

Subject: [texhax] including random files
Message-ID: <40B346CA.2020004@unicatt.it>

Hi all,
I'd like to include in a LaTeX document some random files (for exams) 
and I'm asking if there is a package doing this or if it is possible to 
write some macros.

I need something doing this:

	Blah, blah
\input{random file 1 in random directory A}  (or random file 'a' where 
'a' is in a given range)

blah blah

\input{random file 2 in random directory B} (or random file 'b' where 
'b' is in a given range)

I'm trying some very dumb method like:
a) to generate a random number using random.sty or lcg or fp (say 
"random number"=\foo)
b) to do "\input{\foo}"

but this (obviously) does not work for some protection problem.

Can someone give me some help

Message-ID: <200405252347.i4PNlWc12393@f7.net>

Dear TeX user,

The latest installment of the TUG newsletter:

1) The early bird discount for 2004 TUG memberships expires May 31.
If you'd like to renew or join, please see http://tug.org/join.html.

New or renewing 2004 members can now choose to get TeX Live 2003 instead
of (the not-yet-released) TeX Live 2004, or both for an extra $15.
Thanks to several comp.text.tex posters for suggesting this.


2) Through a new affiliation with the Pearson publishing group, which
includes Addison-Wesley, we can now happily offer a 30% discount and
free (within the USA) shipping on any Pearson book (their other imprints
include Prentice-Hall, New Riders, and many others).  Also, TUG receives
a commission on each book sold.  
  http://tug.org/books/
We'd like to thank Pearson for giving us this opportunity.


3) The Practical TeX conference will take place in San Francisco, July
19-22.  A tentative schedule, list of participants, online registration,
and other information are all available through the web:
  http://tug.org/practicaltex2004/

The group rate on hotel rooms is only available through June 18; after
that, rooms are on a "space available" basis and the rate will probably
be double or more.  So sign up early if you're coming!


4) TUG 2004 will take place in Xanthi, Greece, August 30-September 3.
Its registration and list of accepted papers are likewise available online:
  http://tug.org/tug2004/


5) Preprints for the 2004 annual meeting have been sent to the printer
and should arrive in all 2004 members' mailboxes within a few weeks, as
a special publication from TUG.  There will be two regular issues of
TUGboat for 2004 to follow in due course.

The final proceedings will be printed as a volume in Springer-Verlag's
prestigious series Lecture Notes in Computer Science, and available
at the conference or through Springer.

The details and reasoning for this unusual arrangement are spelled out
at http://tug.org/TUGboat/Pres/pres-tb79.html.

Production of the three issues of TUGboat for the 2003 membership
year is continuing.  The proceedings of the TUG 2003 conference will
probably be the first to be completed.


6) We are happy to announce a grant by the TeX Development Fund to
Boguslaw Jackowski and Janusz Nowacki, for continuing development of the
Latin Modern fonts (the first release was included in TeX Live 2003).
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/lm/

We welcome applications for development of any aspect of the TeX system.

As always, please don't hesitate to contact us for any reason.

Message-ID: <s0b46a0c.042@MAIL.NDRI.ORG>

Hello

Please excuse me if this is covered in the FAQ; I did try to look, but
am not even sure what to search for.  Also, this is only my third day
using LaTeX

I am using texlive and WinEdt on a Windows machine

When I try to typeset the following

\documentclass[12pt, draft]{report}
\usepackage{graphicx, amsmath, amssymb, latexsym}

\theoremstyle{plain}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}


\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{defintion}{Definition}


\begin{document}


BUNCH OF STUFF

\end{document}

I get an error message that there is an undefined control sequence
regarding \theoremstyle

By reading the help provided in the log, and looking at Math into LaTeX
and Guide to LaTex, it seems to me that this is either due to
misspelling or not having the right package.  But I've checked the
spelling 5 times, and I thought I had loaded the right packages.

When I change report  to amsbook  I get DIFFERENT error messages, about
too many closing }.....but I've checked multiple times, and they seem to
be in pairs.  

Any help appreciated

Thanks

I don't know that you can bunch up the package names in a single 
command like this.

Try doing one \usepackage per package.

D'oh!  Forgive my early-morning, bleary-eyed, misdirection.

Try the package 'amsthm'.

It's allowed, that's not it.

\theoremstyle{plain} is a command in the theorem package, so you have to add a 
\usepackage{theorem} to your document, or replace
 \usepackage{graphicx, amsmath, amssymb, latexsym}
with
 \usepackage{graphicx, amsmath, amssymb, latexsym, theorem}

Dear TUG,

When I typeset an article using a modified version of an article style,

I am sure i have defined both \@oddhead and \@evenhead properly in 
\ps@headings. But still the output is always taken from \@oddhead.

Please suggest how to rectify this.

Have you provided:

  \pagestyle{headings}

in the preamble so that \ps@headings take effect. If you have given,
then the possible problem is that "twoside" option is not invoked.
You might load your class as:

 \documentclass[twoside]{article}

...................

It has become a serious problem!
After those messages of error I completely uninstalled all the tetex 
packages the tex connected ones (lyx, texmacs, etc.) by means of 
"apt-get remove --purge pasckage"; then - to be on the safe side - I 
removed by hand the
/etc/texmf & /usr/share/texmf directories with their subdirs.

Reinstalling all over again tetex-2.0.2 from the official debian testing
archive via apt-get install tetex-bin again causes a problem: when 
setting the package up debian testing complains about  a missing 
configuration file under /etc/texmf (as I said this dir was removed by 
hand by me!). In fact, I found that the configuration program of 
tetex-bin 2.0.2-14  expected an /etc/texmf/texmf/05TeXMF.cnf file that 
actually was codified with something like /usr/share/texmf/..../05TeXMF.cnf.
I copied the required file under/etc/texmf/texmf/ and the configuration
complained about a missing /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf file. 
I found it under the "usual"  /usr/share/texmf/.... and copied in the right 
position and now the error is as follow:

Regenerating /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf ... done
update-fmtutil; Something seems wrong.
dpkg: error processing tetex-bin (--configure):
  subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1
Errors were encountered while processing:
  tetex-bin
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

Has anyone any idea on why this has been happening?

What to do next?

An extreme solution would be to get rid of every tex related package (via
apt-get emove --purge), eliminate the directories involved, and starting a
new installation all over again FROM SCRATCH.
In this case what are all the directories I should delete?

Ciao in a despair

I have been dissaitisfied with the Debian teTeX too long.  The
developers keep old versions of the TeX packages with bugs that have
already been fixed on CTAN.  There are also many interesting packages
missing (do you have ucs for example?)  So I switched to TeXlive.  You
can download the entire DVD image from tug.org, or become a TUG member
and receive the CDs + DVD + TUG Boat every year by mail.  It is
frustrating to deal with problems that have long ago been fixed, just
because the developers package out of date software (in your case, not
even properly).  So my suggestion is to dump the Debian TeTeX or file a
bug report against it and wait.

BTW, on my machine the 2003 TeXlive's `latex --version` says
"e-TeX (Web2C 7.5.2) 3.141592-2.1" while Debian unstable's says
"TeX (Web2C 7.4.5) 3.14159".  Notice the difference?

Good luck,

Hi, I have downloaded TeXnicCenter and would like to use it to input my file and to compile.

However, when I try to do this, I get the following message: Cannot execute the command. Error: The directory name is invalid.

Can you please indicate what might be the problem

Thank you for your kind assistance.
