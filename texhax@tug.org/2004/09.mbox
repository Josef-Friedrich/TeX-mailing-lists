Dear Robin, dear Karl,

Many thanks to both of you for the pointers and the background
information!

The news on Omega and eOmega don't seem all that reassuring...

I've now read the preprints of TUG 2004 (the one's of TUG2003 I can't
access, unfortunately), Vincent Zoonekynd's excellent pages without
which I would have been totally lost in the wilderness and the
relevant parts of "Digital Typography using Latex" which I obtained
this weekend. With this background I've now successfully tyeset a
small sample text of mine in Omega 1.23.2.1, the version included in
my Debian tetex distribution. The text contains an assortion of
German, Greek, Hebrew and Russian passages. I use a Unicode true-type
font to render the Hebrew.  However, many things remain obscure, for
example why Lambda typesets a footnote in an overall left-to-right
text (German, in this case), but anchored in Hebrew paragraph
right-to-left rather than left-to-right as the main body of the
text. I wonder if it is worth the time to delve into these
'behaviours' without any substantive documentation nor any point of
contact to ask if these are errors (possibly long corrected in the
source) or intended features.

Great. 

Do you know of any experience of e-tex + UTF-8 encoded text (heavily
multilingual, multiscript)?

I had a look at NTS. I like the idea of the Java reimplementation, and
to my surprise I've been able to run some old plain TeX files of mine
without noticing any change to the resulting dvi (and it took only
some twenty times longer than the real TeX). 

That still leaves the question in the air where the journey is
heading...


Best regards,

Marc

Actually, I meant it my way round ;-)

As a member of TUG for 2004 and thus got the paper version of the
preprints. With the 2003 papers at

http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents24-1.html 

I had no luck the other day. Today, I can access the articles (might
some prermissions on the server have been changed?)

  There is also  XeTeX  for Mac OS X; see

    http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/xetex
    http://scripts.sil.org/xetex

This is  etex + support for any font that can be displayed on a Mac.

Fonts are becoming more complicated programs, with greater capabilities.
Wherever Apple takes their font technology, XeTeX will follow.
Traditional TeX typography is also handled, but general (PDF or PS)
  \special  syntax is not handled yet.


Hope this helps,

Depends on your TeX implementation --- I believe TrueTeX, and maybe 
Bakoma have some sort of support for such as OLE objects.

Word documents can be directly converted by saving as .rtf and using 
the converter rtf2latex

There're a couple of macros and other tools for converting from Excel 
documents to LaTeX tables.

Again, depends on your implementation and what sort of output one is 
generating.

Typically if one uses a typical TeXLive setup, dvips and Ghostscript 
will allow one to place a .eps and work with it fairly naturally, even 
if one doesn't have a PostScript printer. You can make a .eps from any 
Windows application which will print by printing to a PostScript 
printer attached to FILE: and setting the job type to be .eps

Alternately, use pdftex to generate .pdf directly and make .pdfs to 
place. You may find a utility like Frank Siegert's pStill (shareware 
from http://www.pstill.com ) useful for this to generate a .pdf from 
Windows applications which don't do so directly.

Dear sir/madam,

I'm working on my paper to graduate from University. I have a question about 
importing .eps files in LaTeX. I hope I sent this question to the right 
adress. If this is not the case, I'm sorry.

I have some figures I want to import in my LaTeX file. I already included 
the package "graphics". I'm trying to import some figures using the 
commands:
\begin{figure}[p]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{figuur1-uit-mayura.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
These commands are placed in the middle of my paper. I want the file to 
appear in this place. But that doesn't happen, it appears at the end of my 
paper. I've tried almost everything: scaling it, setting the box size, etc. 
I've got six pictures I want to put in my paper, but they all appear at the 
end of my paper. Can you please help me?

Thank you very much,

Hi,

Try removing the \begin{figure} and \end{figure} lines and putting the
\includegraphics{figure.eps} line wherever you want the figure to appear.

Try to force the placement of the float "right here":

  \begin{figure}[!h]

If the float doesn't fit at the current posititon in the text, you may try
\clearpage to flush all floats in the queue.

Is LaTeX complaining about "too many floats"?

Use a different placement:
p = put all floats (figures, tables, etc.) on a special page, that's what you 
ordered,  that's what you get
h = here (this is what you want)
b = bottom of page
t = top of page

So you should do
\begin{figure}[h]

    \begin{figure}[p]

By using "p", you are exactly telling LaTeX to put all the floats on a
page at the end.

If the suggestions already made by others do not suffice, you could also
use the float.sty package and the H (not h) position character.

The FAQ, not surprisingly, has more info on all this.

According to the Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List (which you can find on
at http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/ ), there
is:

\oiint in the wasysym package
\oiint in the mathabx package
\oiint in the txfonts / pxfonts package, together with \oiintclockwise
and a whole host of variants.

so

\usepackage{wasysym}
...

\oiint  dx dy

should work. If you don't like these, here's a kludge I've used for
years (but it doesn't scale in size with it's argument quite the way the
above are advertised to do)

\def\ess{\textsl S}
\def\dintcl{\int\limits_{\ess}\kern-0.7em\int\kern-1.4em\bigcirc\kern.7em}

Happy integrating...

Message-ID: <MBBBJFILCHONLINKEBBKMEICCDAA.romeomedina@libero.it>

I'm trying to install ChiTeX, after downloading the files from

ftp://ftp.math.ncu.edu.tw/chitex/unix/6.1.2p12lc/

. It appears to be one of the most difficult installations ever happened me
to do.
At a certain point during the installation I was asked questions
with symbols I didn't understand:

????????????????????:
         1.  texmf ?????? (?????? /usr/.../texmf) ??:
               2
         2.  *.fmt ???????????? (?????? /usr/.../texmf/web2c) ??:
               2
         3.  .../texfonts ?????? (?????? /var/tmp/texfonts ??
           /var/lib/texmf ?? /var/texfonts ?????????????? tfm, pk ??) ??:
               /var/lib/texmf
            ??????????, ?????????? run 'texmfconfig' ??????????????
         4.  ???????? latex ????????????:
               /usr/bin

         ??????????????????????????????????.

         ?????????????? y ??, ?????????? '1' ?? '2',..
         (????????????????????????????)
         :

I didn't know what to reply!
Then I wrote to professor Hung-Yih Chen, who said:

    Your system should have been installed with chinese environment
    or have chinese xterm, for example, cxterm or others.
    In cxterm, you could read and input chinese.
    The symbols you could not read are chinese characters.

Then I went to the web site

http://cxterm.sourceforge.net

and downloaded the 5.2.3 version of cxterm.
I tried to install it:
I typed

   tar xvfz cxterm-5.2.3.tgz
   cd cxterm-5.2.3
   ./configure

and everything seemed to go well; but when I typed

   make

I got the following output ('carolina' is the username;
she's my sister, who speaks Chinese,
and it's for her that I'm trying to install ChiTeX):

[carolina@localhost cxterm-5.2.3]$ make
make  all-recursive

make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/carolina/cxterm-5.2.3'
make: *** [all] Error 2
[carolina@localhost cxterm-5.2.3]$

So the installation did not succeed.
I would like to ask prof. Hung-Yih Chen only questions strictly concerning
ChiTeX.
Is anybody out there who can give me a hint?
(Maybe Edward G.J. Lee?)
I'd be very grateful.

Thanks indeed,
		Rodolfo

P.S.: Is it necessary to know Chinese to do the installation of cxterm and
ChiTeX?
I know nothing of Chinese, and my sister is out these days.
And, after I will have installed cxterm and ChiTeX, I still haven't
understood
how to type the standard input and the input .tex file in order to get
Chinese symbols.
I don't understand how the symbols I mentioned above: ????????????????????:
etc...
can be called chinese characters, neither how they can be produced on the
keyboard.
Maybe a special keyboard is needed?
I realise there's plenty of things I still don't know about all this

The most important line in the above output is this one:

> /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lncurses

This means that you are missing some essential library files to build the
application. In this particular case, you will need to have the development
headers of ncurses installed.

If you're on a linux distribution, it will probably feature a package called
ncurses-dev or libncurses-devel or something like that. On my Debian
GNU/Linux  system, the exact name is `libncurses5-dev'.

If your system does not feature a package containing header files for
ncurses, you will need to download and install them manually. A quick google
search for ncurses will point you to the right location.

I hope this information is of some help to you.

    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lncurses

In addition to hunting down ncurses as suggested
(http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html), it might also "just work"
to link against -lcurses instead.  Maybe.

    P.S.: Is it necessary to know Chinese to do the installation of
    cxterm and ChiTeX?

Well, you might able to complete the installation, but I doubt you'll be
able to get much further.

    I don't understand how the symbols I mentioned above: ÒÑ²âµ½»òÄãÊäÈëµÄÄ¿Â¼:

You're probably seeing them in a Latin font.  They need to be displayed
in a Chinese font, and interpreted with Chinese conventions -- typically
UTF-8 or some sort of multibyte encoding (there are several)

    Maybe a special keyboard is needed?

Desirable, at least, I would think.  But I've never typed Chinese.

Hopefully there is some documentation with chitex, or hanging around on
the web, which explains some of these basic things about getting
started.

Good luck,
karl

Sorry, but this is wrong.  The only correct answer came from Karl:
*Read the FAQ!*

The [h] does not force LaTeX to put it "here".  It just allows to put
it here, given that there is enough space for it.

If there is not enough space "here", then it really floats.  It cannot
be put anywhere else.  Fortunately, the LaTeX standard document
classes issue a \clearpage at the end of the section or chapter which
flushes all unprocessed floats.

If you want it exactly here, and nowhere else, then you have to use
float.sty.  If you want it placed as near to "here" as possible, you
should allow b and t as well.

The order doesn't matter, BTW., [htb] and [bth] are identical.  This
is often misunderstood.

After trying [h], if that doesn't work, another possibility
(which I use all the time) might be to make the figure smaller,
e.g., using \scalebox{}, for instance, if I don't want to
use \clearpage, etc., at this point.

  Yes, it's not easy to install ChiTeX. And ChiTeX is for domestic
  people using, so it will present Chinese characters.

  This term is obsoleted in new Linux system. You can't compile it
  without modified the code. What Prof. Chen mean is you have to
  have a Chinese environment in your system to display Chinese
  messages.

  You can install rxvt-CJK/rxvt from your CD or rpm sites instead.
  And you will need Chinese font too.

  You need libncurses5-devel package.

  I install it on my Mandrake-10, but fail. Seems the ChiTeX
  package need modify the code to fit the new gcc/glibc. It
  will fail when compile the tools that need awka library.

  Could you tell us why you need Chinese Plain TeX? Maybe LaTeX
  CJK will be suitable for you? Or you just need some Chinese
  characters in your article only?

  If you don't know Chinese, how can you use the Chinese TeX
  system? I mean how you write your Chinese article?

  I will try to find out the problem of ChiTeX, but I'm not
  sure I can fix it.

Thanks indeed. By typing:

#urpmi libncurses-devel

cxterm could be installed.

On my pc I have Mandrake Linux 9.1,
and now I can read and input Chinese on my terminal,
so the installation of cxterm seems to have been succesful.
Maybe you mean that there is some other problem with cxterm
that I don't see yet now?

My next problem now seems to be
that during the installation of ChiTeX
the user is asked in Chinese language to choose between different options,
and I don't know Chinese.
In particular, at a certain point you get a sort of a list of 4 different
options:

????????????????????:
         1.  texmf ?????? (?????? /usr/.../texmf) ??:
               2
         2.  *.fmt ???????????? (?????? /usr/.../texmf/web2c) ??:
               2
         3.  .../texfonts ?????? (?????? /var/tmp/texfonts ??
           /var/lib/texmf ?? /var/texfonts ?????????????? tfm, pk ??) ??:
               /var/lib/texmf
            ??????????, ?????????? run 'texmfconfig' ??????????????
         4.  ???????? latex ????????????:
               /usr/bin

         ??????????????????????????????????.

         ?????????????? y ??, ?????????? '1' ?? '2',..
         (????????????????????????????)
         :

. Now after the installationall of cxterm
all this stuff is displayed with chinese character on the terminal,
but for me it's ununderstandble just the same.
I would need the English meaning of this output
and of the other Chinese inputs that should occur
further on during the installation of ChiTeX.

Actually, the installation of ChiTeX seems to partly done.
In fact, when I type

$chitex

I get the followiong output:

Usage: chitex [option [option]] sourcefile

  where sourcefile is a TeX/LaTeX source file, option are:
  -pdftex  compile with pdftex/pdflatex

; besides, when I try to compile one of the sample files
featured in the ChiTeX package, I get the followiong output:

. This partial installation is due to the fact
that the first time I got the lines above,
the ones with the 4 options,
I typed at random some keys from the keyboard,
and the installation went on in some way.
Did I maybe this way create another problem?
Or maybe I am a little step before the goal?

I use plain TeX to write mathematical notes and any other document,
in normal european characters. ChiTeX would be instead for my sister,
who is a Chinese-speaking tour guide
and often needs writing documents in Chinese language for her job.
I'm sure there must exist other easier chinese writing systems under MS
Windows,
but since I'm used by now to the high quality of TeX
I meant to achieve also this purpose with TeX beauty and power.
LaTeX would not be suitable for me because I'm not good at using it
and couldn't help my sister with the different matters and difficulties
that should arise writing documents.
Now my sister is leaving off and can't help me with the chinese characters
occurring in the installation of ChiTeX,
but yesterday when she read the output above
she found it too techincal and hard for her to understand.

Thanks indeed for your attention and your help,
								Rodolfo Medina

P.S.: If I understand well, after the installation of ChiTeX
you also have to configure Emacs
in order to make it able to type chinese characters?

Subject: [texhax] Write verbatim to file - can't stop
Message-ID: <BD5CA05D.208F%leingang@math.harvard.edu>

Hello,

I have a long LaTeX file with several control sequences of the form

\cs{text}

I'd like to change the definition of \cs to write "text" to another file,
unexpanded.

The TeXbook shows on p. 422 how \answer ... \par can write solutions to an
answer file, but that's not the syntax that I have to start with.

I found the answers package on CTAN, which includes an environment
"Filesave", so that

\begin{Filesave}{stuff}
When in the course of human events it becomes necessary...
\end{Filesave}

writes the text to stuff.tex.  But

\renewcommand{\cs}[1]{\begin{Filesave}{stuff}#1\end{Filesave}}

doesn't work, I think because Filesave uses some of the verbatim macros to
disable (make letters) characters like \.  So the \end{Filesave} macro isn't
a macro anymore.  The result is that the whole rest of the file gets slurped
into stuff.tex, and the error is

Runaway argument?
! File ended while scanning use of \next.

If I could figure out what characters have the right catcodes so that
\end{Filesave} gets expanded again, that might work.  Or maybe there's
another existing solution.

Any advice?

TIA,
Matthew Leingang

Try the following, this seems to work as you wanted.

\documentclass{article}

\newwrite\x

  ChiTeX cannot find the font(MOEKAI). But MOEKAI is for Traditional
  Chinese, I'm afraid you maybe install the Traditional(Big5) fonts
  and compile the Simplified(GB2312) Chinese tex file. There are two
  different font.

  ChiTeX has documents in the doc directory, and written on English
  with some Chinese, maybe you can try to read it first.

  ChiTeX has Windows version and newer than Un*x version.

Many thanks indeed to Edward and Haruhiko for their kindness.
But now I think I'll go on with the installation of ChiTeX.
Afterwards, in case, I'll have a look at plain Omega, which I don't know at
all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The directory that has been detected or you have inputed:
           1. The 'texmf' directory (generally is /usr/.../texmf) is:
                2
           2. The '*.fmt' files are in the directory (generally is
            /usr/.../texmf/web2c):
                2
           3. .../texfonts directory (generally is /var/tmp/texfonts
           *or* /var/lib/texmf *or* /var/texfonts containing
            subdirectory  tfm, pk etc.) is;
                /var/lib/texmf
             If no such directory, you maybe need to run
              'texmfconfig' to creat this directory.
           4. The executable file 'latex' is in the directory:
                /usr/bin

           Above directorys MUST *not* empty!

           If you make sure all are right, type 'y', otherwise
           type '1' *or* '2' ...
           (in order to correct the wrong directory)
           :
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my opinion, the '1' and '2' items maybe wrong, because no
directory names '2'. So perhaps your ChiTeX installation is corrupt.

I'm a Emacs user. Emacs support chinese characters.
  First of all,
  you need at least one chinese font files in your system and
  configure Emacs to recognize it. You should read the Emacs manual's
  *mule* section for more information. You can type:
  
      M-x view-hello-file
      
  to see if your Emacs can display chinese characters correctly. If
  you are very lucky, you will seen this line:

              Chinese (?????,??)	??

         Secondly, you need a chinese input method to input chinese. You
  can use X input method(XIM) to do this. The SCIM input method is an
  excellent input method platform, you can download it form:
  
     http://freedesktop.org/~suzhe/
     
  Fortunately, You have another more convenient choice. Emacs itself
  has various of language input methods including chinese. You can
  try:

      C-u M-x toggle-input-method RET TAB

  to see is there any chinese input method? If you use Emacs 21.3 or
  other older version, maybe you have to install leim package. It
  can be found in:

      http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/

  The leim package has been included in CVS Emacs now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  At last, although you have your own reason to use plain TeX to
  typeseting chinese. I strongly recommend you to use LaTeX whith CJK
  macro package. It is easy to use and more sophisticated than
  ChiTeX. As far as I known, all the chinese TeX(LaTeX) users are use
  CJK or CCT to typesetting their papers.

  If you have any question, please mail to me, I will do my best to
  help you.

????(Best Regards)!

  Ho, ho, there are many people use cwTeX and ConTeXt too. :)

  ChiTeX is a Chinese TeX system itself, but CJK package is an
  environment. There are two different purpose I think.

When I've written my bibliography in a .bib-file, and compile the

sadly, "joined up thinking" doesn't work between babel and bibtex :-(
(internationalisation remains the biggest unsolved issue in tex, imo.)

the custom-bib system has a means of translating its stuff, but (a) i
don't know how it works, and (b) it doesn't seem to do swedish (says
he, guessing what your chosen language might be).

there's a set of translations of the latex standard styles in the
swebib package (in the miktex package system under that name -- just
ask for it).  that gives you swe(abbrv|alpha|plain).bst -- would that
do   

> Disclaimer: Yes, I checked the FAQ.

sorry.  added to the ever-growing list of answers i need to write.

swebib _is_ in the ctan catalogue, so you might just have found it
that way.

    Is there a way to get such words localized?

Harald Harders has written a package called babelbib.
http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/babelbib/
(the distribution there also includes his TUGboat article on this.)

Jean-Michel Hufflen has written a program named mlbibtex which allows
for multilingual support.  I'm not sure if it's really ready for
production use, though, or where the best place is to download it.
Jean-Michel's email is on his web page
http://lifc.univ-fcomte.fr/~hufflen/.

Oren (Patashnik, bibtex author) has promised to address this, one way or
another, in the vaunted bibtex 1.0.  Not that that helps you now.

Robin's answer is probably the most practical immediate solution, though.
(Robin, perhaps above is more fodder for the future FAQ entry.)

Hope this helps,
karl

  It's OK, never mind. :)

  Yes. I inform Prof. Chen. I think he will update the Un*x
  version soon when he has time.

  cwTeX support Simplified Chinese too. AFAIK, ConTeXt support
  Simplified Chinese very well by the effort of Hong Feng and
  Lei Wang.

  I hope CCT can support Traditional Chinese someday. It looks
  very nice.

I asked Tang to continue our posting privately to not annoy other listers
with the details of the messages occurring during the installation of
ChiTeX:
Tang generously translated in English the main messages
that prompt the user during that installation,
and made that installation almost completely understandble for the western
user.
I will give a report of that later.

Now I'm reporting our last messages of general interest.

Now I'm doing other trials.

When Emacs loads a file containig chinese characters,
e.g. the file 'math1gb.tex' featured in ChiTeX distribution,
those characters are not displayed, and I get something like:

????????????

. This happens even if I have switched to chinese input method.
How can the problem be worked out?

Maybe I'm wrong, but I suppose that you can't change the encoding
after the file has been loaded.

The only way to tell emacs which encoding should be used is to do that
at the beginning of the file.

For Vietnamese, for instance, I prepare a file like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------
% -*- mode: LaTeX; coding: viscii -*-



% Local Variables:
% eval: (set-language-environment "Vietnamese")
% eval: (set-input-method "vietnamese-viqr")
% eval: (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'viscii)
% End:
--------------------------------------------------------------

Then I save this file to disk and load it again.  The comments are
evaluated when the file is loaded.

Then I can type Vietnamese text quite conveniently and it is displayed
properly. 

Of course, you must have installed the east asian fonts.  You can
verify this by typing 

       M-x view-hello-file

in emacs.

M-x means that you should press the x while having the Meta key
(usually Alt on Linux systems) pressed.

Note that the "% Local Variables:" section is at the end of the file.

Maybe all this is much too inconvenient but it works for me.  You
could ask at the newsgroup gnu.emacs.help whether there is a more
convenient way.

Regards,
  Reinhard

^^^^^^^^^^^^
 To my surprise, I can read these characters, It means "A simple
 mathematic file."

 Make sure your Emacs already has *mule* support!
  
 I wanna know, what exactly did you see in your emacs? Chaos code or
 some hollow squares? Can your Emacs can display chinese characters
 correctly in my email?

 If there are chaos code, you need to configure emacs coding system,
 otherwise, hollow squares indicate that the emacs can't find
 appropriate chinese fonts.

 Secondly, I want to know  what environment does your Emacs runing
 in? In the text console, terminal emulator or X window system?

 In text console and terminal emulator, Emacs can support chinese
 automaticly if the terminal itself support chinese. You should
 install *cce* to support chinese in text console, you can download
 it form:

    http://ftp.cdaan.com/sy/light/cce-0.50-11122003-dist.tgz

 Does your terminal emulator is cxterm? cxterm already support
 chinese well, so you can just try 'emacs -nw' in cxterm.

 If the X window system is your default working enviroment, let's
 make more effort! There are many ways to achieve our goal. I give
 you three *independent* methods:

     1. Does your system have chinese font files already? run:

         $xfontsel

        to find a font and remember its name. If you have no chinese
        font, download it from:
        
          http://ftp.cdaan.com/sy/light/chinese-font1.tar.gz
          
        Install the fonts(add font information to the 'fonts.dir'
        and 'fonts.scale' files).

        Now I suppose that you have a font names 'fangsong ti'.
        Edit your .emacs and add these lines:

          (create-fontset-from-fontset-spec
          "-isas-fangsong
ti-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-c-160-gb2312.1980-0" t)

          (set-language-environment "Chinese-GB")
          (set-selection-coding-system 'cn-gb-2312)
          (set-clipboard-coding-system 'cn-gb-2312)
          (set-keyboard-coding-system 'cn-gb-2312)
          (setq locale-coding-system 'cn-gb-2312)
          (set-terminal-coding-system  'chinese-iso-8bit)
          (setq default-input-method 'chinese-py-punct)
          
     2. You can use TrueType chinese fonts in emacs. Download it
        form:

          http://ftp.cdaan.com/sy/light/simsun.ttf
          http://ftp.cdaan.com/sy/light/mingliu.ttf

        Install these two fonts and run 'xfontsel' to check them as above.

        Edit .emacs file add these lines:

           (set-keyboard-coding-system 'cn-gb-2312)
           (set-selection-coding-system 'cn-gb-2312)
           (set-terminal-coding-system  'cn-gb-2312)
           (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'gb2312)
           (setq default-buffer-file-coding-system 'gb2312)
           (setq locale-coding-system 'gb2312)
           (set-language-environment-coding-systems "chinese-gb"  nil)
           (if window-system
               (if (not (member
'("-*-verdana-normal-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-chinese"
                       . "fontset-chinese") fontset-alias-alist))
                               (progn
                                 (create-fontset-from-fontset-spec
           "-*-courier new-normal-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-chinese,
           chinese-gb2312:-*-simsun-normal-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-gb2312*-*,
           chinese-big5-1:-*-mingliu-normal-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-big5*-*,
           chinese-big5-2:-*-mingliu-normal-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-big5*-*" t)

           (setq default-frame-alist
                (append
                 '((font . "fontset-chinese"))
                 default-frame-alist)))))

     3. You can visit:

         http://mule-gbk.sourceforge.net/

I'm not sure above settings can work perfectly in your system. Maybe
you have to read the Emacs manual or turn to Emacs mail list.

To test your chinese coding system, type:

        M-x describe-language-environment RET Chinese-GB

If the chinese characters are displayed correctly?

CVS Emacs has made many improvements in *mule* support, there is an
useful command in CVS Emacs:

        M-x revert-buffer-with-coding-system

Perhaps you need to try it.

Best Regards!
Tang

Hi, Tang:

great! Now I can correctly visualise chinese characters in files.
I followed the first procedure you suggested.
First I checked the presence of the font name 'fangsong ti' with the command

        $xfontsel

. Then I said

        emacs .emacs

and added the lines you suggested at number 1) of your message.
Then I closed Emacs, reopened it with the file math1gb.tex and...
voil\`a! The chinese characters finally appeared.
Besides, I can easily switch from chinese to english input method and vice
versa just tiping 'C-\'.
Fantastic!

Now I'm asking you two more things:
1) how is it possible to display chinese characters in emails, like you do,
and in the same format you use,
   which I find very nice
   (though I send and receive e-mail using Windows and not Linux,
    because I didn't manage to configure Internet connection with Linux);
2) how can I do a surprise to my sister and type in Chinese the message
        'Welcome back home, Carolina!'
   that I can show her next week?

Thanks again for your precious help,
                                		Rodolfo

   I use Gnus as my mail client. Since your Emacs handle chinese well now,
   then gnus also can display chinese. Please get the last release
   from Gnus homepage
   
       http://www.gnus.org
       
    The Gnus FAQ is a step by step turorial. you should read it
    carefully.

       http://my.gnus.org/FAQ/

   After you have finished Gnus installation, add this line in your
   .gnus.el file:

      (setq gnus-default-charset 'cn-gb-2312
          gnus-newsgroup-ignored-charsets '(unknown-8bit x-unknown
          iso-8859-1))

    in order to handle chinese characters.

   I use mule-gbk(http://mule-gbk.sourceforge.net) to deal with
   chinese, which is a bigger charset than cn-gb-2312. But I think
   gb2312 charset is enough for you.

   You can also install the *simsun.ttf*, which is a vector type
   font and have more pretty visual effect. Just change the font
   name 'Fangsong ti' to 'simsun'. 'Fangsong ti' is a
   bitmap font. so can't be zoomed in and out arbitrarily.

   You even can specify different fonts for ascii characters and
   chinese characters:

      Edit the .emacs:

      (create-fontset-from-fontset-spec
          "-*-courier new-normal-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-chinese,
          chinese-gb2312:-*-fangsong
ti-medium-r-*--16-*-*-*-*-*-gb2312.1980-0" t)

      (setq default-frame-alist
                (append
                 '((font . "fontset-chinese"))
                 default-frame-alist))

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     OR

     Edit you ~/.Xdefaults
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Emacs.Font: fontset-chinese
     Emacs.Fontset-0:-*-courier new-normal-r-*-*-14-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-chinese,\
          chinese-gb2312:-*-fangsong ti-medium-r-*--16-*-*-*-*-*-gb2312.1980-0
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------

     $xrdb ~/.Xdefaults

     restart Emacs.

     This setting let emacs handle ascii characters with 'courier
     new' and handle chinese characters with 'fangsong ti'.

     
> 2) how can I do a surprise to my sister and type in Chinese the message

    'j' 'i' 'a' '1'

Hallo everybody.

I want to create a single page document in landscape orientation.
Is it possible to do it, and how, with plain TeX format?
If understand well, both the rotating and the lscape package,
recommended by the UK TUG's faq,
are written for LaTeX format. Is it true?

Thanks,

correct, though lscape could (i expect) be used with plain, if you
also load the plain version of the latex graphics package.

however, this may not be the best way forward.  lscape's code does

  \clearpage % i.e., \vfill\eject
  <set page dimensions for landscape>
  <set up output routine to rotate \box255 by 90 degrees>

at the start, and

  \clearpage
  <restore output routine>
  <restore page dimensions>

these are strightforward enough ideas, but it would take me some time
to work them out since i don't program the plain output routine much
(if at all).  hope it helps, anyway.

Could you maybe indicate a ctan address for this plain version?

This is very clear, but we should need in plain TeX a command similar to the
LaTeX command
\rotatebox#1#2.
Any hint to build such a command?

i would copy it out of the relevant graphics package driver (e.g.,
dvips.def).  the macro naming convention is pretty straightforward in
those driver packages.

When you create the document with \pdfpagewidth > \pdfpageheight (and
\hsize > \vsize) in pdftex, acroread and xpdf will show it in Landscape
format and automatically rotate it for printing, so you don't need to
state the rotation in the PDF file.

Set \hsize and \vsize and the margins appropriately.

If you are using pdftex you have to set \paperheight and \paperwidth,
for tex/dvips you have to insert \special{landscape}.

Subject: [texhax] parbox placement
Message-ID: <s13ebfac.049@kov.uovs.ac.za>

Hi

I am using LaTeX and would like to place a parbox somewhere on a page
without affecting the spacing of the rest of the page.  

For instance, can one "record" the vertical position on a page, then do
the parbox and then return to the recorded vertical position?  I know I
can undo the vertical spacing of the parbox, but would like to have a
mechanism whereby I need not do this in an ad hoc way for every parbox. 
This is what \marginpar does, but I don't think I can use marginpar.

Thank you.

you can't do that (easily, anyway -- if you were using pdflatex you
might manage something in a second pass ... i think).

alternatively, you might used the textpos package; but that requires
you to know the absolute positions you require, before you start.

why would a mechanism have to be ad-hoc?  a macro that placed the
arguments of \parbox inside a box of zero size would seem to me
entirely reasonable.

> This is what \marginpar does, but I don't think I can use marginpar.

it's not what \marginpar does: \marginpar is a float mechanism, and
they _do_ affect other things on the page (other \marginpars -- they
won't overlap each other, so if more than one is called "on the same
line" the later one will be displaced).

it might be helpful to know what you actually want to achieve, rather
than your proposed way of achieving it.  can you explain that, simply?

*-------
What I want to achieve: 
I have teaching notes where I want to insert boxes of parenthetical comments/explanations, but I don't want to disturb the main body of text when I insert or delete such boxes. I can do it with a \parbox, but then I have to undo the vertical spacing of the \parbox so the main body of text carries on (This is what I meant by "ad hoc": I will have to do it separately for each \parbox)

What \marginpar does:  One can insert, edit or delete a \marginpar without disturbing the main body of text.  (I appreciate that \marginpar does more, my concern is with not having to fiddle with the main text once I insert or delete something)

We have the TexLive distribution., which appears not to have the source
code for the latex command.

We are in need of an enhancement to the LaTeX command-line so that it will
read a list of tex filenames from either STDIN or disk and, for each
filename in the list, create a DVI file without forking and execing each
time.    We have 80,000 tex files to process for a typical run to create
80,000 dvi files.   Alternately, we could give it the name of a directory
and expect latex to process all the tex files in the directory.

We have the C expertise to make such an enhancement.

Please advise.     Thanks.

I suggest looking at the "rubber" package, available at [1] or from your
favourite Linux distribution. Rubber is a collection of python [2] scripts for
LaTeX compiling, and among them is rubber-pipe, which reads a .tex file from
STDIN and returns a compiled file in either dvi, postscript of pdf format at
STDOUT. Using standard unix commandline utilities (xargs, cat, pipes, et. al.),
I think you can achieve what you want without the need to code extensions or
enhanced versions of the TeX-related applications using constructs like these:

  for file in filelist.txt; do rubber-pipe < $file > $file.ps; done

However, I don't think you can avoid the fork()/exec(), LaTeX is not a batch
processor I think.

You might give this a try the following at the command line:

echo '\\relax Hello, world! \\bye' | tex

Using cat to send a sequence of files into the pipe would do a similar thing.
All you have to do is sit back and \relax.

Cheers,
Michael

Thanks to all who replied.

I achieved my purpose the following way.
At the beginning of the file I said:

	\input graphicx

, where graphicx.tex is a file featured in the package graphics.tar.gz
available at the ctan address 'macros/plain/graphics'.
Then I said (I don't know if it's very well done, however it seems to work):

\def\landscapeoutput{\shipout\hbox{\rotatebox{90}{\pagebody}}
                 \advancepageno\ifnum\outputpenalty>-20000
\else\dosupereject \fi
                              }

, and then:

\vfill\eject
\hsize=15cm \vsize=15cm
\output={\landscapeoutput}

Bla bla bla.

\end

Hi,
Pardon me if i am wrong, can't we use the following to achieve the same
thing from any Unix command line ?

$ for i in *.tex;do latex $i;done

As I understand it, for each file in the command above, there'll be an 
instance of loading a tex process into memory, processing a file, then 
unloading tex to repeat---it's this which the OP wants to avoid. It 
adds up to quite a bit of overhead for 80,000 iterations.

I think the development done on dvichop for instant preview in auctex 
(David Kastrup's project --- not 100% sure on the name) might be used 
for this.

I assumed the source files would be generated from a (database?)
application, that's why I suggested the pipe.

1.  Use latex instead of tex to process latex files.

2.  Do not send word documents to mailing lists.  Most people can't
    read them.

3.  Disable HTML when you post to mailing lists.  It's good for
    nothing.

On a UNIX system with a reasonably modern VM it should be more efficient 
than this.

When a tex (or any other) process exits, its pages in memory won't be 
"unloaded" but merely left alone. If memory becomes low in the future, 
the VM page scanner will discard those pages later (if they've been 
modified they will need to be paged out to storage first, of course)

When the next tex process starts up, the text and BSS pages it needs 
should be sitting there in memory for it to use, from the previous 
invocation.

Of course, there's more to fork/exec than just loading the code/data, 
but not too much more.

cheers,
calum.

	Ah, a Bourne family shell user.

	This runs into the problem that I believe the original user
	encountered:  latex *.tex failed for too many arguments
	(errno E2BIG  Arg list too long) and tracked the problem
	to the exec family library call.

	This only moves the problem to the ``for'' builtin.

	find . -name '*.tex' -print0 | xargs -0 latex
  or
	find . -name '*.tex' -print | while read file; do latex $file;done

	This will also descending to sub directories.

	In the `Linux' find, for the current directory:

	find . -name '*.tex' -maxdepth 1 ....

In my opinion this was entirely unnecessary.  As Reinhard Kotucha
pointed out, all you have to do is tell TeX the dimensions of the
paper (e.g., 297x210mm instead of 210x297mm) and leave the rotation and
other peculiarities of printing it out to the tools which were designed
for that task.  In particular, dvips allows you to say "-t landscape" to
rotate each page through 90 degrees (and will do this automatically if
you include \special{landscape} in the TeX source).

Your "instant preview" triggered something:
I have seen Jonathan Fine demonstrate an interactive (La)TeX & Emacs  
with just the extension required.  The TeX engine remains in memory  
& runs as a service (probably on a Linux box),  processing its input 
& spitting out chunks of dvi. There are papers Jonathan Fine  has 
written on it, possibly in TUGBOAT.   The source code may be 
available. He went to considerable trouble to allow a  source to be 
re-processed in fragments. Not necessary in the enquiry that started 
this thread. JF says the cost of loading TeX on an Intel box is large 
(orders of magnitude)  compared to the processing time for a TeX 
source that will likely generate about a page of text. So eliminating 
80K loads could be a useful saving

Hi-
I frequently have to use older Macs or PCs that don't have tex/latex

web service or project that will take .tex files and convert them to
postscript or pdf?
I'm talking about a text input field or file upload that would run tex

Yes, I was at the TeX meeting when he presented this excellent work. He
also provided emacs extensions that integrated with it to give WYSIWYG
editing. And he made the source available via his web site. The TUGBOAT
article is at
http://www.tug.org/tug2001/bulletin/preprints/JONATHAN_FINE_Instant_Previ.html
The code is on sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/users/jfine/

Redefining \= to something else does not survive inside \footnote's.

Example:

\documentclass{article}
\renewcommand{\=}{=}
\begin{document}
$A\=B$ % test
\footnote{$A\=B$}
\end{document}

This yields A=B in the main text, but an error in the footnote (text 
accent in math mode).

It's possible, it's even quite simple. However, the security issues are 
a major problem, since anyone can upload a TeX program and execute it on 
the server. This means that the entire TeX installation should be 
installed using techniques like chroot, which obviosly makes the project 
much more complicated.

I don't know of any such service, and I'm unsure that anyone really 
dares to implement it, considering the security.

what you should do depends on what you're already doing.

take a look at

i'ld chastise you for not looking there in the first place, only the
search that found it for me depended on me knowing the answer in the

(what's more, i've spotted editorial amendments that would make the
answer easier to read. :-( )

Subject: [texhax] Roman subscripts
Message-ID: <200409100937.i8A9bqb12707@tug.org>

Hi TeXnicians,

I often need to type subscripts in math mode that are roman instead of
italic. To avoid having to do a \mathrm every time, I defined

\catcode`\_=\active
\def_{\sb\mathrm}

so I can have roman subscripts with $X_{ff}$ and italic subscripts with
$X\sb{ff}$.

My question is: Since I have some experience in using TeX, but very little
experience in programming TeX, are there any disadvantages to this method?

Thanks,

Paul

\footnote issues a \@parboxrestore (deep down) which reverts \= to it's
original meaning (in the core). The reason you ask? The tabbing
environment.

So you'd have to also do a
\makeatletter
\let\@acciii\=
\makeatother
after redefining \= in your preamble.

It doesn't seem to work yet.  First I put your lines of code in my 
preamble, but LaTeX was complaining about ``missing \begin{document}''. 
  Then surrounded it by \AtBeginDocument (in my .sty file), but got

Subject: [texhax] Including PDFs in LaTex documents as figures
Message-ID: <72531CCA-0310-11D9-B3FE-000A957AFAEA@may.ie>

Hi,

I'm trying to include a (maximum) four-page document as a figure in a 
Latex document. I use the following to include the document (the 
example is only a three-page one):


% this is before the document section
\includepdfset{nup=2x2,landscape=false, frame = true,
                           offset=.25cm 0cm,deltax=.25cm,deltay=.5cm,
                           pagecommand={\thispagestyle{myheadings}} }

% this is in the document section
\includepdf[pages={1, 2, 3, {}}, scale=.7]{Paper}

I'm trying to refer to the four-page document as a figure, or at least 
have a caption with a label, but I can't seem to get
it to work! I could just make a single PDF from the 4-page document and 
then include that as an image, but I was wondering
if anyone knew how to do it a different way?

Thanks, John.

The point of my maneuver was to add some extra space around =, so I 
tried \renewcommand*\@aciii{\mathbin{\,=\,}} instead, but got ``missing 
$ inserted''.  Tried your version, same error.

I guess I should stick to my crappy hack, going wth

\let\footnoteclone\footnote
\renewcommand{\footnote}[1]{%
	\footnoteclone{\renewcommand\={\mathbin{\,=\,}}#1}}

so what you really want is

  \renewcommand*\@aciii{\ifmmode\expandafter\mathbin\fi{\,=\,}}

so you don't claim to be putting maths there if you're not in maths to
start with.

No, I am not using it outside math.

Here a sample file, that yields ``missing $ inserted'' when it 
encounters the math display with \=:

\documentclass{amsart}
\AtBeginDocument{%
	\makeatletter
	\renewcommand*\@aciii{\mathbin{\,=\,}}
	\renewcommand*\={\@aciii}
	\makeatother
}
\begin{document}
\[ A\= B \]
\end{document}

The funny thing is that just adding the @-code after \begin{document} 
yields the error ``\@aciii undefined''.

But works fine on my 600-page document.

OK, the following file

\documentclass{article}
\AtBeginDocument{%
\makeatletter
\renewcommand*\@aciii{\ifmmode\expandafter\mathbin\fi{\,=\,}}
\renewcommand*\={\@aciii}
\makeatother
}
\begin{document}
\[ A\= B \]
\end{document}

produces no error, but as output something like

ciii=
		AaaciiiB

if I surround \@aciii by braces, as in \renewcommand*{\@aciii} etc, it 
leads to the ``\@aciiiundefined'' error (no space in original).

Well that's because you are missing a "c". This works:

\documentclass{amsart}
\makeatletter
\renewcommand*\@acciii{\mathbin{\,=\,}}
\renewcommand*\={\@acciii}
\makeatother

\begin{document}
\[ A\= B \]
\end{document}

First problem: there should be two "c"s in "\@acciii".
Second problem: \makeatletter is ineffective if used within the argument
to another command.  Don't use \AtBeginDocument, or put the \makeatletter-
\makeatother pair outside the \AtBeginDocument instead of inside.

Message-ID: <3F0483B9-02C7-11D9-89DD-000A95B5F290@ucsc.edu>

Hi,
Just saw your old June msg re. Syriac.

I've been looking for a long time for a proper unicode Syriac keylayout 
for a Mac (I'm on
system os x.3, which I greatly appreciate for its language capacities)
and in desperation (nothing on the horizon yet) begun to make
one myself with Ukulele.  I'm just testing and debugging (i'm
no programmer).  It works so far in Mellel.
By the way, Mellel is as far as I can tell the best text editor if
you want to type Latin and Semitic scripts (as well as others).

But my keylayout for Mac doesn't work well yet with TeteX
(xelateX / xeteX see Jonathan Kew's page at SIL.org: great resource).
I'm able to set type beautifully in Hebrew, Arabic, Ethiop,
Greek, etc. beautifully, by using *any* fonts  on my mac.
With teXShop application, it's just great.

Syriac fonts are available free from Beth Mardutho / the Syriac
Institute.  Beautiful and varied.  I'm using them with either
Mellel or TeTeX.

If you're on PC, the keylayouts are probably no pb and easy to
get from Beth Mardutho.

Anyway, this may all be old news to you, just my two cents,

Folks:

I use a simple csh and perl script system to do 'instant preview':

http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/atchange.html

>From the page:

When the atchange program is running, it watches one or more files.
When any of those files changes, the atchange program will wake up and
do any actions you want. Tasks such as modifying and compiling a
program, modifying a data file and using it, or editing a text and
typesetting it can be automated with a single typed command such as:

atchange myprogram "compile myprogram"

Down the page is information about how to set this up for LaTeX:

LaTeX with Atchange: A Typesetting WYSIWYG!

Advantages:

1.  It will work on any unix system with perl installed.

2.  It is very simple.

3.  The code is a simple set of tools, so easily modified.

The method is to have an atchange watching the LaTeX source file
(.tex).  When one writes the file out (I programmed vi/vim to take a
',' to do this - one keystroke, no mousing!) the atchange
automatically runs LaTeX and BiBTeX, and pops up errors in a window. 
When done, it triggers the redisplay of the current page in xdvi using
xrefresh.  (So there is some mousing to switch pages in xdvi but
otherwise it is just one keystroke to get the new display.)

Notice that you can use atchange for a zillion other tasks - it gives
you 'on the fly automation'!

No, but there is the excellent soul package (strike out + underline) which

This sounds like the problem described in section 5.3 of the soul manual  
(v2.4).

I don't know exactly how package management works in PCTeX, but I would  
assume one can install the ec-fonts with whatever PCTeX offers.  
Alternatively follow the advice given in the soul manual.

Remember that you must use the lines
   \makeatletter
   \font\SOUL@tt=cmtt10
   \makeatother
for the advice in the manual to work. Melchior probably assumes you know @  
must be given special meaning for this to work.

    I currently use plain TeX. I'd like to use BibTeX for my dissertation. 

The file you want is btxmac.tex.  You can get it directly from CTNA:
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/btxmac.tex

The essential interface is the same as from LaTeX -- \cite, \nocite,
\bibliography, \bibliographystyle.  There are lots of comments at the
top of btxmac.tex about how to customize it if you have the need.

btxmac.tex, which is part of eplain, enables you to use bibtex from
plain tex.  there's a fair bit of eplain documentation, so look up the
eplain stuff in that.

which information extracted from
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=bibplain (the faq, on
the whole, being pretty patchy about plain tex information -- this is
just one place where it provides something useful).

What about adding floating-point arithmetic support to TeX?

Motivation:  I understand that the main obstacle to implementing truly 
powerful graphic routines directly via TeX is that TeX cannot handle 
floating-point arithmetics.  While various external tricks are 
wonderful, they seem a bit unstable (eg the beauty of PostScripting via

perhaps it could be considered for an extension to a

itself.  when tex was implemented on multiple platforms,
it was demonstrated that the floating-point arithmentic
was seriously not the same on all platforms, hence the

floating point is (more) uniform.  but that would need

a worthy goal, but it doesn't outweigh the original
motivation, which strongly affects the positioning of
letters in a line of type or symbols in a built-up
equation.

in any event, tex itself is frozen, so this is a
topic for a successor.

Subject: [texhax] Chapter numbering wrt Part
Message-ID: <20040916213447.GA4302@debian>

Hello everyone!
I'm writing a report, and I'm facing the following problem: with \part and \chapter, the chapter numbering doesn't get to 1 when a part ends.
Eg: Part 1 ; Chapter 1, Chapter 2 ; Then Part 2 ; Chapter *3*, Chapter *4*, instead of Chapter 1 & 2 within part 2.

Is there a numbering hierarchy command to issue in the preamble (setcounter
stuff), or is it
normal, and therefore I only need to use \part OR \chapter separately in a
report documentclass ?

Thanks for answering!


Stephane.

	learning system
Message-ID: <06ea01c49c35$46caebc0$7400a8c0@VAIO>

I have developed a new math learning system.  A brief description follows.  More info available at website http://funforms.com or I will send you the complete description by emailat your request. 


BENEFITS OF FUNFORMS: Funforms are basically binary in design (although a trinary system also exists).  The idea of place order is preserved, but coefficients are unnecessary except transiently during manipulation.  The meaning of the number is obvious to anyone with passing familiarity.  That is to say that the formulae are iconic or ideographic.  

Most importantly, as the user applies Funforms, mathematical operations become transparent, and understanding of the nature of the mathematical transaction becomes apparent to the user.  

Funforms operate mechanically, somewhat like an abacus or a slide rule.

We believe that Funforms can be taught to preschoolers as a game.  It may have advantages in teaching mathematical concepts to children and adults with learning disabilities for math.

Try the amsmath packages- one of their aligned math environments (probably
"align") should do what you want.

Message-ID: <002401c49dcc$2b5e3520$b904f080@ncl.ac.uk>

Dear All,
this is probably mostly aimed at Russian TeX users, but if anyone else has any suggestions I will be glad to listen.

The problem is that I am using PSCyr package to get vector cyrillic fonts and after I have installed it I am having troubles getting \AA properly. I have used PSCyr before on another computer (and it worked fine with the \AA), but the CD is gone now and I used miktex.org installer and then added PSCyr manually.

What I see is the circle coming first and then A as a result. I.e. something like oA (where o is a proper little circle at a reasonable height). The interesting thing is that \r{A} works the same way (oA), but \r{B}, \r{C} etc produce everything properly (the circle is above the letter). What is wrong? Has anyone seen this?

Without PSCyr everything is fine, but the fonts are raster...

I already suggested this, but here we go again:

\usepackage[reqno]{amsmath}

\begin{align*}
	A &= B  \tag{3pts}\\
	C &= D \tag{50pts}
\end{align*}

This will produce the output

		A = B			(3pts)
		C = D			(50pts)

I don't know how to get the dotted line.

One thing you might try is running LaTeX again - if the page numbers change
between one LaTeX run and the next due, say, to references and/or citations,
then you may need an extra run to get things right.

I'm trying to make koma-script  scrlttr2 class "speak" Italian.

parskip=half,%

..................................
\setkomavar{date}{Roma, \today}
.................................

with the only exception of the  ** date ** which is placed to the right
between the recipient address and the subject while, according to Italian
standards, it should be placed to the right well above the recipient's address
and just below  of the right top header.

How can I modify the position of the date in the koma-bundle?

Hi there,

my diploma thesis is the first thing I wanted to do in LaTeX. So far I
really like it and would like to hand in a LaTeX work. The problem: most of
my results are Graphs in Excel and as you can see in the attached pdf, they
don?t show even close to nice in LaTeX! :(

What am I doing wrong? - Or is it, that including a lot of excel-Graphs is
not what LaTeX is made for?

Do you have any idea, how I can include graphics like the attached ones
better than what I did?

I would really appreciate some help as I will have to hand in the thesis in
three weeks and am seriously considering dropping LaTeX for ordinary word
(what I did not like in the beginning)

Thanks a lot.

Sincerely,

Yvonne Boxberg

This has nothing to do with LaTeX.  It depends on the graphics file
format you export the excel files to.

Preferred file formats are PostScript and PDF.  Don't know whether
they are supported by M$, but maybe you can export to wmf (Windows
Meta File) and probably this is supported by ImageMagick, see

   http://www.imagemagick.org

for more information.

You would certainly get better output if you omit excel and use
gnuplot instead.  See:

   http://www.gnuplot.info/

  Reinhard

You don't say how you are including the graphs in your LaTeX file. Exporting 
the graphs from Excel to eps (encapsulated postscript) format, and then using 
the graphicx package (read grfguide.dvi) to include it in your file provides 
great flexibility.

Hope this helps,
Sebastian

That's probably because the output graphics files are of horrible quality.

In princple, there's absolutely no problem of this sort.

Hang on in there, it'll be well worth it!

Since M$ programmes almost never "export" kosher postscript files, your best
bet is probably to set up a printer that outputs pdf to a file (you can do
this following the fairly simle instructions provided by ghostscript (look
under redmon on their web page) and creating a redirected port.  The pdf
file created should then be of good quality and will import into LaTeX files
easily if (and only if) you are using pdflatex (as you presumably are).

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

P.S.  I'd be interested to know just how you were exporting your graphics.

I can affirm Philip's suggestion. I have written a step-by-step tutorial
how to set up GS and Redmon to produce PDF files. It can be found on
http://www.learn-line.nrw.de/angebote/qualitaetsentwicklung/download/g-pdfhandbuch.pdf
Unfortunately (for you? <g>) it has been written in German.

If you want to produce EPS files from your Excel graphics I would
recommend to install a postscript printer (e. g. ?Apple Color
LaserWriter? from your Windows CD or from Adobe and connect it to
?FILE?. In the printer settings (sorry for the German terms) choose
Druckeinstellungen... -> Layout -> Erweitert... -> Dokumentoptionen ->
Postscript-Optionen -> Postscript-Ausgabeoption and there the setting
?Eingekapselter Postscript (EPS)?. Then ?print? your graphic from Excel
to this printer ? you'll get an EPS file.

I produced lots of high-quality EPS graphics from Word or Excel for
subsequent use in LaTeX this way.

I am afraid that the PostScript specification defines the language as
drawing with opaque ink on top of a page (ink overwrites ink).  This
means that if the PS file has an area that is filled with white ink, it
will just be white unless you rewrite your PostScript interpreter, or
modify your input file.

Otherwise, see the attached bundle for an example of overlaying a
transparent encapsulated PostSrcipt on a page.

I'm interested in importing graphical diagrams as *.eps files in the
"normal" way, but inserting text into the diagrams (e.g. labeled arrows)
with LaTeX commands (so that I could easily change the labels without
having to edit the *.eps files).  I was thinking that the way it might be
done is to somehow create a graphic, with text boxes here and there as part
of it, that had an *.eps file as its background.  But I can't figure out
how to do this, or even where to look for instructions.  Am I on the right
track?  Is this possible?  Where can I go for help?

look at the overpic package -- ctan macros/latex/contrib/overpic/

it's not over-blessed with documentation, but there are a pair of
example files (opic-abs.tex and opic-rel.tex) which i used to teach
myself.  i then went through it with some collaborators, and they've
declared it "really neat", and have already used it in production (in
the volume they sent to press in august).

whatever, _i_ think it's a brilliant application of a simple idea :-)

Sounds exactly like what the "psfrag" package does.

There are two packages which you can use.  Robin and Ian already
mentioned them.  The difference between them is that the positioning
of the labels is done either in the eps file (psfrag) or in the latex
file (overpic) while the labels themselves are defined in the latex
file in both cases.

I recommend to read the documentation of both packages carefully
before you decide which way to go.

    > Where can I go for help?

Don't know which system you use, but maybe you'll find somwething
useful under .../texmf/doc/...

If you're in luck you have a program called texdoctk installed on your
system.

Thx, but my question referred to a PNG image, where the transparency 
coded into the image is simply ignored and replaced with white.

I guess you are using PDFLaTeX and the graphicx package does not
properly preserve transparency when converting PNG to PDF.  You can
either try to modify the graphicx package, or find an appropriate
external PNG->PDF/PS converter that does not replace transparent pixels
by pixels of a certain color.  Unfortunately, neither the netpbm
package, nor ImageMagick, nor GIMP seem to do what you need.

Good luck,

There's a third method which is very powerful -- more so than
either of the above two, but requires more to setup; though
you get back much more for the effort.

See:
       http://www-texdev.ics.mq.edu.au/WARM/

The above site gives lots of examples, as well as links to TUGboat
articles where the basis of the methods are described in some detail.

>
>> Where can I go for help?

As a quick comparison:

  overpic

    *  uses LaTeX's picture environment;
    *  you place other elements by specifying coordinates which you
       have to guess or use trial-and-error;
    *  the nice part is that coords can be given as fractions of the
       width/height of the imported image, so that the locations of
       your labels/annotations do not change if the image is scaled.


  psfrag

    *  relies upon clever PostScript tricks to place TeX typeset
       material at marked places within the .eps image.
    *  this requires preparing your .eps image specially with the
       labelling in mind -- not good for images from elsewhere.
    *  This method does *not* carry over to pdfTeX
       --- though you can still use it in conjunction with the
        ps4pdf  package.

    *  IMHO, while cute and powerful, this method is inherently
       unstable with respect to changes in how PostScript and PDF
       are supported by other software down the production chain.



  WaRMreader/Marked Objects

    *  uses extra (intuitive) logical markup of features contained
       within the image --- metadata for image content, so to speak.
    *  uses the Xy-pic package for graphics and diagrams in (La)TeX.
    *  by interpreting the extra metadata, the places to place labels
       can be located in a coordinate-free manner;
    *  the full power of Xy-pic is available for placing labels
       at/above/below/nearby/centered/etc. these locations.
    *  works with any image that you can use with TeX or LaTeX,
       **provided** you can construct the metadata. The .eps images
       (or other format) are **not** altered in any way.
    *  a plug-in tool for Adobe Illustrator is available to create
       the metadata --- freely available for Windows or Mac.
    *  Papers describe the (text-only) format, so that other tools
       can be used as well, to generate the metadata in a suitable way.


Xy-pic + WaRMreader is not everybody's cup of tea,
but it does give a powerful, reliable way to annotate graphics.

The metadata is stored external to the image, and can serve
as a searchable file that contains information about an images
contents, so could potentially be used for other applications.

Hi

I want to use parno.sty from http://sarovar.org/projects/parano/

I'm using tetex on a debian box, which has files all over the place.

Where should I put the .sty file?

I checked the latex faq, but I might have missed something :-/

TIA

have fun,

Your personal additions should go in your local texmf tree, not the main one. 
You can create your local texmf tree anywhere you want, but a standard place 
for it (including Debian) is /usr/local/share/texmf. You can organize your 
local tree as the main one, so duplicate it with, say:

cd /usr/share/texmf	# or wherever your $TEXMFMAIN is
find . -type d | cpio -pdv /usr/local/share/texmf

<*.sty> files can then go in /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/<package>


> I checked the latex faq, but I might have missed something :-/

This is question 113 of the english FAQ. You can also have a look at the 
recommended readings in section C (Documentation and Help) of that FAQ.

The graphics package does not convert anything.

pdftex does not convert PNG to PDF because PDF viewers understand
PNG.  pdftex just puts a wrapper around the graphic which contains
some information about the size and resolution.

I doubt that transparency in PNG files is supported at all in PDF.

But you can try:  If you insert a PNG file, which behaves as expected
in some web browser, into a TeX document and it does not appear
properly in Acroread 6, than it is quite likely that transparency is
not supported for PNG files.

I did not find anything about this in the PDF Reference Manual.

Transparency is supported for vector graphics.  I remember that Hans
Hagen demonstrated this at a TeX conference some time ago.  He didn't
use PNG (bitmaps).  The graphics had been produced by metapost.

Maybe it is better to ask questions like this on the pdftex mailing
list.  There are the experts.

  Reinhard

Not so very incidentally, one of the most important things you can do to
keep the distribution file tree clean (and to keep a lot of bad things from happening)
is to change fstab so that /usr is mounted read-only.  You have to put a link
to /usr/local in there first, but from then on, when risky packages try to alter
your /usr partition, you get a solid warning that they need to be altered before
installing.  Occasional things HAVE to be added to /usr. but very few.

/usr/local will have to be on a distinct partition, of course.
My /usr/local --> /opt/local (which indicates a long past experience with Solaris)

Copying the entire TEXMFMAIN to /usr/local seems extreme.  That is what
TEXMFCNF is for, and most particularly what SELFAUTOLOC, etc. is for.

The one lot of things you do have to copy out of /usr is the binaries
you actually use, which must be in /usr/local/bin (links won't work).

Remember that when you add something to /usr/local/texmf, you need to run
mktexlsr.  (It will complain that it can't do anyything about the ro /usr
but that is just what you want.

But the procedure I had suggested would only copy the directory tree without 
the leaves (i.e. the files themselves). That way, you can easily figure out 
where to put new files by referring to their equivalent place in $TEXMFMAIN.

I still think that the discipline of putting /usr and /usr/local on separate partitions
and making /usr read-only is a winner all around.  If you do it that way the modifications
to texmf.cnf are trivial
 E. g.:
      1,2c1
      < % HTG texmf.cnf -- runtime path configuration file for kpathsea.
      < % TO supercede /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf through use of $SELFAUTO
      ---
      > % original texmf.cnf -- runtime path configuration file for kpathsea.
      62c61
      < TEXMFLOCAL = /opt/local/texmf
      ---
      > TEXMFLOCAL = /usr/local/share/texmf
      89c88
      < VARTEXFONTS = /var/opt/texmf
      ---
      > VARTEXFONTS = /var/lib/texmf
      267,268d265
      < %%% I also use a link from /opt/local/texmf/fonts to /fonts, but that
      < %%% is only for programming convenience
      286,287c283
      < TEXCONFIG = .;$VARTEXFONTS/dvips//;$TEXMF/dvips//
      < % Had to add the $VARTEXFONTS 21/07/04 PAM
      ---
      > TEXCONFIG = .;$TEXMF/dvips//
      
Moreover, I would maintain that the benefits of making /usr a read-only
partition are too numerous to list.  It should be one of the first steps 
in securing against invasion from crackers.

I borrowed it from a friend and checked it out. It seems good but not a whole
lot of pages. I would like to know more about how Latex works, that is, "the
inner workings" so to speak.I have been told that Kopka's book is very
extensive. But I don't know if it has more on "designing yourself"?!

I ran into a problem recently and thought you have the answer.  I was
using Photshop trying to convert JPEG (color plot from computer output -
Fieldview) format to EPS format. Although it is recognized in Photoshop
(both JPEG and EPS formats), it can not be read into Ghostview, neither
by my Latex compiler.  

I have used the same process in the past from TIFF file (scanned B&W)
without any problem.  I do not know if the color made the difference, or
the original file format (JPEG vs TIFF).  

You reply is very much appreciated.

there are no books, really, on how latex works.  k&d (i don't know
about kopka's german version) has extensive details on skating round
the periphery, but little (if anything) on the innards.

there was talk of a tome on design at one stage.  i don't know what
came of it.  i keep making fitful moves towards a web site that will
document latex internals, but i've not touched the prototype (plain
text) document for more than a month.  and i've no clear ideas about
extending it to "design considerations".

I would _love_ to see this text.

For the interim, I've found that I've been able to be fairly 
self-sufficient in doing fairly complex book macros / design / 
formatting through the following:

  - first, check the FAQ - this solves better than 90% of typical 
difficulties IME.

  - check CTAN to see if there is a package for one's problem-space.

  - read _all_ of the documentation for the documentclass/package one is 
working with.

[optional] - use the Memoir class, it has an excellent manual, and the 
documented source is quite good.

  - use the freely available _TeX for the Impatient_ to get the low-down 
on TeX internals at need, or when falling back on raw TeX at need. 
Victor Eijkhout's _TeX by Topic is also available (but not free, and 
I've not found occasion to send him a check, so I try not to use it --- 
at some point I'll have to do that, but in the interim, at least my 
conscience is clear)

  - get a copy of _The LaTeX Companion, 2nd Edition_ --- the index is 
quite good in the new edition, and most topics are addressed quite 
nicely.

  - use http://groups.google.com to see how others have faced similar 
difficulties (there've only been one or two which I couldn't find 
in-depth, high-level, erudite discussions on)

and lastly (and this is probably the bit which most directly applies)

  - build and look through source2e.pdf (Use the Source Luke).

That last I find tough sledding at times, and that comes back to the 
crux of our discussion, that there's no single place to get the 
knowledge / understanding which one needs to hit the ground running 
when reading it.

For me, the best source, obsolete though it may be, for the design of 
latex is the source file latex.tex, for latex 2.09.  It is wrong on the 
changes made in latex 2e, but there is an awful lot that hasn't.  In it, 
Lamport really tried to explain what he was doing and how to modify it and 
I still use it extensively.  It is still on CTAN, although no longer

um ... where the source of latex 2e hasn't had updated comments added,
the 2.09 comments are still there.  what's wrong with source2e, then?

Since no one has mentioned it, the alternative to worrying about
permissions, running mktexlsr, and which partitions to put things in (so
personal .sty's and such won't get lost when you upgrade your system) is
to put them wherever you like, e.g., in a directory called LATEX in your
home space (or wherever) and use the TEXINPUTS environment variable to
tell your tex installation where to look for things. My .cshrc sets this
environment variable as

setenv TEXINPUTS .:/usr/lib/latex2html/texinputs:/home/sjs/SJSLATEX//:
 
where the trailing "//" descends recursively down my personal directory
and the trailing ":" ensures the standard distribution is picked up.
Dropping .sty files, or package folders, into SJSLATEX makes them
instantly available to latex. I guess latex searches down this set of
paths in the order shown, and quirky things can happen if there are
multiple occurences of packages which aren't identical, but your log
file will tell you where latex found each package you call out in your
source.

For shared installations, it's more robust to reconfigure the local
texmf tree rather than rely on all users to set the appropriate
environment variable, but the above works well, especially when you're
up against a deadline!

Subject: [texhax] bibtex error message
Message-ID: <1096222837.18276.13.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I am encountering the following when I try to run bibtex:

$ latex report.tex
$ bibtex report
bibtex: Need exactly one file argument.
Try 'bibtex --help' for more information.

I don't think bibtex even starts as there are no .bbl or .blg files
created. I am running latex/teTEX on Redhat 9. I tried to reinstall all
of the teTeX files, but that did not change matters.  If I copy .bbl &
.blg files after bibtexing in Windows and then latex in linux,
everything links up fine - but this is a pain.

Any suggestions on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.

Bill

This is utterly bizarre.

Do you have an alias or shell script masking the bibtex binary?  Do
"type bibtex" (I guess you're using bash from the prompt) to make sure
you're invoking what you seem to be.  Or specify the
/full/path/to/bibtex report.  Finally, does bibtex --help print a help

Subject: [texhax] Dirty lines when printing pdf
Message-ID: <20040927180739.GA16164@debian>

I'm using Latex on Debian (standard Sarge install), and everything run fines
after compiling with pdflatex except the following: I have a neat pdf look
when I view it with a pdf-reader. However, the printed output contains
several lines that are a bold and blurr (dirty feeling). They appear here and
there, though not very often.

Did you experience such a failure mode ? What's wrong with the preamble ?  I
really can't find a way yo solve this problem.

Thanks for you help!

NB: my preamble is this:
\documentclass[10pt]{article}

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage[frenchb]{babel}
\usepackage{geometry}

This is one of the things that can happen when you don't embed the base 14  
fonts.

I don't have a linux box, but I think running this should work:

updmap --setoption pdftexDownloadBase14 true

When you install an RPM package it will usually go in /usr.  You may not
do that very often, but keeping up with OS updates can sometimes involve
daily installations.  Of course I'm talking here from the point of view
of Red Hat or Fedora, but it probably applies to other distributions
too.

>/usr/local will have to be on a distinct partition, of course.
>My /usr/local --> /opt/local (which indicates a long past experience

Conversely, I have /opt -> /usr/local/opt. :-)

As has been already pointed out, this copies only the directory
structure and not the files themselves (although in my opinion this
will still give a rather large number of directories that you'll have
no need for).

>The one lot of things you do have to copy out of /usr is the binaries
>you actually use, which must be in /usr/local/bin (links won't work).

I think you're thinking here of where it will find the texmf.cnf file,
but if you need to edit it then it's probably better just to bite the
bullet and edit the copy in /usr/share/texmf rather than install a whole
new collection of TeX binaries.  I don't like editing things in /usr,
but it is at least listed as a config file in the RPM package (I suspect
I'd have made it a symlink to somewhere in /etc if I'd been packaging
it).  If you really don't want to do that then you can set the TEXMFCNF
environment variable.  Usually, though, texmf.cnf doesn't need editing
as it's already configured to look in /usr/local/share/texmf as well as
$HOME/texmf.

[from a later post]

It takes about 10 seconds to remount a /usr partition read-write, so I
seriously doubt it will be any hindrance to a cracker.  (Of course, in
saying that I've defeated my argument in the first paragraph!)

Under linux debian testing (Sarge), I've just compiled your tex file with 
pdflatex run twice and printed the pdf file via acroread. The printed pages 
look very good.

I really dunno!

Problem sorted, there was a script that was masking the bibtex binary.
Once removed everything worked fine.

Hi, I'd like to know if you can help me with a little issue. When I use
\Rightarrow sequence, or any related sequence (\Leftrightarrow,
\Longrightarrow, \iff), and compile using pdflatex, I get a colon (:)
instead the desired arrow. This doesn't occur when using \Leftarrow, or
\to. I'll appreciate any help or suggestion.

Best wishes,

Rodrigo.

as you can imagine, this is a pretty open ended question.  it's difficult
to answer without knowing things like what system are you using, what sort
of documents are you creating, what is the input, and what is the output.

if you simply want a text editor to output .pdf rather than .doc or .txt,
maybe have a look at openoffice

http://www.openoffice.org/

which is just a suite of office tools, and the writer will output just
about any type of document that you can want.

of course, there's also tex and latex, and if you want to learn about
those, just ask.

As Morten noted, you didn't have things set to embed the fonts when 
this .pdf was made.

At screen resolution, substituting one font for another may not be too 
noticeable, but at print time, it can be, and your printer may not 
support multiple master fonts well (which is what Acrobat Reader is 
using when it can't find the real font).

If setting things to download the fonts doesn't work, you may have a 
printer w/ a buggy PS RIP (PostScript Raster Image Processor).

After a fashion.

There are shareware implementations of TeX (cmactex and oztex) which 
include pdftex which can convert a file into a .pdf --- you'd have to 
add some bit of text at the end (\vfill\eject\bye) and not use any 
characters with special meaning to TeX (or put code at the beginning of 
the file to keep them from interfering).

Unfortunately, AFAIK, none of the programs mentioned thus far work on 
System 8.1

You _might_ be able to use Perl for this --- I believe it has a pdf 
creation module.

Probably it'd be easier for you to just get an older copy of Adobe 
Acrobat Distiller (it comes bundled w/ most Adobe products) and use 
that, printing from BBEdit Lite or some such.

Could you write a _minimal_ example with the problem? In the example, just
add the lines 

\show\Rightarrow

Compiling would stop to show you how \Rightarrow is defined. At the prompt,
press `q'. This definition would be in you <filename>.log file too. Please
also include those line(s) (not the entire log file).

With regards,
Manoj.

Thanks to all, guys.
I applied Morten's advice on updmap,and now it prints ok.
I even tried the euro font, which cause me the problem all the time.
Strange that Vittorio was OK with this (same OS, with apt-get Latex stuff) : did you tune this updmap thing, or
run all by default ?

I really appreciated your feedback (btw I'm using Sarge Debian with CUPS, and
my printer is an Epson480..)

Bye!

This is true, but

                  sudo mount -o remount,rw /usr

is a pretty simple answer, at least for individuals.  It would
probably work in systems where /usr was widely shared also.

Well, as a matter of fact when updating my latex installation via apt-get 
update and apt-get upgrade a mistake popped up while the system was running 
initex saying that there was something wrong with the lambda & omega formats 
and preventing the installation of tetex-bin and tetex-extra. Therefore I 
manually corrected the /etc/texmf/fmt.d/00tetex.cnf commenting out both 
formats. Then I smoothly ran apt-get install -f and it was all ok.

By the way, here is what I use to include marvosym:

% Work around some bugs in marvosym with overwriting symbols:
\let\labOrigRightarrow=\Rightarrow
        \RequirePackage{marvosym}
        \let\Rightarrow=\labOrigRightarrow

Do you print directly from your pdf reader?  If yes, which one do you
use?

How is the translation of $x'$ into $x^{\prime}$ implemented?

I am asking for three reasons:
1. I would like to change it to a different version of the prime 
symbol, without messing with \prime;
2. I would also like to implement that $x''$ be interpreted as 
$x^{\second}$, where \second is a better kerned version of two 
\prime's;
3. I am just damn curious.

The 2004 TeX Live software won't be mailed in the next few weeks, anyway. 
Sorry. Testing isn't complete, yet. You can, if you prefer, order the 2003 
software *instead of* the 2004 version, which is available to mail right 
away. Just let me know please. If you'd like to purchase the 2004 software 
later, you can, of course do that as well for a minimal fee.

Thanks so much for checking.

Dear TUG

I recently joined the TeX users group, and am eager to get up an running, e.g. with some simple Latex applications.

Today I received a Fed Ex package with the TugBoat 23:3/4, 2002 and preprints for the 2004 annual meeting.

I understand I will also be receiving a DVD with software, etc.    When it this likely to be shipped ?

it's simple if you're using latex (at least in a current
installation).  simply

  \usepackage{mathptmx}

and you get the best latex can manage, by way of adobe times.  (for
really good results you would also need some times maths fonts, but
these cost real money.)

adobe times isn't exactly times new, but it's near enough for most
university administrators.

if you're using plain tex, i don't know how to do the job, i'm afraid.

Hi Alexandru,

    >> How is the translation of $x'$ into $x^{\prime}$ implemented?

See plain.tex and the TeXbook and/or TeX for the Impatient (I think we
talked about this in TFTI, although I don't recall for sure).

The short answer is:
\mathcode`\'="8000
This makes ' be an active character in math mode.

The definition starts like this:
{\catcode\'=\active \gdef'{^\bgroup\prim@s}}

\prim@s uses \futurelet to look for multiple consecutive ' characters.

Hope this helps,
karl

Dear List,

I'm using package curve for designing my CV, and need to have more than one 
line in some of the subrubrics. Otherwise the contents run off the margins. 
The documentation does not show how to do this, and using the standard '\\' 
command doesn't work. Any work-arounds?

Sebastian

The URW fonts should be installed or at least easy to install.

Try running this small test file though pdflatex:

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
   \usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n} Works fine!
   \showoutput
\end{document}

I get this log-file:
