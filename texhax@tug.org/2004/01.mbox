I use c:\TeX\texmf etc., but that is my personal choice.  MiKTeX will
suggest creating \texmf (for package files) AND \localtexmf (for personal
files) you may even find you want another; it clearly makes sense to have
these all under one base, e.g. c:\TeX.

And do as in point 3. above.

First of all, this is a VVVFAQ and a look through previous posting would
have found the answer (already repeated many, many times).  Try looking up
Q.98 "Imported graphics in PDFLATEX" in the present

This has nothiing to do with WinEdt, which does, incidentally, have its own
list.

Why ?

Because (and this is THE VVVFAQ) .pdf can't handle .ps gthey need to be
converted properly.

> - The .dvi to .ps works fine.

Because .eps files are ok for a .ps output.

> - The .ps to .pdf works OK but then I have some problems with some fonts.

You didn't include your .pdf output.  But I would guess you didn't use all
of the necessary options for creating the .ps file.  These are:  -P
pdf -G0 -t A4 (you can give them in the window that opens in WinEdt for
dvips).

Alternatively, convert your .eps to .pdf (or .png or .jpg), insert those and
then use pdflatex.

My 2 cents: if LaTeX was self-documenting like Emacs Lisp, presumably
there wouldn't have to be the same kind of huge after the fact
documentation efforts.  "Literate Programming" for LaTeX shouldn't be
such a far out notion.

winedt (i presume) has one of the bettter ones.

you probably need to go the whole hog and use wordcount.tex; which
will be an interesting exercise on a widnoze machine.

Subject: [texhax] parsing the LaTeX log
Message-ID: <200401031457.53848.Jeroen.Wijnhout@kdemail.net>

Hi,

Some (La)TeX editors extract errors from the log file, in order to present an 
easy to read list of errors/warnings to the user. However parsing the log 
file isn't easy. Different versions of TeX ( LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, pdfTeX) use 
different ways to write errors to the log file. Also sometimes a piece of the 
source file is printed along with the error (the context), this makes parsing 
a real challenge!

I was sort of wondering if there is a (La)TeX package available that can show 
(La)TeX errors in a standard representation. For example, instead of printing 

! Undefined control sequence.
l.7 \test

to the log file, print:
test.tex:7:"! Undefined control sequence.":"\test"
to a file test.errors.

This would make an automatic error extraction trivial. Is this possible at 
all? What are the tools I can use?

best,
Jeroen

Message-ID: <1073142196.6952.37.camel@localhost>

hi,
i tried create my custom tex verbatim macro, that takes input text
between \verbatim  ... \verbatimend, prints it without interpreting (
like other verbatim macros do), prints some separator and finally prints
the input text processed by tex.

ex: \berbatim $a \rightarrow b$ 
output: $a \rightarrow b$  --  a->b

My problem is that i can read input, set category of special characters
to 12, print non-interpreted text but i can't set category of special
characters back to get interpreted output. 
So i get output: $a \rightarrow b$  -- $a \rightarrow b$

Can anubody help me, please?

Code:

\def\verbatimsep{--}
\chardef\other=12
\def\do#1{\catcode`#1=\other}
\long\def\normalprint#1{%

Subject: [texhax] windows developer for TeX Live?
Message-ID: <200401032251.i03MpX009390@f7.net>

As we start another development cycle for TeX Live, we thought it an
opportune time to ask for additional volunteers.

One particular task that could use additional assistance is the Windows
support, i.e., fpTeX (http://www.fptex.org), the Windows port of Web2c.
Fabrice (Popineau) continues to do an amazing job on this, but if any
there are any other experienced Windows programmers out there who could
help, that would be great.

Just as an example, windvi is somewhat stalled behind xdvi, since
Fabrice has been concentrating on pdf support.

Also for Windows and for the whole distribution, we'd love to get more
testing in *advance* of the release this year.  Last year, we got a
number of reports only after the final CD's were cut.  Too late.

If you're interested, willing, and able, please let me know.

Thanks,
karl

You can do this by putting a picture environment in a page footer or
header.  Try something like this:

\makeatletter
\def\@oddhead{\hspace{-85pt}\raisebox{-650pt}[0pt][0pt]{%
\setlength{\unitlength}{1in}
\begin{picture}(7.0,10)(0,0)%
\put(0.0,0.0){\line(1,2){5.0}}
\end{picture}}}
\makeatother

This is set up to measure from somewhere in the lower left of the
page, but you can fiddle with all the numbers to get the lines to land
where you like.

Hope this helps,

treat the marks as a water-mark-like picture, and use eso-pic, i
guess.

unless the marks are the only thing on the page (origami diagrams), in
which case use textpos

Best way I found to recover most of the equations and tables is to strip
the (La)TeX commands (by detex and manually) and import the the plain text
to word. Or convert the dvi to plain text as dvi2tty and catdvi do, though 
this will also loose some mathematical signs and readability depending on 
the options. 

Any converter is limited, especially so is latex2rtf or tex2word, due mainly
to the limits of word typesetting.

BTW: Did anyone try to create a dvi2word routine? Since word is *supposed* to 
     be a wysiwig program and to support tables and equations and bitmap 
     figures, this should be another way to crack the problem.

Dear Tom,
        I have followed this thread with interest. I have heard this question asked many times. My opinion, which may be incorrect, is that it's easy to translate text, footnotes, bibliography, and even simple macros from LaTeX to Word. It is less easy to translate formulas, although rough translation of math symbols and Greek letters is possible and easy. More complicated stuff cannot be translated, unless you create the TeX formulas with special software. Figures are impossible to translate.
        Please correct me, someone, if I am wrong here.
        I wrote my own translator from LaTeX to rtf (the rtf language is public), which is readable by Word and other word-processing software. I'm sure the CTAN translators are fine for simple stuff, since I had no trouble writing my own.
        If you do all your figures in eps, both LaTeX and Word can handle them. As for complex formulas, there is no way, unless you convert them to eps or something else Word can read, possibly from a pdf file. I don't know. 

Best,

Herb

Surely it's better to convert to HTML, via LaTeX2HTML or TeX4ht,
then open the .html files with M$word, and resave as .doc or .rtf .
Not only will that preserve the tables, but it will give decent images
of the mathematics, which is the best you can expect from M$word anyway.

If you need to do this a lot, then it's worth exploring all the options
that are available with LaTeX2HTML, to determine how to get the best
results with the kind of LaTeX documents that you need to convert.

If you really don't like images for the mathematics, then LaTeX2HTML
provides the original LaTeX source as HTML comments, so you can take
that and deal with it in some other way.


Have fun,

My opinion, which may be incorrect, is that it's easy to translate text, footnotes, bibliography, and even simple macros from LaTeX to Word. It is less easy to translate formulas, although rough translation of math symbols and Greek letters is possible and easy. More complicated stuff cannot be translated, unless you create the TeX formulas with special software. Figures are impossible to translate.

Subject: [texhax] cleardoublepage causes an error in pdf files
Message-ID: <3FF96A95.DCC7DE85@uniroma1.it>

I'm using the fancyhdr package to format the page header.

My document is two-sided so, when chapters end on odd pages, a blank
page is generated by the \cleardoublepage command.

Since I don't want any header on those blank pages, i redefined the
\cleardoublepage command as suggested in the fancyhdr package
documentation, adding a \thispagestyle{empty} command:

\renewcommand\cleardoublepage{\clearpage\if@twoside \ifodd\c@page\else

\hbox{}\thispagestyle{empty}\newpage\if@twocolumn\hbox{}\newpage\fi\fi\fi}

After converting the .tex file to .pdf using dvips and then ps2pdf (no,
I cannot use pdftex to avoid passing through the .ps file) I display the
.pdf file with Acrobat Reader. Everything works fine except when I
display the blank pages generated by \cleardoublepage: in this case I
get the following error

"The page contents object has the wrong type"

Does anybody know how to fix this problem?
Thank you

Agreed.  Scott Prahl (prahl@bme.ogi.ed) has gotten latex2rtf into
pretty good form - good enough that all the simple formulas in our
recently published paper translated without a hitch:

Perhaps you and Scott could compare notes.

Right, unless you are submitting a paper to a journal, in which case
images may not be acceptable.

Message-ID: <327570-220041152219419@M2W076.mail2web.com>

I am printing a book using memoir. I have read memman but I am left with a
question.

How do I put the printed pages into a booklet? It must be related to the
signature but I cannot get it working. I am not printing on big paper that
is to be folded ant then cut.

My goal is to print on both sides of letter paper and stack the paper 
so that in landscape I see page one on the right half of the page and 
on the back side of half is side two. I can't figure what should be on the
left side.

I would appreciate some reference to slove this problem.

John

This is called ``imposition'', or ``imposing the pages''.

You'll want to look at the psutils, esp. psbook and psnup, or at Peter 
Wilson's ``booklet'' package on CTAN.

Easy way to do it by hand is to start w/ a drawn grid matching the 
number of needed pages matched up to sheets:

--|--
--|--

Then fill in starting on the right w/ odd numbers and work down and 
diagonally:

--| 1
3 |--

Then, when you get to the bottom, start at 2 and work back up w/ even 
numbers:

4 | 1
3 | 2

You can check that by taking a sheet of paper, folding it in half, and 
numbering it from 1--4 for the pages.

John:

I'm sure there is a clever TeX way to get this done automatically, and
someone else on the list can answer.  But you can do what you want by
making the postcript first, and using the "impose" utilities
which are free perl scripts, to combine the PS pages into a booklet.
Look at: http://imagic.weizmann.ac.il/~dov/freesw/impose+/

Hope this helps,

Subject: [texhax] adjusting the space between characters
Message-ID: <20040107044333.GD6873@whirlwind.furman.edu>

I have been searching everywhere for transliteration characters to use
for the Hebrew characters aleph and ayin.  When I had given up hope, I
found acceptable glyphs in the txfonts package (txmi font, labelled
lhook and rhook, IIRC).  I have to put the (math) character into
superscript because it must be in the upper part of the register.

My problem is that when I put the transliterated word into emphasis, all
of the characters except for the hook slant to the right.  This makes
the hook appear too close to the previous character and too far from the
next one.

How might I tweak it so that the hook is still centered when the word
is in italic?  Is there a better way to raise the hook than with
superscript?  Can I nudge the character to the right just a bit?

Any pointers will be greatly appreciated.

Message-ID: <3FFB02B8.AF2694E1@wku.edu>


Hi!

I am an old member of TUG. I have paid 65 dollars every
year to get help to install a TeX equipment on my PC.
I have tried to install TeXLive on the hard drive of my PC
every year, and I have never been able to install it correctly
so far.

     This year, I would like to install it without mistakes.

I have received TeXLive, Edition 9, 2003 from TUG.

I have a new PC, Dell, Optiplex, GX 260,
Operating system: Microsoft Window XP
Processor: Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.66 GHz
512 MB RAM
Hard disk: 37.2 GB,         32.5 GB of free space.

My PC is new and it has never had any TeX system before.

My PC is connected to the network
of Western Kentucky University.

I would like to install the most absolutely totally complete
TeX equipment on my hard disk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1: Last year, I paid 40 dollars for a license for
WinEdt, and I do have my license number. Is it possible
to install WinEdt at the same time I install TeXLive ? If not,
in what folder of TeXLive should I install WinEdt ? How do
I connect WinEdt to TeXLive ? So far, it has never worked
correctly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2: Do both the "CD install" and the "DVD" contain
the exactly the same totally complete system, with only the
difference that one is compressed and the other one is not
compressed ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3: I am reading the instructions to install
TeXLive on

http://www.tug.org/docs/tldoc/english/livese6.html#x9-230006

where I read that on page 1 of the "Wizard",
Figure 2, we have to choose between:

1. Quick install
2. Install for all users
3. Install XEmTeX support.

I cannot choose 1, because I do not want a partial install,
I want an absolutely complete install.

I cannot choose 2, because I want to install on my own
PC, for myself, not on all the PC's of the university, for all
of the members of the university who don't even know me.

I cannot choose 3, because it installs only XEmTeX support,
and nothing else. What I want is everything, the most
complete TeX system.

Which one must I choose to get the complete
system ? Should I first run 1 and second run 3 ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4: On Figure 2, we must give the address of
a local depot for files on the CDROM. What's that ?
How can we choose or determine this address ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5: On Figure 3, we must give the address of
"Home TeXMF Tree". It is extremely important that I give
an address, otherwise, the other years, I had files going
to servers of the university anywhere, except on my own
PC. Should I give

c:\TeXLive2003\                              ?????
or c:\TeXLive2003\Home                  ?????
or c:\TeXLive2003\texmf-----home      ????
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6; On Figure 3, "Scheme selection", which
scheme should I choose to get the most totally
complete TeX system ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 7: On Figure 4, is there a fast way to select
absolutely all the packages ? I know absolutely none
of the names of the files. The only way for me is to select
all the files. How can I select absolutely all these files
without having to check all of these boxes for several
hours ?

     I hope you can help me.

    I have tried to install TeXLive on the hard drive of my PC
    every year, and I have never been able to install it correctly
    so far.

I'm sorry to hear it.  I don't use Windows myself, so my help is going
to be limited, but I'll answer what I can.  I hope some of the Windows
experts on this list will help with your questions.

    Question 2: Do both the "CD install" and the "DVD" contain
    the exactly the same totally complete system, 

Yes.

    2. Install for all users

I think you want this one, because I believe the option really means
"all users on the current computer".  It's not going to go out and mess
with anything on the network.  The wording is unfortunate.

    Question 4: On Figure 2, we must give the address of
    a local depot for files on the CDROM. What's that ?
    How can we choose or determine this address ?

That's the drive letter where the TeX Live CD is available under
Windows.  Usually G:.  You can find out by looking under My Computer, if
you don't know.

    Question 5: On Figure 3, we must give the address of
    "Home TeXMF Tree"

I believe that's for a "home directory".  You don't need it.  Make sure
all the other entries use directories on your local disk.

    Question 6; On Figure 3, "Scheme selection", which
    scheme should I choose to get the most totally
    complete TeX system ?

In the Unix install, there is an option "Generic Full TeXLive scheme".
I hope it is there in Windows too.  But I don't think the scheme is
crucial.  It's the package/collection selection which determines what
really gets installed.

    Question 7: On Figure 4, is there a fast way to select
    absolutely all the packages ? 

I sure hope so, but I don't see it mentioned in the documentation :(.
On Unix, you can just choose "+" to install everything (this is what I
always do myself).  Is there a root package you can select that will
automatically select everything else.


I hope this is a little help, anyway.  Sorry I can't speak authoritatively.

For Pinyin, you don't need anything additional.

\"u will give you the high, front rounded vowel
\={vowel} will give you first tone
\'{vowel} will give you second tone
\v{vowel} will give you third tone
\`{vowel} will give you fourth tone

I use accentbx.sty to allow for a tone mark over a \"u, and use \i to 
undot the i when you need it.

Reply-To: "TeX on Mac OS X Mailing List" <MacOSX-TeX@email.esm.psu.edu>

The original instructions are by Olivier Delloye -- thank you Olivier!
Without your help I feel I would never have succeded with the 
installation!

Renaming "Cyberbit.ttf" (in step 3) was absent from the original 
instructions
and I've changed step 5 and a few other things -- So don't blame Olivier
if you have problems!


1. Installation of UCS Package
- Download "ucs" package from: http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/latex/unicode/
   uncompress/untar the file
   move the whole "ucs" directory to somewhere appropriate in your 
TeX-tree
   (e.g. /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/tex/latex/ucs/)

2. Installation of CJK Package
- download "cjk" package from: http://cjk.ffii.org/
- uncompress/untar the "cjk-4.5.1.tar.gz" file
- move the whole directory to somewhere appropriate in your TeX-tree
   (e.g. /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/tex/latex/cjk/)

3. Installation of Unicode True Type font (cyberbit)
- download "Cyberbit.ZIP" file from:
   ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/
   uncompress it and rename "Cyberbit.ttf" to "cyberbit.ttf" (no 
capitals)
- download "Unicode.sfd" file from: http://delloye.free.fr/Unicode.sfd
- make sure "cyberbit.ttf" and "Unicode.sfd" are in the same directory
- from the terminal, go to that directory and run
   "ttf2tfm cyberbit.ttf -w cyberbit@Unicode@"
   in order to create ".tfm" and ".enc" files
- move all the ".tfm" files to somewhere appropriate in your TeX-tree
   (e.g. /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/fonts/tfm/bitstrea/cyberbit)
- move all the ".enc" files to somewhere appropriate in your TeX-tree
   (e.g. /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/pdftex/enc/)
- download "cyberbit.map" file from: http://delloye.free.fr/cyberbit.map
   and move it to somewhere appropriate in your TeX-tree
   (e.g. /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/pdftex/config/)
- download "c70cyberbit.fd" file from: 
http://delloye.free.fr/c70cyberbit.fd
   and move it to somewhere appropriate in your TeX-tree
   (e.g. /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/tex/latex/cyberbit/)
- move the "cyberbit.ttf" to somewhere appropriate in your TeX-tree
   (e.g. /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.local/fonts/truetype/ -- check in 
your
   /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf file the "%TrueType 
outline
   fonts" line and the "TTFONTS" value. You have to copy the 
Cybebrbit.ttf file
   in a directory included in the TTFONTS path.)

4. Declaration of the new font
- open /usr/local/tetex/share/texmf.local/web2c/updmap.cfg (if there is 
none,
   first copy it from 
/usr/local/tetex/share/texmf.tetex/web2c/updmap.cfg)
   and add this line "MixedMap cyberbit.map" (without quotes) to the 
file.
- run "sudo texhash" in the terminal
- run "sudo updmap" in the terminal

5. Using the new environment in LaTeX
You just need to include the three following lines in the preamble :
   \usepackage[encapsulated]{CJK}
   \usepackage{ucs}
   \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
It may also be a good idea to create a new command :
   \newcommand{\cjktext}[1]{\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{cyberbit}#1\end{CJK}}
Now, when you want to type chinese, you just use the command:
   \cjktext{enter your chinese text here}

I can see two ways:

1. a local hack - use (every time!)

\bgroup%
\let\oldtheequation\theequation
\def\theequation{\oldtheequation.}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{...}
...
\end{...}
\end{subequations}
\egroup%

2. a global hack - copy the amsmath defnition of the subequations
environment and put the period in yourself - can you see it below?  Beware
though, amsmath may change the original definition in some future upgrade,
without notification!  Note too the \renewenvironment.

\makeatletter
\renewenvironment{subequations}{%
  \refstepcounter{equation}%
  \protected@edef\theparentequation{\theequation}%
  \setcounter{parentequation}{\value{equation}}%
  \setcounter{equation}{0}%
  \def\theequation{\theparentequation.\alph{equation}}%
  \ignorespaces
}{%
  \setcounter{equation}{\value{parentequation}}%
  \ignorespacesafterend
}
\makeatother

The \makeatletter \makeatother pair are necessary if you put this in your
preamble but not if you put it in, say, 'subeqhack.sty' and load that with
\usepackage{subeqhack} AFTER amsmath.

Setting \exhyphenpenalty10000 does what do you want to achieve.

The "amsmath" package defines the command \nobreakdash, which does exactly
what you want.  See the documentation amsldoc.dvi (Se. 4.4) for usage.

You don't say what success if any you have had; but, assuming none, try the
the cancel package - it does just what you want.  This could have been
found, e.g., by looking at

 Q. 193 "Cancelling terms in maths expressions"

 http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq

If you don't find this solution aesthetically acceptable, try looking in
symbols-a4.pdf (available on CTAN if it isn't in you installation) and
you'll find tipa fonts have \textglobrise and txfonts \nearrow it shouldn't
be difficult to tack on a "0" (at worst use the \raisebox command) and then
superpose (here you might look at the slashed.sty package (available on
CTAN) for how to superpose symbols like /.

I believe this is one of those "you can't get there from here"
situations. :-)

You can relatively easily (\hskip, \raise, \scriptscriptstyle, and
twiddling) put that ) at the end of the arrow. However, if you then
\hskip back os the arrow lies on top of something, everything behind the
box which holds the arrow/0 is obliterated. TeX fonts are not
transparent.

One relatively direct solution if you have only a few symbols to
overstrike, would be to find them in a Metafont source, add the arrow
and thereby generate a font with the arrows over the selected
characters. This would probably require a bit of learning curve
investment with metafont. :-(

A second workaround which come to mind (again if there is not too many
characters to be overstruck) would be to put them out as eps figures and
use pstricks to add the overstrike. Again this would require some
investment in self-training. :-(  However, pstricks is a nice tool/toy
to have in your armamentarium so it might be worth the time. :-)

(I confess that I am not expert enough to be certain there is no
alternative, but write since I noticed nobody else replied and I did not
want you left hanging completely.)

I'm working on editing a fairly huge tex document (will be approx.
1800 pages long) written by a few hundred people. Each of the
sections originally had its own unique preamble, but I've collected
and sorted the information in these preambles and made one (giant)
preamble.  This is allowing me to take a first pass through the
document and fix latex bugs.  But I've had to make some compromises,
as you can well imagine (choosing one alternative among various
commands with a certain name).  I was wondering if there is a way to
redefine \newcommand so that it is only active within each TeX
section. If I could do this, then next time I do this, I'd have a
lot less to sort through, and there wouldn't be the same name-space
conflicts among the commands (of course, I'd want to make sure to
change all \def commands etc. into the redefined
\newcommand). Advice?

http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=BigOh

    Suppose f(x) and g(x) are real valued functions defined for all x
    greater than some fixed positive real x0. We write

	     f(x) = O(g(x))     (and we say "f(x) is big-O of g(x)"),

       if there is some constant C such that

	     |f(x)| < C.g(x)

       That is, f(x) is O(g(x)) if f is bounded by a constant times g.

       For example, 53x2+23x+500 = O(x2), sin(x) = O(1), and any
       polynomial in x of degree at most n is O(xn).

       This big-O notation was introduced by P.  Brachmann in 1894.

    x0 (where x0 is a fixed positive real). We write

	     f(x) = o(g(x))

       if the limit as x approaches infinity of f(x)/g(x) is zero (that
       is, if eventually f(x)/g(x) becomes less than any given positive
       number). Examples:  10000x = o(x2), log(x) = o(x), and xn =
       o(ex). Notice that f(x) = o(g(x)) implies, and is stronger than,
       f(x) = O(g(x)).

       We often use the little-oh notation this way:

	     f(x) = g(x) + o(h(x)).

       This intuitively means that the error in using g(x) to
       approximate f(x) is negligible in comparison to h(x).

       The little-oh notation was first used by E.  Landau in 1909.

    redefine \newcommand so that it is only active within each TeX
    section.

Sorry for my ignorance, but how about simply enclosing each section
within \begingroup ... \endgroup?

Failing that, the other idea that comes to mind is to define a new
\newcommand which makes its new command name unique by adding a suffix
based on the section number.

After reading the above I wondered whether I had misread the TeXbook on
how TeX deals with boxes  :-(  so I decided to play a bit (one way to
explore) and simply tried a few options, specifically my first impulse
to simple code it in TeX and then some examples with the cancel and
slashed styles. In case anyone wants to see the results, I attach a
brief TeX file. Just TeX it and look at the .dvi result. (And, as with
all open source, you can then play with it to your heart's content!)
(and, as with all ASCII files, you can download this .tex file with no
fear of viruses; just like the good old days!)

Nothing special about the symbols, but I prefer:

\providecommand{\OO}[1]{\mathop{\mathrm{O}}\bigl(#1\bigr)}

or (with AMSmath)
\providecommand{\OO}[1]{\operatorname{O}\bigl(#1\bigr)}


and use:
   $\OO{f(n)}$

and similarly for  \oo{f(n)} .


Note the
  i.  slightly larger outer parentheses
  ii. operator spacing
 iii. easier to read in the body of the manuscript
  iv. easier to override (by redefining or pre-defining \OO )
       in the documentclass or other packages
      (especially valuable for editing journals/proceedings)


(for Barbara)
This big-O and little-o notation is sufficiently common in Applied Maths
fields that it deserves special support within AMS-packages, at least
to try to establish some uniformity of implementation.
Yes, it should be considered for STIX, IMHO.


Cheers

   Now try something like

Thanks to all who answered concerning Big-O, little-o notation.
Distilling the various answers, my own solution, within AMSmath,
is to put in the preamble:

\DeclareMathOperator{\BigO}{O}
\DeclareMathOperator{\littleo}{o}

which essentially defines \BigO as \mathrm{O}, etc.

and allows for the author to choose between (,); \bigl(,\bigr); or
\left(,\right) for delimiters, as needed.

Ross Moore's solution

\providecommand{\OO}[1]{\operatorname{O}\bigl(#1\bigr)}

with usage

$\OO{f(n)}$

is elegant, and has a number of nice features, but is less flexible
in allowing for really big arguments in a displayed equation.

Well, you could substitute \bigl and \bigr with \left and \right:

\providecommand{\OO}[1]{\operatorname{O}\left(#1\right)}

Inserting something like \strut between a should also guarantee a slightly
larger pair always.

Subject: [texhax] using latex as a preprocessor
Message-ID: <E1AfKRt-0000nh-00@linux183.ma.utexas.edu>

This is almost (but not quite) a follow-up to my question about how
to typeset large multi-author documents -- which Ross had very
complete off-list answer for, so thanks again to him for that!

Here's the new question: when I was thinking about possible
approaches for typesetting a multi-author document, one possibility
I thought of would be to preprocess the document I made (essentially
the concatenation of all the files I'm working with, with the
preambles sorted out and moved to the front of the document) and
translate all user-defined macros back into the commands they stand
for.  For example, if we have the command

  \def\mobius#1#2#3#4#5{\frac{#2#1 + #3}{#4#1 + #5}}  

then wherever you see something like

  \mobius{z}{a}{b}{c}{d}

write

  \frac{az + b}{cz + d}}

and so on for all the other commands. (This would eliminate
name-space conflicts.) I'm curious to know if you can do this sort
of thing with latex, or if it is best done (if at all) with some
other (programming) language.

Subject: [texhax] footnote
Message-ID: <200401111330478.SM01020@Debug>

Hi,
I am trying to make changes to how my
footnotes are set. Normally, the index of the
footnote is superscripted, but I want it to
be normalized. In Lamport's Latex book it
says that I can make rename the relevant
package, i.e. footmisc.sty (to
'fspFootmisc.sty), make the changes I want in
the new file, and add usepackage{fspFootmisc}
to my .tex-document. When I do this I get the
following error:

Package `vmargin', V2.2, <1999/06/01>
)
(/usr/local/stow/share/texmf/tex/latex/misc/a4wide.sty

(fspFootmisc.sty

I am working on a system at my university
where I cannot place packages in the latex
folder. I can only put new packages in my own
account/folder: Must I make changes in my
shell? This last question might reveal just
how little I know about this whole subject.
Thanks

in the version of the package i'm running, that text appears in:

the only way you could have been trying to typeset it would be if you
had removed the comment marker on the last line of my extract.  this
is plainly silly.  either put the comment marker back, or remove the

I got it. "silly" error, alright: A line

Then maybe you can help me. As I wrote I want
the index of the footnote to be normal text.
I tried to replace the \textsuperscript with
\textnormal in the following to obtain that
effect? (I am just guessing):
 
\else
        \ifdim\footnotemargin=0pt
          \llap{\textsuperscript{\@thefnmark}}%
        \else
          \llap{\hb@xt@
-\footnotemargin{\textsuperscript{\@thefnmark}\hss}}%
        \fi
      \fi

But that didn't work. I have programming
experience but it is the first time I try to
make changes in Latex and find it a bit
confusing just now.
Thank you beforehand

Well, after all the discussion, I find that the NIST site
http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/bigOnotation.html
asserts that, for Big-O,
"Strictly, the character is the upper-case Greek letter Omicron,
not the letter O, but who can tell the difference?"
and, for the little-o,
"Strictly, the character is the lower-case Greek letter omicron"
and since these are not defined separately from O and o in the Greek symbols
in LaTeX, I guess one simply should use $O(x^p)$ and $o(x^p)$.
Sorry for provoking all the discussion over nothing, although I learned
several useful things, for which I thank you all.

that's actually just wrong.  \@Alph\c@chapter (etc) or \Alph{chapter}

also, it doesn't quite work: numbering will go A1 A2 A3 B4 B5 C6 ...

and \@addtoreset isn't useful either -- the default version would make
the first page of each appendix number 0.

these issues are addressed in chappg.sty (which is in my old tetex
system, so i guess is generally available; otherwise ctan
macros/latex/contrib/misc/chappg.sty) 

to use it for the present purpose (rather than to copy concepts out of
the file):

\usepackage{chappg}
\renewcommand\chappgsep{}
\pagenumbering{arabic} % for the body of the document

...

\appendix
\pagenumbering{bychapter}

however, there's all sorts of whizzies that you might like to
investigate.

To avoid the \makeatletter ... \makeatother pair (and to follow standard

    \renewcommand{\thepage}{\Alph{chapter}\arabic{page}}

What about manually setting the page counter to 1 after every appendix head:

\setcounter{page}{1}

or redefining the \chapter command (after the \appendix has been issued!) to
do it automatically?

what may be confusing you is that you can only have one line spacing
in any given paragraph -- see
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=paraparam
and read \linspread{...} for \raggedright in the examples

no, it works per paragraph, but you have to change font to pick it up.
until latex goes through the business of selecting a new font (i.e.,
something different from what's currently selected -- when it spots
you're asking for the "same font" it "knows" it's got nothing to do)
it just doesn't notice a change in linespread.

[this isn't terribly clever, but then linespread is a pretty
off-the-wall thing to do, anyway.  as you suggest, best done before
\begin{document} for the whole document; but there are ways of getting
changes right -- notably the code of setspace.sty]

I don't know how this is done in LaTeX, but if you can design some
zero-width rules that give you the required interline spacing (this assumes
that you want more, rather than less space somewhere in the paragraph) and
insert them at the right points, which you will determine by looking
at the line-breaks on a first run, you get the effect of adjustable
space in the bounds of a paragraph.  (\lineskip takes over, so you may
want to look at the values set for that.)  I used this technique
to insert Hieroglyphs and short runs of Arabic on several occasions.  

The proportions of height to depth in such a rule (strut) are sometimes
surprising.  There is no very good way of automating the choice which
depends for visual effect on the relation between ascenders and descenders
in the underlying font.

i do, somewhere.

he asked me to look after his packages for him.  if you want to make

Subject: [texhax] On the proper look of the \AA
Message-ID: <eyznco2e26.fsf@video.uic.vsu.ru>

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted to comp.text.tex as well.

Greetings,

there have been some discussion on the CyrTeX-ru mailing list about
the proper appearance of the glyphs representing the ANGSTROM SIGN
(U+212B) and the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5).

When the font encoding contains the pre-built glyph(s) angstrom and
Aring, there is basically no question - the decision on the proper
look of these glyphs is under font designer's control. However, when
the font encoding doesn't contain the pre-built glyph, TeX can
construct it using the glyphs for LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A and the RING
ACCENT which are often available.

For example, the T1 font encoding contains Aring; but OT1 font
encoding doesn't; so TeX can construct this glyph from A and ring.

It is possible to just apply the ring accent to the letter A using the
\accent command; but for some reason Donald Knuth decided to make the
special command \AA to generate the Aring, which puts the ring accent
close to the letter A (without a gap). Similar approach is used in
LaTeX, which defines a \DeclareTextCompositeCommand for the
combination "\r A" in ot1enc.def and ot4enc.def.

Note that Jorg Knappen's EC fonts (T1 encoding) which contain the
pre-built Aring glyph, put the ring close to A (without the gap), so
the Aring looks exactly the same as \AA when constructed artificially
when using the OT1 font encoding (CM fonts).

I noticed that not only CM fonts use "gap-less" Aring, -- various other
fonts (not TeX-related) contain "gap-less" Aring; while some other
fonts treat Aring as A with the ring accent, and put the ring just
like other accents.

To see the difference of both variants, you can process this LaTeX file:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}

\AA % default appearance
% undefine the special \r{A} composite definition:
\expandafter\let\csname \string\T1\string\r-A\endcsname\relax
\AA % using just \accent

\end{document}

Some arguments for the special look of Aring (which I share):

1) D.Knuth defined a special command for \AA, which puts ring close to
   A instead of using \accent

2) the same approach is used in LaTeX in ot1enc.def and ot4enc.def,
   and LaTeX has in mind not only the CM fonts, but any font families,
   so these definitions are meant to be applied not only to CM fonts.

3) The fontinst package contains some code to put the ring close to A
   (the glyph ringfitted defined in latin.mtx, and used in ot1.etx).
   (and this package is meant to be used for installation of "arbitrary"
   fonts)

4) the article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5 in the Online
   Encyclopedia states that:

  The letter "\r{A}" is often perceived as an "A" with a ring,
  interpreting the ring as a diacritic mark. However, the ring is not a
  diacritic. Rather, the letter developed as a form of semi-ligature of
  two consecutive "A"s.

   so this gives some basis to think that ring might be located not as
   plain accent, but closer to A.

5) my memories about the look of the Angstrom sign in the books
   suggest that it should be written as plain TeX does it.

Arguments against the close placement of the ring (from Alexander
Lebedev and Lars Engebretsen) state that from aesthetic reasons the
ring should be put on the same height as other accents. E.g., the
Bitstream specification for developers of new fonts contains an
example of Aring on page 5 and an example of accents on page 4:
http://www.bitstream.com/categories/products/nfc/NFCSubmissions.pdf

I have some questions to experts:

1) what was the rationale to use the special definition of \AA - why
   not just use the \accent to put the ring over A?

2) is this rationale only a design decision of the Computer Modern
   fonts, or it can be applied to other font families? I.e., shall the
   ring in the Aring glyph be put with a gap of the same widths as all
   other accents, or it is preferred to use "gap-less" Aring?

3) should the glyphs for the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE
   and the ANGSTROM SIGN be the same in respect of the placement of
   the ring above A? (I.e., maybe the ring over A in U+00C5 should be
   put as an accent; but the preferred placement of the ring over A in
   the angstrom sign U+212B is without the gap).

Many thanks in advance for your comments.

Best,
v.

The bad looking file produced by pdftex will print just fine.
If you need a better look on screen, you have to tell pdftex to download
type1 (vectorial - resolution independent) fonts in the pdf file.
To do this, you need the postscript type1 font outlines files (.pfb files)
and you have to edit the pdftex font map adding the entries for those font
files (I don't know TeXLive, but in other LaTeX distribution pdftex is
natively set up this way).

If you are completely unaware of what I'm talking about , and if you have
dvips and ps2pdf, you could try this (assuming that you are using standard
Computer Modern fonts with OT1 encoding):

latex myfile.tex
dvips -Ppdf -o myfile.ps myfile.dvi
ps2pdf myfile.ps

Vladimir Volovich asks about the appearance of the
Aring, where exactly the ring should be placed in
relation to the A -- like other accents, or closer
to the A without a gap.

One of the principal models used by Knuth in deciding
on the appearance of various things for TeX was the
Swedish journal "Acta Mathematica".  I assume (though
I don't have first-hand experience) that the Aring
was not uncommon in its pages, and Knuth followed
that model.  Someone who has access to old issues
(from the days when it was set from metal type) could
check the appearance of the Aring there.

First, thank you to Fairbairns and everyone 
else for quick response and valuable advice. 
It is very much appreciated.
Now, I am trying to alter the pagenumbering 
using fancyhdr.sty. I do the following:

\usepackage{fancyhdr}

\pagestyle{fancy}
..
\textwidth=103mm
\textheight=177mm
\fancyfoot[LE,RO]{\bfseries\thepage}

put get two indices of the page number on 
every page. That is, I get one in the middle 
and on the right/left. Also, the fancy head 
is a line wider than the text. In the docs 
this is described as a feature, but is it 
poosible to change it to the width of the 
text?
Maybe, I ought to use a different package to 
get the page numbering to "the side" instead 
of in the middle. I don't know.
Thank you

agreed; BTW maybe the t1.etx should also use the ringfitted: it will
not cause any harm, when applied as an accent, and will "survive" the
trick too (though this trick is not used in T1 encoding); e.g. EC fonts
have ring's width equal to the width of A.

is it "desired" that the ring touches the A?

note that the design of the ring accent in the EC fonts as a separate
glyph and the ring used in Aring is somewhat different: the ring in
Aring is "the real ring", while the ring accent is really an ellipse;
but it looks like the height of Aring pre-built glyph and A with the
ring accent (using \accent) is the same (as can be seen from the latex
example i posted in my original message). This is not so in CM fonts:
the "artificial" aring has smaller height and ring looks closer to A
than in other accented letters.

so the questions are:

1) is it acceptable/desirable to have the ring in Aring placed closer
   to A than in other accented letters?

2) shall the artificial accent placement be applied to other combinations
   of capital letters and accents on the level of encoding definition
   files?

3) you wrote: "Vertically centering them both on the same axis may
   well result in the ring touching the A" - but what i'd like to know

     (I don't know TeXLive, but in other LaTeX distribution pdftex is
    natively set up this way).

It is true in TL as well. Not just for pdftex, but for all the TeX
programs, the outline versions of Computer Modern are used by default.
This has been the case for several years (not sure exactly when).

dvipdfm and pdflatex getting different output makes me think that
perhaps the pdflatex map file isn't right ... just a guess.

Lars,

thank you for your comments. Let me ask your opinion on the practical
question which was the source of my initial inquiry.

The question is: if you were designing a new[1] LaTeX2e encoding
definition file for some font encoding which contained all Latin
letters and the ring accent, BUT NOT the Aring letter, would you put
the special definition of \DeclareTextCompositeCommand for the
combination "\r A" which is the same as the one present in ot1enc.def,
or you would rather remove it, and let the "\r A" be constructed like
other accented letters? E.g. the cyrillic T2* font encodings contain
the Latin latters and the ring accent, and e.g. t2aenc.def contains
the same \DeclareTextCompositeCommand as in ot1enc.def. Was is the
right thing to do to put this composite command into the encoding
definition files?

This question should be considered having in mind that the default
font family would be Computer Modern, but that it should NOT be
concentrated only on the CM family, but try to "do the best thing" for
other font families which might be used with this font encoding.[2]

Would your answer differ if there was no compatibility issue with CM
font family? i.e. if there were no CM-like fonts for that font
encoding, and only "arbiotrary" font families would be used?

Thank you.

===== start footnotes =====
[1] new, so it would be possible to completely ignore the
backward-compatibility issues (including ones with Plain TeX),
i.e. considering purely the "right thing to do". Obviously, changing
an existing file for a along established and stable font encoding like
OT1 is not an option.

[2] that means that the gap between A and ring in \r{A} will be
smaller than the gap between other accents and other letters. would
THAT be acceptable?

i meant that the \accent command places accents using the same "gap"
for uppercase and lowercase letters (is this so?); so i was asking,
are you proposing that commands like \" \' \` shall be redefined to
behave differently if they are applied to capital letters, i.e.use
some trick similar to the one used in the definition of \AA in plain
TeX or \r{A} composite command, to make the gap smaller.

I think you should put \fancyhf{} before the \fancyfoot{}

Play with the \headwidth length, and you should be able to change

As a followup to the question I asked yesterday and trying to understand
what Luca Turchetti said, I looked closely at the log file.  The crucial
file seems to be the file pdftex.map.  When I searched, there were two
copies of this file, one in the directory
c:/TeXLive8/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/
and the second in
c:/TeXLive8/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/
The first one consists of 5180 lines and the second of one three line
comment to the effect that one must not try to edit it, but run updmap.
I tried running updmap, but it couldn't find updmap.cfg (which also
exists, also once in each tree, but evidently this utility doesn't use
kpathsea).  Rather than try to sort out the syntax of how to tell the
prgram where the configuration file was and trying to guess which tree
it would work on, I simply copied the large map file to the other one.
But this whole episode is bizarre.  Why is there so much duplication on
these two trees and how does the TeX engine decide which tree to follow.
It is not in ls-r since each tree has its own copy.  Although I think I
understand TeX reasonably well, I don't know a thing about how the whole
package operates.

This is a real mystery.  Having finally worked out how to generate a
good looking version of a file called abcat.tex (which contained a dozen
or so pages of text, followed by 180 pdf pages), I was now attempting to
make a 2up version, something that I had done numerous times with the
version that looked poor on the screen.  The entire file was this:

 \documentclass{article}
 \usepackage[final]{pdfpages}
\usepackage[letterpaper,landscape,margin=.5in]{geometry}
 \begin{document}
 \includepdf[pages=-,openright,nup=2,delta=.5in 0]{abcat.pdf}
 \end{document}

You will see that it sets no text at all.  To my great surprise, it now
won't compile because it says it cannot find the fonts.  Now the file
abcat.tex actually uses fonts, but this one doesn't.  The first error
message was

found.
\@EveryShipout@Output ...@Org@Shipout \box \@cclv

l.5 ...=-,openright,nup=2,delta=.5in 0]{abcat.pdf}

When I ran it in non-stop mode, there were many more messages like that.
The resultant pdf file would not load in the Adobe reader.  What is
going on here.  And why did the file that used fonts run fine, while
this one that doesn't gets hung up here?

It _could_ be as follows: You have typeset the original, say with a TFM
font aiwhatever10, and with a pdftex.map (extract) about this:

aiwhatever10 <aiwhatever.pfb
aicmsl10 AICMSL <aicmsl10.pfb

Then the aiwhatever.pfb is embedded in your original PDF file abcat.pdf.
Now you include file abcat.pdf by pdfpages. The following happens:
Pdftex always checks the BaseName entry of any font from a loaded file
(abcat.pdf) against the psname entry (2nd field) in pdftex.map - this
field DOES matter in this case: Your aiwhatever.pfb font file happens to
have a BaseName of e. g. AICMSL, or some name, which you find on the
mapfile line starting with the faulty tfm entry aicmsl10 (which you
didn't use for typesetting the original; otherwise it would have crashed
already earlier). Then pdftex tries to replace the font aiwhatever.pfb
coming with the file abcat.pdf by a fresh version, in this case
aicmsl10, where the TFM file is not available by some reason.

If it is like this, you might get rid of this problem, if you look up
the pdftex.map line starting with aicmsl10, and testwise change the 2nd
field to something else, or you remove it. (If the described scenario is
the crash reason, a new pdftex patch would prevent this situation in a
future pdftex release).

There need not be any TFM font in the _original_ starting with ai, it
can happen with any TFM font. The problem is that there is some (Type1)
font embedded in your original, which happens to have a BaseName fitting
to the 2nd field of the aicmsl10 entry in your pdftex.map.

Just look into your pdftex.map. You really should find an aicmsl10 entry
there. Then change/remove the 2nd field.

so to the font aicmsl10 (pdftex uses aicmsl10.tfm/.vf) belongs the
encoding file aicmtext.enc (mapping of TeX letters to Type1 font
characters) and the cmsl10.pfb will be loaded. The things in quotes are

Somehow you have registered a bunch of fonts, e. g. by updmap --enable
Map ai.map, which divert your fonts of embedded files. Find this ai.map
or whatever the mapfile name is, which contains these silly entries, and
disable all these map entries together by updmap --disable ai.map, or
whatever name.

Ok, it just means, you made your original with cmsl10/CMSL10, using the
mapfile line starting with cmsl10, which is a standard entry. The font
cmsl10.pfb (BaseName CMSL10) is used in the original. During embedding,
the CMSL10 line matches the exotic font line aicmsl10/CMSL10. Bang.

This is mostly because the (implicit) definition of the OT1 encoding made
in ot1enc.def, since the definition of the OT1 \r{A} (\AA is obsolete
notation in LaTeX) assumes that the width of the ring glyph is equal to
that of the A glyph. In other words, this is effect, not cause.

I don't think this historical aspect is particularly relevant. It is true
that the ring in \r{a} isn't linguistically a diacritical mark, but neither
are (in Swedish) the dots in \"{a} and \"{o}. \r{a}, \"{a}, and \"{o} are
three last letters in the Swedish alphabet, not mere variations on a and o.

Trivia information: The Swedish alphabet has 28 letters (V and W are
considered equivalent, so A-Z are 25 letters), 9 of which are vowels (a, o,
u, \r{a} are classified as "hard", e, i, y, \"{a}, \"{o} are classified as
"soft"). We really need that many vowels too, because there are 18 distinct
vowel sounds in Swedish.

This might actually be the reason to _make_ it touch the A. Recall that
accents over capitals are usually quite close to the letter (closer than in
the case of lower case letters). Also note that the height of the ring in
many fonts is significantly larger than that of the dieresis. Vertically
centering them both on the same axis may well result in the ring touching
the A.

Within the TeX world, the reason is that Knuth did it this way. I would
look in Computers and Typesetting Vol. A (TeXbook) or Vol. E (CM typefaces)
for the rationale.

This is probably nothing CM-specific.

I see no reason for making them different in this respect. The ANGSTROM

Being currently stationed at the Institut Mittag-Leffler :-), I feel
obliged to check Barbara's conjecture. Looking through some randomly
selected volumes of Acta, I haven't been able to spot a single \r{A} in
there. In retrospect, this isn't particularly surprising; Acta has always
been a very international journal. (Some of its early popularity came from
the fact that it was neither a French nor a German journal, thus being
universally acceptable amongst both authors and subscribers.) Text is
generally in French, German, or (nowadays mostly) English---neither of
which languages use \r{A}. Hence the only likely source of that letter
would be a name, but \r{a} isn't that common a letter in names, and I found
none as an initial. I did however find a \textsc{\r{a}}, where the ring is
close to, but does not touch, the \textsc{a}.

Still, there is a good chance that an \r{A} in the journal would have had
the ring joined to the A. In the (far less prestigous) sister journal
"Arkiv f?r matematik", which is also published by the institute and (at
least in the lead era) was printed by the same printer as the Acta, I did
manage to find an "\r{A}ke", and there the ring was joined to the A.

Thus in summary: It is possible, although rather unlikely, that Knuth saw
such an \r{A} in the Acta mathematica.

I would look odd if the character was produced in isolation, though. I
believe \r{} is perfectly legal LaTeX (even though I cannot see why one
would want to write it), and in that case the width of A would look wrong
(especially in comparison with other accents in isolation).

It would simply be a consequence of other aspects (height of capitals,
position of "accent axis", thickness of lines, ...) of the font design.
Probably nothing that one would strive for from the start, but certainly an
acceptable way of handling geometrical realities.

This is probably not only an issue with Aring. You might also want to
compare e.g. \"{O} and \"{\empty O} (the \empty defeats the
composite-lookup mechanism in LaTeX, so that it defaults to the definition
via \accent). I'm pretty sure that the dots won't be in the same position
there either.

Capital accents are different from lower case accents. The loose accents in
OT1 and T1 fonts are lower case accents. Using the placement of the latter
as a rule is probably not a good idea. fontinst could also do better in
that department.

? Please clarify.

Gap and no gap are typographically equivalent. As I wrote above, it
probably depends on how other aspects of the font design works out whether
there in the end will be a gap or not.

Some fonts have both a gap and a touching position of the ring. They manage
this by cutting out a bit of the top of the A, as if there was a circular
margin around the ring.

No, I mean it is probably up to the font designer to decide which looks best.

Dear Sir or Madam:

   My name is Katherine Northrup and I am an undergraduate student at
Ursinus College (near Philadelphia, PA) writing in LaTeX for the first time.
I must say I'm very pleased with the appearance of my output and the ease of
writing in LaTeX, with the exception of one detail that I hope you can help
with.

  I'm writing a translation of an ancient astronomical text (Aristarchus of
Samos) and I'm trying to put a rounded over line over the groups of letters
that represent semicircles and arcs in the text.  I know about \overline for
the straight lines to denote line segments; I'd like to mark the arcs
accordingly.  My instructor found the \arc command 
\newcommand{\arc}[1]{\ensuremath{\stackrel{\displaystyle{\frown}}{#1}}} 
which invokes the frown and the stack function, but this really doesn't look
very good at all, especially over more than 2 characters (and I mostly need
it over 3).

  I'm hoping there is a simple way to do this; surely enough geometers write
in LaTeX that there might be.  I'd appreciate any advice at all about this
matter.  If you don't know of a way to do so, could you please put me into
contact with someone who might, or else suggest a search I might try on CTAN
that would show me documents that might contain such a symbol?

Thank you very much for your time and consideration of this matter.  I'm
very grateful.

Sincerely,

I would probably drop that special definition. It introduces some rather
odd extra conditions on the font, without giving anything in return for the
indended target audience.

I don't think the "size of the gap" is a relevant parameter here. My
impression is rather that accents sit on an axis---the exact position of
which has to depend on the height of the base character, but we can ignore
that here since capitals are fairly even---and it is the position of this
axis that needs to be consistent. I furthermore feel that some accents
(dieresis, dotaccent, ring) should be centered on this axis, whereas others
(accute, grave) are better off with the lower end on the axis. Since the
ring is larger than the dotaccent, this makes it necessary that the gap
between ring and letter is smaller than that between a dotaccent and the
letter.

But of course the gap must not be smaller than the negative of the line
width of the ring (meaning: if the A sticks up inside the ring, then the
ring is too low). This is probably the only placement that is absolutely
wrong.

No. I wouldn't require a <some-new-encoding> member of the CM family to
follow the OT1 behaviour in that respect.

Aha. I was rather thinking about what a font designer would do.

Actually, as a general rule I would think that _if_ the author of a new
font encoding includes some trick like the

\DeclareTextCompositeCommand{\r}{OT1}{A}
   {\leavevmode\setbox\z@\hbox{h}\dimen@\ht\z@\advance\dimen@-1ex%
    \rlap{\raise.67\dimen@\hbox{\char23}}A}

of OT1, then he should design this trick so that it can work for arbitrary
font designs. The only way to accomplish that is probably to store the
vertical distance by which the ring should be adjusted in a \fontdimen, but
that is fine. It is anyway the responsibility of the encoding author to
define the fontdimens (beyond those which are hardwired into TeX) and the
only practical bound on the number of fontdimens in a font is the bound on
the total size of the TFM file.

You seem to be ignoring comments from other people (Lars Hellstr?m and
Harald Hanche-Olsen) who have some other experience.

I'm not arguing against this statement: the design of all glyphs,
including the Aring glyph, is dependent only on the style of the whole
font and its aspects.

We are discussing the case when there is NO Aring glyph in the LaTeX
font encoding, such as OT1 or T2A font encoding.

In this case, we HAVE TO construct the Aring glyph "artificially", and
we have two ways of doing that: either just apply the ring to A using
an \accent command, or put the ring closer to A using the approach
currently used in ot1enc.def.

There are valid arguments to do the latter, as Lars Hellstr?m and
Harald Hanche-Olsen pointed out.

May it be the result of incorrect metric for A and/or ring glyphs?

Do you have a complete list of "other fonts"? Wouldn't it look ugly if
we were dependant on font families in the generic encoding definition
files?

I see no way to do that properly.

Remember, we are discussing the case when the font encoding does not
contain the pre-built Aring glyph (in case it does contain that glyph,
it's appearance is in the hands of font designer).

Best,

you mean that e.g. to achieve the "gapless Aring" using the \accent
command, it would be possible to put the ring accent somewhat lower?
are you sure that this approach will work properly for both small and
capital letters?

(If it would be possible to do that, i wonder then why Don Knuth
didn't use this approach when he wanted to create a special look for
the Aring glyph. And why did he decide to make Aring a special case in
the first place)

No, i meant that it's impossible to gather the complete list of font
families to which such trick with composite command should be applied;
and the encoding definition file is definitely not the proper place to
put all such low-level stuff which deals with font families.

I.e. either this trick shall be used for all families (including CM)
or not used at all.

again, i mean that i see no way to properly do what you have
suggested: i.e. to restrict the application of the special definition
of \r{A} only to CM and CM-related fonts.

it can be left there more or less like it is now, or it shall be
removed. then, \r{A} in T2A encoded CM fonts (LH fonts) will look
differently from \r{A} in OT1 encoded CM fonts.

the definition is somewhat more complex - see the definition. (and
recently, it has been corrected in plain TeX and in LaTeX to use "!"
instead of "h").

ok - as i've seen some comments from Lars Hellstr?m where he says that
he wouldn't have used this trick as "it introduces some rather odd

completely (even for cmr family of LH fonts)...  after all, this IS a
hack, and to get the proper appearance of \r{A} it is better not to

You have ignored one detail: for these fonts the designer can construct
the ring and other accents and PLACE THEM AT THE PROPER HEIGHT in order
to have their appearance in all composed glyphs as best as possible.
BTW, it's a common principle for font designers.

No, the metric of all glyphs was corrected.

I didn't check all the fonts from the PSCyr collection yet.  I'll do it in
a few days.

The ugly position of the ring in composed Aring was surprising to me too.
I think this can be the result of different A letter and the ring sizes in
different fonts (bolder fonts need larger accents).  BTW, the A letter
in AntiquaPSCyr is about 5% higher then the CapHeight and it cannot be lower
because of the font style.  In bold variant of the font the ring in composed
Aring looks better because the A letter in this font is lower.  I guess
the special algorithm under discussion uses the CapHeight instead of the
proper letter height.

I spent the weekend browsing through my bookshelves, looking particularly
at Norwegian books printed before 1960. I found that in about 80% of the
typefaces the ring was connected to the A, so this seems to have been the
dominant custom when printing the ?.

    Can anyone recommend a book on Latex. I know 

Well, there's the original:
LaTeX: A Document Preparation System, by Leslie Lamport (Addison-Wesley,
ISBN 0-201-52983-1, 1994). Covers core LaTeX.

And this:
A Guide to LaTeX2e, by Helmut Kopka and Patrick Daly (Addison-Wesley,
ISBN 0-201-39825-7, 1999). Also covers core LaTeX from the ground up,
and also discusses commonly used packages for graphics, web integration,
and more.

And this:
The LaTeX Companion, by Michel Goossens, Frank Mittelbach and Alexander
Samarin (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-54199-8).
(There are other Companion books covering graphics and web topics.)

There's a new edition of the Companion in production now, and the 4th
edition of the Guide just came out.


Although not hardbound "books", you might also be interested in these
(freely available) documents:

The not so Short Introduction to LaTeX2e, by Tobias Oetiker (pdf, ps,
in many languages).

Far be it from me to dissuade anyone from buying a book (and reading it!),
but don't forget that there is a mine of information in the guides and
documentation that are contained, e.g., in the MiKTeX installation.  There
is also Robin Fairbairns' pretty exhaustive FAQ, which is always worth
consulting before embarking on an attempt to "solve" a LaTeX problem.

Anyway, Lamport's book is pretty good fare for a would-be LaTeXer while a
would-be [La]TeXhacker might find Schwarz's Introduction to TeX useful to
understand the inner workings of TeX in general and start writing macros.

I guessed that one could put a ~ between the tables AND IT WORKED! 
More than one spreads it more ... If there are spaces between them
there is more space ...

That's what laptops and pen tablets are for --- I've got all the refs 
Robin mentioned on my Fujitsu Stylistic and they're quite as easy to 
read on it as on paper, and _much_ easier to store, carry and find.

Have you typeset source2e? There's not much else which'll teach you 
more (if one can only get to the point where on can understand what's 
in it --- anyone have a bare minimum list of texts / concepts one would 
need to understand before plunging in?)

Quite simply, the line that reads

\vspace{2cm}

should be changed to

\hspace{2cm}

Note that \vspace is inoperative inside paragraphs and in any case "v"
stands for vertical while "h" for horizontal.

Putting \hspace*{2cm} before the first table will indent it by 2cm (the *
forces LaTeX not to ignore the space, as it would normally at the start or
end of a line).

Have a look at

...\doc\latex\help\latex2e.chm

and choose \vspace, \hspace.

Or try Sec 6.3.3 in lshort.dvi (The not so short....).

How do I embolden Greek symbols when doing equations. The $\mathbf{\beta}$
does not change beta from italics to bold. The same problem remains in
equation environment (\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}).

I'm sure it's something simple but I can't find it in any of my Latex
books.

Check the online FAQ (http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html). One of
the entries is "Setting bold Greek letters in LaTeX". In a nutshell, there
are three methods: using the \boldmath command, the bm package, or the
AMS amsbsy package.

Hope this helps (and you also found a new place to get answers),

source2e is a thing in the latex distribution which formats to provide a
readable listing of the source, with comments where appropriate.

if you know enough tex (i.e., the basic primitives and what they do)
source2e is a very enlightening thing.  if you don't, or are easily
frightened, source2e is a pretty overwhelming object.

unless you're already a tex hacker, i would not really recommend
source2e.

Sounds exciting, but I think I will just buy the book :)

Well, I am definitely not a tex hacker -- or any other kind of hacker, for that
matter -- but I am equally not easy to scare. That is, I don't like horror
movies, but code and programming seems to take me through a pipeline of wonder,
frustration, understanding, happiness, and finally boredom -- which is when I
find new things to learn; and then I return when I forget about the last station
on the assembly line.

                           Practical TeX 2004

     Workshops and Presentations on LaTeX, TeX, AMS-LaTeX, and more

             San Francisco, California    July 19-22, 2004

                    http://tug.org/practicaltex2004

======================================================================

INTRODUCTION
------------
Practical TeX 2004 is a conference focused on the use of LaTeX,
AMS-LaTeX, and ConTeXt.  LaTeX and all of the TeX family of programs are
often seen as a difficult and specialized tool set requiring a fair
amount of training, but the truth is that it's surprisingly easy to get
superior results from a relatively small set of basic functions.

Practical TeX 2004 follows on the success of the 1998 TeX NorthEast
user-oriented conference held in New York City.  This year's conference
will include presentations and workshops aimed at the beginning,
intermediate and professional use of LaTeX, AMS-LaTeX, and ConTeXt.
Participants will have the opportunity to expand their appreciation for
how these systems offer efficient and compelling solutions to complex
publishing requirements.

The TeX Users Group (TUG) was founded in 1980 for support and
development of TeX in all its flavors.  TUG holds annual conferences
which address all aspects of TeX, including implementation and
development issues, and collaborates with the many other TeX user
groups worldwide on many projects.  See the TUG home page at
http://www.tug.org for more information.


CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------
This three-day conference will have user-oriented presentations and
workshops on LaTeX, TeX, and AMS-LaTeX and their use in document
production.  The conference will take place at the Holiday Inn
Fisherman's Wharf hotel in San Francisco, California, USA.  Registration
and reservations can be made any time at the conference web site,
http://tug.org/practicaltex2004.


If you would like to present a paper or hold a workshop, please send an
abstract (plain ASCII is fine, or any TeX format) to
conferences@tug.org.  Topics including but not limited to:

- Production for the Web - HTML/XML/MathML and TeX
- PDF and TeX
- Including graphics files and other pictures in documents
- Practices for structuring documents
- Real-world style design
- University publishing
- Commercial publishing
- Experiences teaching LaTeX, AMS-LaTeX, and ConTeXt in 
  university or commercial settings
- TeX Live, MikTeX, VTEX, and other TeX installations
- Cross-platform issues
- Multilingual typesetting
- Any other aspect of practical TeX usage

We welcome presentations relating to LaTeX, AMS-LaTeX, ConTeXt, plain
TeX, or any other major format.


IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
March 15   - abstracts due
April 30   - draft paper due (so we can review and return comments)
June 15    - preprint paper due (so we can distribute at the conference)
July 19-21 - conference days
July 22    - post-conference workshop day

The proceedings will be published in TUGboat, after the conference.


SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES
-------------------------
If your organization would like to sponsor the conference, numerous
options are available, from a straight cash donation (always welcome :)
to logos on the conference memorabilia.  Please see
http://tug.org/practicaltex2004/sponsor.html



For registration fees, hotel reservations, a publicity flyer (please
post!) and more, please see:

Message-ID: <000901c3e225$dfe303d0$58a02444@bob>

   I am in the process of writing a paper, which I hope I can publish. In
this paper, I have Lemmas and proofs. I understand that LaTeX has the
\newtheorem
command which is suppose to make my life easy. However, I am badly confused
on how it works. Here are my questions?
     1) Should I be using it at all?
     2) Should I be using it in the document are in the preamble?
     3) I want to include proofs of my Lemmas. Can this command handle
         this.

I want to thank the group for its previous responds to my questions. I think
this group has been very helpful and  there are a lot of fine people here.

The tool you want is BibTeX.  It's covered in the LaTeX Companion, and
you can search for it online.

Message-ID: <20040125144835.98491.qmail@web12407.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,
    My new book's edition has an average of five
footnotes per page, so I has a problem like one
footnote reference is on page 84 but its footnote text
is on the bottom of page 85.
    It would be very appreciated if you could please
suggest me how to fix such problem of footnote. I've
tried to search for some footnote packages to fix this
problem but none is the right to my problem, so If
there is no packages to correct this problem, could
you please suggest me how to correct it by myself?
 
                                         Best regards,
                                     chakrit  nimmanant

An average of five footnotes per page suggests a pretty random style,
but anyway . . .

Try increasing \footskip:
	
	\addtolength{\footskip}{<dimen>}
	
	or use the package geometry.

Hi,
 If all your pages have 4-5 footnotes then you should can either increase
the footer area of all the pages using geometry package, or you can
consider changing your footnotes to endnotes so that they are at the end
of the chapter. I think that there is a package 'endnotes' that does it,
but I have never tried it.

Robert:  Although Bibtex does help one to put together a bibliography
it is not essential to go down this route since ordinary laTeX commands
will do the job just as effectively particularly for a one-off paper as eg

\begin{thebibliography}[99]
\bibitem{abc03} Author, A., J. Irreproducible Results, 56:345--56, 
\textbf{2003}.
......
\end{thebibliography}

I find that dedicated bibliographic tools such as Endnote are the best for 
importing
data from online sources such as Web of Science, Chemical Abstracts, etc
and maintaining an in-house library of references which can then be pasted 
into a
LaTeX document in the desired format.

Hello TeXperts,

I would like to know how I can include the graphic files from other 
directories. I have gone through the TeXFAQ and could not really figure 
out how
\graphicspath works. If any one know how this can be implemented, kindly 
let me know. Further, if there are any other alternative methods to 
include files (more efficient and faster), then please let me know.

I work, on WinXP, with MikTeX (using LaTeX ) on WinEdt.

Any help is deeply appreciated.

Did you try TeX FAQ in: http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq (Q. 99 in the current
version) ?

Here's an example, note the braces around each entry, also the paths may be
relative or absolute (as in the example):

\graphicspath{{epsfiles1/}{epsfiles2/}{c:/dir1/subdir2/epsfiles3/}}

Note too that it only works with the \includegraphics{...} command and not
others.

You might want to look at Q. 227 from the above too.

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

Hello Philip,

A big thanx.... It worked. Yes I tried the FAQ url. The exact way of 
implementation was not clear when I read the FAQ. At that time, it 
worked for the relative path and I tried, but with out success to 
include the absolute path.

Now everything is clear. And the answer to Q 229. too is very 
informative. Thanx a lot again.

Thanx and have a nice day ahead.

Zach

I have been asked to help out a group of editors who are attempting to put 
together a festschrift and are running into problems because various 
things in the paper clash with each other.  Some of the problems are easy 
to solve.  An error message that \newtheorem{lem}{Lemma} is multiply 
defined can be fixed by either deleting it or simply preceding it with 
\let\lem\relax.  Much more serious are multiply defined labels and bib 
entries.  Have these problems been solved?  I did search ctan for

Hello TeX Wizards,

Recently  I thought of buying a LaTeX book, @ Amzon, I could see a 
handful of titles, But thought I would go for the "Guide to Latex" by 
Kopka and Daly. I have used the third edition of this book and very much 
impressed. I just would like to get the feedback regarding the fourth 
edition if any of have some experience with it, before actually buying it.

Many thanks in advance,

Yes, this does no harm, as the definition is just repeated
  --- unless there is a counter-dependancy with one definition,
but not another.

This is a lot harder, since with a multi-author document
and lots of \include'd files (one for each paper, say),
the .aux files are all read at the same grouping level.
This is where the labels are first encountered.

A technique that I have used is to assign a 'unique prefix'
automatically for each paper, which will work with
  \cite  \bibitem  \label  \ref  etc.  commands.

e.g. conceptually these macros need to be changed so that
           \label{<label>}
  gets interpreted like
            \label{\chapterPrefix <label>}
and similarly in the other cases.

Of course you need to change the expansion of \chapterPrefix for
each chapter/paper  and ensure that it has been fully expanded
when the entry is written to the appropriate  .aux  file.

Programming this is not too hard, requiring only limited use
of some LaTeX internals.


Hope this helps,

	Ross Moore

You might want to look at the natbib package - it doesn't do it
automatically but has, e.g., a \citet* for full name set and just \citet to
truncate - but it also requires a .bib file that might have a slightly
different format to what you have (I'm not too familiar with harvard.sty
though).

If that proves too hard then, with a good editor or even batch programme, it
shouldn't be too hard to do multiple global substitutions in each input file
of the sort:

\label{xxx} -> \label{filename:xxx}

I have a probelm with hyperref and a heavily linked tex document

                [2000/01/22 v6.69c Hypertext links for LaTeX]

Following problem:
When compiling the document (a reference manual with hyperlinks from 
anywhere to anywhere else, and pdf bookmarks down to subsubsection level)
the first time works out all right. The second time it stops with 

! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [pool size=67355].
\label ...trip@prefix \meaning \@currentlabelname

!  ==> Fatal error occurred, the output PDF file not finished!
Transcript written on Reference_book.log.
I can fix this by reducing the size of the document, e.g. excluding some of the \include d documents, but that is not what I need. 

N.B. this does not happen in draft mode.

Question: is there a way to convince hyperref to clean up from time to time, 
like \clearpage does for floats ?

That is quite a small pool size.  Nowadays the default is more like
1,200,000.  You can alter this by changing pool_size in
<texmf>/web2c/texmf.cnf, or setting pool_size in the environment (I
think; not sure if you have to redump .fmt's).

There are several options.

http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~awf/latex-posters/
http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/~wolven/posters.html

However, I have never had the need to make a poster, so I can't say 
which one is best.

Yes, natbib in conjunction with makebst to create an individual bst file is a good solution. The bst file allows you to set truncation limits for author names. Just type

latex makebst

and follow the instructions (if you're on a unix system, that is).

You will have \citet, \citep (for citation in parentheses), \citeauthor and others, but I guess you can batch replace those in your source.

I have written a short step-to-step guideline and some tools how to 
prepare T1 fonts for MiKTeX 2.3 and later from scratch. You can find 
it in on DANTE in the /support/miktex-contrib/fi2t1 subdirectory.

    I am trying to write a paper using LaTeX and BibTex for the
Bibliography. I
understand that I need to create a .bib file, which I have done. I also
understand
that I need a statement like:
    \bibliographstyle{plain}
in the preamble of my document which I have. I also have the statement:
    \bibliography{t1}
in my document. The name of my bib file is t1.bib I do not get a
bibliography just the word References in bold in the LaTeX output. It does
give the following error
message:

        LaTeX Warning: Empty `thebibliography' environment on input line 3.

The file t1.bib has a single entry in it. I am thinking that the problem is
that I
do not have any \cite comments. I feel badly confused. I am hoping somebody
can tell me what I am missing. Also, it would help if somebody could provide
me a simple LaTeX file with a bibliography that does work.

Glinda the good witch told Dorothy she had been carrying the key to
her problem with her all along.  Similarly, you need some citations to
require a bibliography.  The "error" you cite is really just a
warning, I think.  Try citing the one entry in your bibliography (or
use \nocite) and see what happens.

Also keep in mind something that you are probably already doing, but 
that took me a long time to grasp:  you have to run the sequence 
Latex-Bibtex-Latex-Latex on your source file.

A FAQ, see http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq (Q. 235 in the current version):

235 Accented words aren?t hyphenated

TEX?s algorithm for hyphenation gives up when it encounters an \accent
command;
there are good reasons for this, but it means that quality typesetting in
non-English
languages can be difficult.
For TEX macro packages, you can avoiding the effect by using an
appropriately
encoded font (for example, a Cork-encoded font ? see question 43) which
contains
accented letters as single glyphs. LATEX users can achieve this end simply
by adding
the command
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
to the preamble of their document. Other encodings (notably LY1, promoted by
Y&Y ? see question 57) may be used in place of T1. Indeed, most current
8-bit
TEX font encodings will ?work? with the relevant sets of hyphenation
patterns.
In the future, perhaps, Omega (see question 327) will provide a rather
different
solution.

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

it's always a good idea to say what the error actually is.  here's a
fanciful spanish example (i know neither spanish nor portuguese, i'm
afraid):

*\hyphenation{ma-\~na-na}
! Improper \hyphenation will be flushed.
...

however, if i say:

*\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
*\hyphenation{ma-\~na-na}
*\showhyphens{ma\~na-na}
Underfull \hbox (badness 10000) detected at line 0
[] \T1/cmr/m/n/10 ma-ña-na

i.e., activate T1 _before_ setting your hyphenation and all will be ok.
(note i activated babel spanish option to get \righthyphenmin=2).

there ought to be a faq answer for this error, especially since the
solution is so straightforward (in most cases).  there may be one in the
next edition ... if i can finish the job i'm already doing before then.

Message-ID: <200401220014.i0M0E3j11400@sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu>

Dear Sir/Madam:           Wed Jan 21 07:02:36 PM EST 2004
   I am a member of TUG. I have not found an answer to the
following question in the TeXbook or elsewhere:

      Is there a way to set up TeX in such a way as to make
      it break a line anywhere, even inside words, when it
      reaches the end of the line? The practical significance
      of this question is when one types a long URL such as
           http://mathschallenge.net/index.php?section=problems
           &show=true&titleid=factorial_divisibility
      one wants to break the line exactly when one runs out
      of space in the line. Normally, I would use the \tt font
      to type such a URL, but I prefer not to have to set
      the line breaks manually, so that the solution
      would work even if I change \hsize later. I would
      be interested in a solution for TeX or AmSTeX, and
      less so for LaTeX (which I do not use at this point).

                     Sincerely yours,

                     Attila Mate

Try a search under google.com with "latex poster a0" and you should get
at least a 100 pages showing howto. 
All the best,

Hi all,

If I add a word to hyphenation with an accent I get an error. How can I
add one word to hyphenation with accent without problems?

Best regards,

    I am new user. I dont know how to install
    LaTeX,MiKTeX, Ghost view, winEdt etc.

Please see http://tug.org/begin.html for an introduction and a list of
TeX systems to choose from.  It sounds like you're on Windows, so either
fpTeX (http://www.fptex.org) or mikTeX (http://www.miktex.org) is
probably the right thing.

Good luck,
karl

I suggest path.sty, included in Eplain (http://tug.org/eplain) and also
on CTAN (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/path.sty).

Despite the directory location on CTAN, it works with plain TeX and
AMSTeX (as well as LaTeX).

By default, it does not break at any character, but only at certain
punctuation characters.  Usually this is better.  You could configure
it to allow breaking after more chars, if needed.  There's info in the
file itself about how to do this.

Happy line breaking,
karl
