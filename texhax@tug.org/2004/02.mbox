Subject: [texhax] Metafont graphic display under X11
Message-ID: <20040201195009.14062@smtp.numericable.fr>

Hi everybody,

I'm trying to get Metafont's graphic display under X11 (in fact, MacOS X
XDarwin). I have mf Version 2.7182 (Web2C 7.3.8). Looking at my binaries
I get:

-rwxr-xr-x    1 yannis   admin      319312 Nov 20  2002 /usr/TeX/bin/
powerpc-apple-darwin6.2/mf
-rwxr-xr-x    1 yannis   admin      319312 Nov 20  2002 /usr/TeX/bin/
powerpc-apple-darwin6.2/mfw

mf and mfw have exactly the same size. I have compared them using a binary
file editor and found that the only difference between them is that mf,
at location 00049CD0 has the string "mfextra.c" while mfw at that
location has the string "mfnowin.c"
That location seems like an error message or some kind of string pool.

That's all difference there is. No wonder mfw does not display anything,
since it is practically the same program as mf. Shouldn't there by some
kind of call to X libraries? 

So I am asking the question: how, using mfw, do I get graphic display
under X, be it under MacOS X or under Linux?

Thanks in advance for any experience you may have on this issue.

    So I am asking the question: how, using mfw, do I get graphic display

Hi Yannis,

I can't speak to MacOSX, but under GNU/Linux, with DISPLAY set to :0,
mfw works for me (TeX Live 2003, that is, Metafont (Web2C 7.5.2)
2.71828), with one apparent bug: I have to use showit twice the first
time.  After the first showit, the X window is created, but is empty.
After the second showit, the dot appears.

drawdot(10,10); showit; showit;

After that, the normal:
drawdot(20,20); showit;

works for me.

    That location seems like an error message or some kind of string pool.

Those are filenames.  Perhaps the code is checking argv[0] at runtime, I
don't know.  But mf and mfw do behave as intended for me.

I'm cc-ing tex-k since Olaf and Thomas are not on texhax.

HTH,
karl

I did what you said and here is the result:

bash-2.05a$ mfw "&plain testmfw.mf" 
This is METAFONT, Version 2.7182 (Web2C 7.3.8)
(testmfw.mf
mf: Window support for X was not compiled into this binary.
mf: There may be a binary called `mfw' on your system which
mf: does contain X window support.

It's quite funny to read "there may be a binary called `mfw'" while it is
precisely mfw which is running... I think it would be more honest not to
include mfw at all, if it's the same as mf.

If anyone knows about a working mfw under MacOS X please let me know.

I believe this may have been a bug in that release, where window support
didn't work.

They are not intended to be the same.
If they were the same in that release, then that was simply a bug.

Gerben will need to answer that.  Before you said Linux would be ok
too.  Does it work for you on Linux?  Can you try TL2003, instead of the
older version?

Did you post on the TeX on Mac OS X list 
(http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/)? Surely there is someone there who 
has tried it (though not I).

I compiled teTeX 2.0.2 under Mac OS X 10.3 with X11.  `mfw cmr10'
works fine, just like under Linux.

mf and mfw are a same binary.  `mf cmr10' shoud work the same way.

Things that shouldn't change case must be placed in braces:

@ARTICLE{Planner:NP,
 AUTHOR = "L, Stockmeyer",
 TITLE = "Planer 3-colorablilty is {NP}-complete.",
 JOURNAL = "SIGACT",
 YEAR = "1973" }

Also, you ought to insert authors in the following format:

 AUTHOR = "Gonzalez-Verlarde, Jose Luis and Laguna, Manuel",

Most of all, you ought to read btxdoc.dvi, which should be there in your
LaTeX installation somewhere like ...\texmf\doc\bibtex\.

It works as expected with the current teTeX based on Web2C 7.4.5.

In recent versions of teTeX mf is a symlink to mfw and there is an
other binary mf-nowin, which doesn't require a GUI. The latter is
intended to be called from scripts to generate fonts in background.

I recommend to make mf the binary with window support, so that mfw can
be replaced by a script which issues a warning before executing mf.

Then mfw can be removed completely in a few years.  Olaf, what do you
think? 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <1075758849.28082.14.camel@sahp4671.sandia.gov>

I've been using pdflatex lately to create (seminar) presentations that
combine vector graphics (using xfig and other programs) with TeX's
excellent mathematical formatting capabilities.

Still, two things I don't understand well:

(1) I've set my screen size and slide sizes very close to USLetter
landscape (8.5 in high, 11 in wide). But my xfig drawings are limited to
about 3 in high and no more than about 5 in wide. They get magnified
when going through xfig's "Export LaTeX/PDF" and re-imported in
pdflatex! Why? Is seminar or pdflatex redefining my unit of length?

(2) Are there graphicx options or TeX commands to fiddle with the
position after the special graphics object has been inserted?
Preferably, something portable to both pdflatex and latex would be nice.
(Sometimes after inserting a figure I'd prefer to "backup" to the left,
upward, etc.) Is something like \hspace*{-0.5in} and \vspace*{-0.5in}
workable or considered gauche?

Thanks in advance,

i would guess the problem is in the latex produced in your export command.
it sounds as if its \includegraphics command is limiting the width of
the image to half the width, as in

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pdf-file-name}

why export this way?  why not just as pdf, and then write your own
\includegraphics command?

the simple commands are probably workable, but terribly unsatisfactory,
since they involve you in visual placing.  far better to place things on
the "slide" on a designed basis, perhaps using a picture-like
environment.

what slide class are you using?  doesn't it provide placement
facilities?  (the one i use, beamer, does most of the placement
remarkably well, automatically.)

     First, I want to thank the group for their fine responses to my
question on
Bibliography. I found the responses to me very helpful. Now please consider
the following LaTeX fragment:

        $ \bigcup_{x \in S}DF(x)$

In this case, LaTeX is generating the x in S part as a subscript. What I
would like it to do is put it directly under the union symbol. Is there a
way that I can tell
LaTeX to do that. I hope my question is clear.

 $ \bigcup\limits_{x \in S}DF(x)$

something so bulky is going to make your paragraph look very untidy.
far better to put it in a display (and rewrite your words slightly), in
which case the \limits won't be necessary.

Subject: [texhax] iterative construction of matrices - error at insertion of
 alignment characters or end line command
Message-ID: <6.0.0.22.0.20040201131611.01effdc8@popmail.libero.it>



In writings dealing with linear algebra, in which it is continually 
necessary to visualize a lot of matrices of different order, is extremely 
comfortable provide a command that directly create the matrices after 
having declared the number of rows and columns and the name of the elements.
The following code tries to build the bases of such macro; the problem is 
the insertion of the alignment character `&' or end line command `\ 
\'  which causes an error. Anyone can help?
The code:

\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}

\usepackage{amsmath}% for `bmatrix' environment

\newcommand{\TAB}{\&} % should be `&'
\newcommand{\ENDROW}{\backslash\backslash}% should be `\\'

The problem is probably that bmatrix reads the enclosed text looking for &
and \\ BEFORE anything gets expanded.  This makes it rather non-trivial to
interect with such a command.

I'm afraid I don't have any ready-made solution.

I've looked at the TeX snippet that xfig exports and the 
\includegraphics does not use any optional arguments, just the name of
the PDF file. So, whatever scaling is being done is happening somewhere
else, perhaps in the PDF figure itself. I'm vaguely familiar with
PostScript, but not PDF, so it's hard for me to tell if scaling is being
done there.

The idea was to draw a figure and to place LaTeX rendered text on the
figure. Among my sources of inspiration is

http://www.nersc.no/~knutal/xfig_fondling.html

Xfig does a nice job with standard PostScript fonts, but occasionally
it's desirable to put something like a partial differential equation or
boundary condition expression on the figure, and in a particular place,
too. Equations are where TeX excels and plain PostScript font strings
disappoint.

I'm accustomed to repeated previews using acroread or ghostview;
sometimes the "nonlinear" nature of TeX formatting means it is hard to
converge to the best looking result, though.

Seminar by Timothy van Zandt, including seminar.bug from Denis Girou.
I understand it was developed ten years ago before pdflatex and online
presentations were common; I wasn't sure what the current consensus was
on the best LaTeX presentation tools - TeXPower and PPower4 seemed a
little bit on the bleeding edge still.

It's unfortunate in some ways, but being able to predict formatting of
presentations is more important than for printed documents or even for
web pages. 

In some ways I wish I could use xfig as the enveloping environment, but
create arbitrarily placed minipages and parboxes for text and then
export multi-slide presentations to PDF.

I think it's possible to import EPS into xfig, and to use dvips to
create EPS, but I'm not sure that exporting the overall composite slide
to PDF would work well.

I'll take a look at beamer; thanks for the suggestion.

well, quite.  far better to know what you're doing before you start.
hence the suggestions in the faq answer.

i used to use seminar, then had a long hiatus when i didn't need to
produce any presentations.  needing to start up again, i chose beamer.

beamer's about as bleeding edge as you can get, but i find it very
good.  take a look at the manual: it inspired my confidence, and i
wasn't disappointed.

Another way to get (la)tex formatted strings (maths, etc.) onto/into
graphics is to use the tex-to-float plugin which comes with gimp (you
need to have gimp-perl installed). Of course this means you need to use
gimp to mainuplate your graphics, and you end up with a bit map (do it
in large font and then scale down the result to get the desired
resolution).

No need to start a discussion of the relative pros and cons of xfig and
gimp!

Message-ID: <40202564.8030504@csci.csusb.edu>

Greetings.

I have read all of the articles on Type 1 PS fonts I can find on your 
web site and have downloaded (some of) the installation files (e.g., 
AMS, bluesky, etc.).

However, in none of the installation sets can I find a prewritten script
input for the fontinst application.  Although I can write a sed, perl, 
sh, or other script that will list and parse the contents of the 
installation set and then generate a fontinst input script per the 
samples in the Type 1 tutorial that you distribute, this seems to me 
less than economical use of my time (or a students).  Do these
scripte -- or their equivalent for some other equivalent font 
installation utility -- exist for the Type 1 fonts?  If so, where?

Please note that the USA National Science Foundation wants Type 1 fonts
in documents for their FastLane system.  I am using RedHat 9 Linux on a
IA-32 workstation with the standard LaTeX (and Kile and lyx and ... ) 
that is available for such an environment, and that evidently does not 
use Type 1 by default.  Any advice or predone packages greatly would be
appreciated.

In these days with GPL utilities such as configure, it seems rather
slow to need to generate these scripts by hand.

Thanks.

?!?

What's wrong with \usepackage{type1cm}?

Alternately, you could look at Latin Modern (but it doesn't have any 
math support yet).

FWIW, TeXLive and most contemporary / up-to-date distributions use Type 
1 by default. Have you tried getting and installing TeXLive? You should 
probably contact Red Hat if you're using their packaged TeX (which is 
probably woefully out-of-date).

Have you checked the FAQ page on this?

Indeed, this would not be a good use of your time, since there are many
Type 1 CM packages around these days.

For what it's worth, TeX Live and most other distributions have used
Type 1 fonts by default for several years.  The problem is that Red Hat
and other distributions are based on an old (really old) version of
teTeX, before the Type 1's were generally available.  There's nothing we
(the TeX community) can do to change past Linux distributions.

If the mentioned type1cm and other packages mentioned in the FAQ don't
work for you, you might want to install the latest teTeX or TL 2003 and
go from there.

But this is the correct behaviour; figures are numbered according to their
appearance in the text and not according to when they are referenced.  It
would be very odd to have Fig. 10 on page one followed at a later stage by
Fig. 1, 2 etc.  Why on earth should you want such a numbering scheme.  Or
have I misunderstood something?

Perhaps what he wants,  which in fact I also would like, is a treatment
of tables and figures something like bibtex with references.
In other words, something that rearranges the order of figures and tables
to correspond to the order in which they are referenced in the text.

I've thought about this a little and it would seem to require quite a major
rewrite of various parts of LaTeX: \ref, \caption, and the treatment of
floats in general.

What shouldn't be too difficult, however, would be something along the
following lines:

1.  Save each float (figure or table), with NO \begin{figure}...\end{figure}
enclosure and NO \label, in a separate file (only one float per file).  [I
usually do something similar anyway to leave the main file less cluttered.]

2. Define, say,

   \newcommand\FloatRef[3]{\ref{#1}\begin{#3}\input{#2}\label{#1}\end{#3}}

   where, #1 is then the label, #2 is the file name and #3 is the
environment (figure or table).

N.B. This should, of course, be used ONLY ONCE for any given label (the
first reference).  However, with a smidgen more work one could add an
automatic check to see if the given label has already been used (though this
is not entirely trivial!) and thus allow it to always be used.

Any volunteers to write a package?  If I find time (!) and if someone else
adds their name to the would-be users list, maybe I could do something
distributable.

Hi

I wonder if there is any good way to obtain a superscript on the left-hand side 
of a variable in LaTeX. Currently I am using the following hack:

{}^{A}B


A better solution would be very appreciated.

Concerning my questions, I agree that it would be odd to have fig. 10 on page 
1 and fig. 1 on page 2 - I assumed that my \ref{}'s are necessarily infront 
of my figures - well I understood the point and dropped my idea. 

This idea of a new command (bibtex for figures and tables (?)) sounds very 
useful! 
Unfortunately I have neither experiences in writing packages nor in any kind 
of programming, sorry. But I would like to do some testing if that helps.

Somewhere, I'm sure, there is something but I can't put my finger on it
right now.  Anyway, this is certainly a little better as it will respect the
height of the following token:

\newcommand\Prefix[3]{\vphantom{#3}#1#2#3}

usage:

\Prefix^{A}{B} and \Prefix_{A}{B}

Hi.

> do you know if there is a program to convert AMSTeX documents to Latex?

Much of the AmSTeX functionality is provided by the various ams*
packages for LaTeX (amsmath, amssymb, etc.).

The bibliographic stuff can be handled by my ams2bib Perl script,
which can be found on CTAN.  From the README file:

%<------%<--%<--%<---cut here---%<--%<--%<----------------------------

Using ams2bib is very simple:  If you have a file "foo.tex" consisting
of AmSTeX bibliographic references, the command "ams2bib foo" produces
a file "foo.bib" containing the translations of these references into
BibTeX.  Keys are automatically generated, based on the authors' names
and yuear of publication.

Note: AmSTeX does not support the wide variety of reference types that
BibTeX does.  For example, the only way to indicate a technical report
in AmSTeX is to use the \paper reference, with the \paperinfo field
giving the technical report information.  Hence, a tool such as
ams2bib would be hard-pressed to produce a @TechReport bibliographic
entry.  Indeed, ams2bib only produces @Article, @Book, and @InBook
entries.  This means that it may be necessary to hand-edit the
resulting BibTeX file, looking for these kinds of corrections.

%<------%<--%<--%<---cut here---%<--%<--%<----------------------------

At this point, some things still need to be changed by hand, e.g.,
\abstract and \endabstract would need to be changed to
\begin{abstract} and \end{abstract}.  If there's a big demand for
same, I could write a Perl script to do this.

bibtex does the sorting, based on the style you specify in the
\bibliographystyle command. 

for numeric keys, pretty well the only sensible choices[*] you have are
alphabetic sort according to sort key (usually the author names:
plainnat.bst) or sorted according to the order of citation
(unsrtnat.bst).

you want something else, you have to do the ordering yourself, after
bibtex has done the formatting.  get a complete dissertation, get the
point where you could print it, apart from the sorting of the bib.  edit
the file <mythesis>.bbl to change the ordering of the \bibitem entries.
now rerun latex twice.  perform a quick visual check.  print final copy.

[*] of course someone else will know think of another alternative ...
just because i produced this two-element list.

    First, I want to thank the group for their wonderful responses to my
questions
about bibliography. Now, please consider the following LaTeX file:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{pst-node}
\usepackage{amsthm}
\newtheorem{lemma}{Lemma}
\begin{document}
\begin{lemma}
All graphs are colorable
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\par
We have two cases to consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item[Case 1:]
$v_{0}$ and $v_{1}$ were assigned colors in the same call to BFS
In this case, their distance from the root modulus 2 must be the same. In
addition, their distance from the root can differ by no more then one,
from the root. If they are at the same level from the root, then they would
\item[Case 2:]
$v_{0}$ and $v_{1}$ were assigned colors in different calls to BFS
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{document}

Normally, when I use LaTeX for doing proofs, it keeps the left hand margin
straight. In this document, the labels Case 1: and Case 2: are moved into
the left margin.
As a result, my output does not look so good. How can I prevent LaTeX from
doing this.

which works fine in text for 'carbon double bond O' but will not
show the dangling bonds off carbon in your example.

None of the LaTeX packages can handle the geometrical requirements
needed to draw chemical structures properly; all such attempts always
look wrong, so if you have to go beyond Si=Si or C-N then you have
to use what the professionals use.

Most of us use Isis/Draw (freely available) which allows one
to draw virtually any molecule or reaction scheme and which
can then exported as a graphic file back to LaTeX.

You might want to look at chemtool which is libre software. It can found
at:

http://ruby.chemie.uni-freiburg.de/~martin/chemtool/

Isis/draw is 'currently-free-of-charge-no-source-provided' software.

Please, don't get offended, but why didn't you try looking at the manuals

i thought that too.  so i tried it before posting: doesn't work for
left-subscripting _letters_ (what the op is after).  had i read the

Message-ID: <B709BDF1-5A24-11D8-A473-000A95972AFC@otii.com>

Hello,

I am a FrameMaker user that is now switching to Mac OSX. Unfortunately 
Adobe does not support FrameMaker on OS X and is suggesting we move to 
InDesign. However good, InDesign cannot do many FrameMaker functions 
such as footnotes, autoflow of text and paragraphs, or math symbols. 
InDesign is a poor document processor for our needs.

I would like to try Tex, but thought it best to ask if Tex can be used 
to create reasonably complicated color product brochures. The goal 
would be to produce brochures, newsletters, business proposals, and 
also "publish" data from a database that looks as if came from a 
high-end layout package such as Quark Express or  something similar.

Can Tex be easily used for these type of functions?

Your help would be greatly appreciated.

tex _can_ be used for these sorts of things -- tex can be used for
pretty much anything -- but whether you'ld _want_ to use it as part of a
commercial workflow for such highly graphical stuff is more doubtful.

the problem, it seems to me, is that most of tex's capabilities in this
area rely on its programmability (tex, per se, doesn't recognise
graphics at all, though it provides slots into which one might program
graphics capabilities).  since you need to ask your question at all,
you'll not be an expert tex programmer, which in turn means there will
be a long learning curve for you before you get to write anything
complicated for yourself.  (i speak from experience: i've enormous
experience of programming in the large, yet it's taken me more than a
decade to achieve my present capability of doing "most" tex-based things
_slowly_.)

there are semi-graphical front ends to tex; i don't know if any of them
even approach what you need.  i doubt it, but others may know better,
and will need to chip in to put me in my place.

Fairbarins, Ratcliffe, Kovacs and others,


Thank you all for the inputs. Yes, everything is working fine, now.
Between, Ratchiffe, you are right; a two hour study of the manual really 
would have worked. Infact I had the manual and went through it. Since I 
am getting close to deadlines, I could not really concentrate on what i 
was reading, and couldnt really assimilate. I started tweaking the 
natbib with possible options, but at that moment nothing worked out.

Thank you all once again, for the inputs and awfully sorry to distrub 
you all for this silly stuff.

Cheers,

Zach

Although I agree that Robin's note of caution should be
heeded, I do not think you should allow yourself to be
put off by the complexity of the task.  In Poland, for
example, there are publishing houses that use /only/
TeX (and its adjuncts, such as MetaPost) yet produce
colour artwork that equals, if not exceeds, anything
that Quark and its friends could accomplish. I would
strongly recommend communicating with the proprietor
of one of these, Boguslaw Jackowski <bop@bop.com.pl>,
who will -- I am sure -- reassure you that /anything/
is possible using TeX.

Message-ID: <200402091222.i19CMLQ23263@mailgate5.cinetic.de>

Hello,  
 
I think it is kind of a off-topic question and I apologize for that, but searching the web was not sucessful so far.  
I am looking for a program which reads/converts a normal text file into a bibtex file.   
A friend refused up to now to use a bibliography program and typed all his references into a text file (few 
hundreds already...). Copy-paste did the \cite{} work ,-) 
All references are ordered in the same way and I presume that a small script which reads in the first line as author 
= {}, second as year ={] ... and so on would do the job. But before I start writing it, I wanted to ask if such a script 
already exists and i would greatly appreciate if somebody can point me to a name/site.  
 
regards Martin

i'm sure jacko would indeed assure anyone that _anything_ is possible
using tex.  and quite right too.  another good candidate would be hans
hagen, who likewise does things that would challenge any of the paid-for
systems.

what i was questioning was whether it was rational for a publisher to
switch to using tex, instantaneously, because adobe has pulled the rug
out from under their feet.

sure, investigate tex as a future path, but don't think of it as the
way to keep the company going from today on.  you've got too much of a
learning curve for that.

If it's so urgent, you have a lot of late nights ahead.

    I am working on developing a TeX compiler.

I hope you are aware of exactly how huge a task this is.  A project
measured in years.

    I would like to know the exact step by step details in the process
    of converson of a tex doccument to a dvi file. 

Read tex.web + all the change files.  Oh, and the TeXbook, too.  For
starters.

    I want to know the external files accessed by the compiler.

There are literally thousands (potentially).  Fonts, macros,
configuration files, you name it.  Varies by implementation.

    Also does the latex.fmt directly uses the tex.fmt or not?

No.

Good luck,

I do not think it would be that difficult. Because the number of 
'difficult' programs to be written can be expected to be quite small and 
these can always be reused...it is certainly worth the trouble. Another 
option would be use both tex and GIMP for the purpose.

"\sim" seems to do the job (as in "a\sim b").

According to Scott Pakin's Comprehensive LATEX Symbol List...

o Depending on the font, you could try \texttildelow from the textcomp pkg.

o Use the url pkg.

I suspect the latter is what you want.

Oops! I too should've read the amsldoc more carefully! By the way don't 
you think ${}^A\!B$ gives a better looking result than ${}^AB$? So, maybe 
one can do something like

     \newcommand{\lsup}[2]{%

Well, it does with B but how about \Gamma, for instance?  You should include
something that reads the skew of the character (your first argument) and
corrects for it if you really want to do the job that well (off hand, I
can't remember what that involves).

?!?

Is the GIMP no longer ``merely'' a bitmap editor? Does it now handle 
vector graphics as vectors and text as type exporting as a 
resolution-independent .eps or .pdf?

The dearth of decent tools for such has kept my NeXT Cube on my desk 
and a Windows laptop in my kit bag for the past decade (and don't tell 
me that Skencil nee Sketch, Impress, Sodipodi &c. are suitable). I need 
things w/ the capabilities of Altsys Virtuoso / Macromedia FreeHand, 
Adobe Illustrator, FutureWave's SmartSketch, and Fractal Design 
(Creaturehouse) Expression. Really a shame that GYVE didn't get 
finished and that Canon didn't follow through on their offer to donate 
a drawing program to GNUstep....

One other tool which hasn't been mentioned yet AFAICT is Scribus (which 
does seem like quite a good beginning).

Since it uses XML for its file format, one could in theory set up some 
sort of database publishing system which would run out XML versions of 
a document, then do the typesetting from within Scribus, visually 
tweaking at need.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10402102150210.22370-100000@luna.mat.uniroma1.it>

Hi guys,
I'm GUI (Italy, Rome) and I'm experiencing some problems with PSfrag and
OpenOffice in latex:


------------------------------------------------------------------------
I: No label replacement
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In general I use SOffice (OpenOffice, I guess... ) on Linux to draw vector 
images; I need to insert Latex-type labels on the .eps image, but It
doesn't work for me. This is what I've tried to do:

  (my Latex preamble is standard, with minimal packages and options)

  -I have drawn the image and inserted some dummy labels 
   (for exmple the text "A");
  
  - I exported the image in EPS format;

  - in my Latex source I inserted: 
     \includepackage{graphicx} 
     \includepackage{psfrag}
  - and finally:
     \psfrag{A}{new label}
     \includegraphics {nameimage.eps}  

Compilation gives no problem, and the image is perfectly shown, 
but in the .ps output there's no label replacement.   

It seems like PSfrag doesn't recognize the dummy label "A" in the .eps
file. I wrote this letter with standard font....

I tried to use XFIG, but for me it's relly more user friendly SOffice; I'd
like to find a solution....

----------------------------------------------------------------
II: no smooth curves
----------------------------------------------------------------

when I print .eps images, every "smooth" curve is replaced by a
piecewise-linear one (if the original curve had many control point the
result is quite good however, but it's quite noticeable)



Have you got any idea?
Thank you a lot!!

Subject: [texhax] MF display window under MacOS X
Message-ID: <20040211113047.4413@smtp.numericable.fr>

I upgraded my TeX system under MacOS X and now MF display works. But I get
a tremendeously big window, much bigger than my screen, and the picture 
I'm expecting to see is not in the visible part. I have tried primitives like:

openwindow 1 from (-500,-500) to (500,500) at (-200,-200) ;
display currentpicture inwindow 1;

I can change those figures arbitrarily, they don't seem to do anything. 
Does anyone know how I can get control over the dimensions and internal
coordinates of that window? I didn't found any relevant command-line
option, and the texmf.cnf file doesn't handle that either.

It would be nice if one could specify the window geometry by usual X
Window syntax.

I'm using:
>Metafont (Web2C 7.5.2) 2.71828
>kpathsea version 3.5.2

Thanks in advance

Which installation are you using? If you're using Gerben's have you 
tried i-Installer's reconfigure button? Perhaps you should try the Mac 
OS X TeX list if you're using GW's TeX?

Sure thing.

Uh, you're missing the traditional sigdash ``-- '' separator here so 
that list software can automagically split off your signature so it's 
not multiply included for people who receive digest versions.

At a minimum, couldn't you configure your mail software to have 
multiple signatures and use a smaller, less ostentatious one when 
posting to a mailing list?

I know bandwidth & storage are cheap and all, but must we be so

Subject: [texhax] why the text around the figures disappear after a flashing
	?
Message-ID: <34211112.1076353189@EEN9016.een.bris.ac.uk>



Dear friends,

I cannot find a solution from any FAQ, and hope there are some help from 
you.

The problem is that in the .ps from dvips, some text around an inserted 
figure **flash** for a second before the figure appear, then the text 
disappear after the figure is shown. The figure is from `automatically 
calculate bounding box' from the `PS to EPS' function of GSview itself. I 
tried using \makebox, minipage to bound the figure, but no use.

The .pdf from pdflatex can solve this problem with correct text around the 
figures. The .pdf figure is generated by eps2pdf from .eps figures. But 
pdflatex cannot satisfy me in another issue (I am using MSC macro to draw 
MSCs, which cannot be shown by pdflatex.)

I attach the correct .pdf and wrong .ps files, and also the figure files. 
how can dvips or other means generate .ps file with text around figures 
***not disappearing***? or some parameters needed in the .tex for certain 
special figures?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,

Gary

plus: the beginning part of the attached files is these .tex:

resources with the message senders (e.g.\ hereby CM), etc. The processing 
protocol, agent ability and resource constraints of real-world systems 
limit the concurrency in designs to be quasi-concurrency in 
implementations, by context switch and scheduling algorithms.

Once the messages \texttt{chsw-1}, \texttt{chru-1} and \texttt{secon-1} are 
consumed by LSWR, CRH and SM respectively, the activities \textsf{chsw}, 
\textsf{chru} and \textsf{secon} start on the individual agents. In the 
simple running example, there are no further more agents involved, but 
complex cooperations with more communications among more agents

This discussion is a bit old now, but I though that I'd share my
thoughs on this last question with you. We can, of course, only
speculate about the real reason Knuth made Aring a special case.
I have a few guesses:

1) Generally, a font should have both "normal" accents, suitable for
   lower case letters, and "capital" accents, suitable for upper case
   letters. For instance, the acute accent should probably be more
   horizontal in its upper case version. Now, it was (is?) an accepted
   practice to not write accents on upper case letters in, e.g.,
   French, and the diaeresis accent does not occupy much vertical
   space, so for most Plain TeX accents it did not matter that there
   are no designated upper case accents. The Aring glyph, however, was
   somehow important enough to catch Knuth's attention. Maybe he
   considered the glyph primarily as the ?ngstr?m symbol and not a
   "normal letter", since (as far as I know) he neglected support for
   uring in Plain TeX, a glyph needed (I think) for Czech.

2) The Aring glyph does not occur very often. As far as I know it
   exists only in Scandinavian languages and, moreover, it is very
   rare as a first letter in a word. In fact, it is mostly seen in
   titles on book or magazine covers or in advertisements, i.e., as
   part of a logotype. In this case it is not uncommon to see an
   attached ring, especially if the logo is based on a sans serif font
   (consider for instance the logotype of the Swedish department store
   ?hl?ns). For running text, however, I maintain that the detached
   version is the norm.

3) It could be the case that the "Modern" typefaces normally had an
   attached ring, I don't know. I did not find any classical books
   printed in original "Modern" style typefaces.

Hope this is of interest,

For web graphics, perhaps.

I've tried the GIMP off and on for the past couple of years. It's 
gotten much better, especially of late, but still is lacking especially 
in terms of UI and ink controls (we are talking pre-press here, 
right?), and AFAICT, doesn't do the things I asked about above (still 
haven't tried the copy I d/l'd the other month...).

from, http://manual.gimp.org/manual/GUM/Prepress.html#449144
``Gimp is not as intuitive as Photoshop is about pre-press issues.
   Gimp is more focused on web design. In Gimp, you always see
   the image size as the web surfer would see it.''

For a more concrete example --- where's the gamut preview warning in 
the GIMP?

Here's a bullet list of things which need improvement:

http://www.designharbor.com/refs/grokking/node53.php3

And of course, while the GIMP is struggling to get CMYK support, 
PhotoShop et. al. are working in Hexachrome, and there're plug-ins like 
PowerTone to allow one to do spot colour separations from RGB images, 
and PhotoShop's preview of multi-channel images is quite good, often 
rivalling Cerilica's Truism (which tech I _really_ wish was more widely 
available).

http://www.blackfiveservices.co.uk/separate.shtml

I'd like for the GIMP to be more useful for pre-press, and was actually 
pushing for my previous employer to donate several years worth of 
colour separation and calibration data to the GIMP project before 
switching jobs. It's got a long way to go, though, and for the 
foreseeable future there will probably be ways in which PhotoShop has 
an advantage for print work.

Moreover, Adobe PhotoShop isn't the only graphics app (where's the 
equivalent to Corel Painter or Fauve Matisse or XRes?), and bitmaps 
aren't the only format in use --- even the quite nifty Cenon program 
which I just found really doesn't hold a candle to Macromedia Freehand 
/ Altsys Virtuoso or Adobe Illustrator, let alone Creaturehouse 
Expression, FutureWave SmartSketch is another app which really deserves 
to be looked at by efforts like Inkscape.

With that said, I'd like to put forward that for the TeX Harvest 
project, I felt obliged to use free software insofar as was possible:

http://www.tug.org/tug2003/donate/

Not sure what Duane Bibby scanned his illustration with, and the TeX 
Users Group logo was provided as an Adobe Illustrator file, and I had 
to use Adobe InDesign to set up the files used for the virtual fonts to 
access the commercial font Zapfino, but the typesetting was done w/ 
Omega and TeX (check the file info ;)

Hi,

I'm having a big problem trying to display simultaneous equations.

I want something like:

\[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{rclr}
      foo&=&bar\\
      bar&=&foo

  \right.
\]

but with both equations numbered.

Using:

\[
  \left\{

        foo&=&bar&\addtocounter{equation}{1}(\theequation)\\
        bar&=&foo&\addtocounter{equation}{1}(\theequation)
    \end{array}
  \right.
\]

doesn't display the equation number in line with equation numbers
from {align} or {eqnarray}'s etc, and so looks messy.

I just want two numbered equations, with one { to the left of them.

I'm using LaTeX.

Any help would be great

Thanks,

I have the following note to myself in my facts/ directory, where I store such
notes for future reference.  I just used it to install several packages
on a new laptop.  Whether it works specifically for tetex, I'm less sure, but
it works fine for latex on linux.

texconfig is a program that (among other things) causes tex and latex to
recognize the existence of new .sty and .cls and .def and .clo files added
to directories in
/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/
so that they are known to tex to be available.

for example, the files in ..../latex/foiltex and .../latex/dratex
were added by creating the directories,
then (as root) 
texconfig 
was run  and the item 
update ls-R
was selected
after which, latex recognised these input files as available.  Before running
texconfig, latex didn't know of their existence, even though they'd been there.

I think "update ls-R" 
actually reads
REHASH  rebuild ls-R database
on current versions
afterwards, select
EXIT  exit
to leave the program.

Hope this helps,

That will work on mostly any TeX installation.  I usually have a
directory somewhere in my private area where I write my
packages/classes, and put extra ones.  A symlink from inside the
directory tree searchable by LaTeX points to this directory.  (Note that
for a different *TeX flavor, such as eTeX, or plain TeX, you will need
to make your files available from another, respective, directory).  Then
you can run `texhash` (or `mktexlsr` on some TeX distributions) to
update distribution's hash of available package and class files (and any
other file looked up by Kpathsea) [And as was pointed out, the hash can
be updated by `texconfig`, as well].  Then you are ready to TeX.

It might be useful to know the directory under which to install packages
that you want visible by, say, LaTeX.  On a typical Debian system (using
a rather outdated teTeX) the directories you need are under
</usr/share/texmf/> (like </usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/>).  If you are
using a TeXlive system, you should consult your $VARTEXMF environment
variable.  (Both Bourne Shells and C Shells would recognise
`echo $VARTEXMF`).  You will usually need to install under
<$VARTEXMF/tex/>.

Well, in these situations, LaTeX also fails to create a log file, and

Maybe I'm missing something, but I use TEX's environment variables which
I set. e.g., in my .cshrc to do this. This leaves my main tex
distribution intact (so that when I upgrade it I don't need to go in and
fiddle, nor run any separate texconfig things, etc.) There's a big list
set out in section 4.1 of the Kpathsea documentation, and a brief
discussion in several FAQs. I found one at
http://www.ai.mit.edu/lab/sysadmin/latex/faq/ which is clear, but the
TeXFaqs searched with TEXINPUTS will also work. In particular, try
setting 

TEXINPUTS
BIBINPUTS
BSTINPUTS

to point to your private style files, etc. Paths are colon separated,
with a trailing colon pulling in (la)tex's defaults. A path ending in a
double slash is supposed to be recursive down the directory.

E.g.:

setenv TEXINPUTS .:/home/mylatex//:

Of course, this is all private to the user and installations where
multiple users share a single tex distribution may prefer to do it
centrally (or to pass around bits of .cshrc or .profile files).

It's also possible to do this with multiple texmf trees.  I don't know

This usually happens if the DVI file "is in use" (what happens when you try
to delete it?).

You can use the Filemon utility to find the guilty program:

In a word, no.

If packages were perfect and designed to cater for every possble
circumstance, this might just be true.  However, they are written by human
beings who, no matter how expert they may be, do not possess crystal balls.

Having said that, it is a common mistake to try bodging a remedy for
undesired output without taking a little time to search the various FAQ or
package listings to see if something suitable already exists.

Having said that, however, if you only need to adjust one simple single
slightly undesired instance, then why waste time?  If \newline, \vspace, or
anything else for that matter can fix it, ... just do it!

As with every aspect of life, peronal judgment is all important.

    I would like to know if Tex or Latex can do simple arithmetics.

Sure.

\newcount\foo
\foo = 0
\advance\foo by 3   % \foo = 3
\multiply\foo by 3  % \foo = 9
\divide\foo by 3    % \foo = 3 again

LaTeX has its own equivalent set of commands, but the above should work
in either.

There are many limitations and tricks.  It's all discussed at length in
any of the books and I expect in online docs as well.

Subject: [texhax] LaTeX and Type 1 fonts in Illustrator 10 under Windows ME
Message-ID: <5.2.1.1.2.20040215180239.024f3c50@trr5.mail.yale.edu>


I'm writing again on the subject of LaTeX labels on Adobe Illustrator 
figures.  My first message is here:

http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2003-November/001216.html

I regret that the problem is continuing to cause me considerable 
frustration.  Here is a review.  The way that I used to annotate figures in 
Illustrator was by LaTeXing a little file with the labels in, then turning 
it into a .ps file, then opening this file in Illustrator and then dragging 
the equations onto the figure.  The problem is that, with more recent 
versions of LaTeX, when the .ps file is opened in Illustrator, it makes 
substitutions for the CM fonts and ruins the equations.  I am using MiKTeX 
and Illustrator 10 under Windows ME, but I gather that there are similar 
problems with Mac OS X.

I do not believe that the problem is a result of updates in Illustrator 
because I can open old .ps files in Illustrator 10 as I used to.  It seems 
that something has changed in recent versions of LaTeX.

I am aware of the Warmread package and the marked objects plug-in for Adobe 
Illustrator.  But that method is awkward.  Being able to drag to precise 
locations, to see immediately what you are getting, and copy and resize is 
far more convenient.  I am told that Latin Modern fonts would not be 
substituted by Adobe, but I haven't been able to get them to work.  Also I 
gather that something like  "Enfocus PitStop" would help - but there must 
be an easier answer that does not involve buying and learning to use 
professional fonts tools.

Does anyone know what has changed in LaTeX to cause this change in 
function?  And how can it be reversed?  I have tried installing an old 
versions of LaTeX (TeXLive 4 and 6) and using .ps produced by that, but 
with no success.  Should some old fonts be copied in place of the new ones?

Any suggestions would be very gratefully received!

There are lots of solutions, none perfect.

Purists would do the presentation in LaTeX using one of the latex
packages designed specifically for this (slides or seminar or beamer or
... in increasing order of complexibility/capability) all of which will
take some learning to use effectively.

The quick and dirty solution is to cut out the relevant bits from the
latex output ( .ps or .pdf) and turn them into objects (.eps I think or
images: gif, png, ...) Powerpoint can understand. Since you only need
screen resolution, the easiest way is to generate a ps (or pdf) from
latex and use a tool (e.g., ghostscript or acrobat) to dump out a gif or
png which you can then manipulate (trim, colour, ...) in an image
processing bit of software (Photoshop or PaintShop or whatever under
Windows - I'd use gimp in Linux but I guess you have a windows machine).

Indeed, what I'd do is to take your LaTeX'ed paper, preview it at twice
the size you want the final equation to look like, take a screen
snapshot, and then play with the result in some image software to
generate a gif or png of the equation you want to present in Powerpoint.
Better, when it works, is to turn your paper into a pdf (pdflatex or
ps2pdf or ...) and then use Acrobat's image selection tool to copy a
selection as an image, which again can be pasted into an image
manipulating application. 

This is quick and robust for a few equations. If you have lots to do,
and do it often, you might invest some time in the LaTeX presentation
packages and use Acrobat in full-screen mode to give your presentation.

The newest TeX Collection no longer supports Mac OS 9. You'll need to 
install OzTeX, CMacTeX or something similar. The archived Mac-TeX pages 
should be of help: http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/default9.html. It has 
links to the various sites to download systems.

Keith:

I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but I ran across this
recently.  A clever person at Kluwer, the journal publisher, made this
once upon a time for the class files they use for journals.  It makes
the Kluwer logo.  I can't say I understand it entirely (looks like PS,
but what's the "\string" stuff inside?), but maybe someone else on
this list can be more enlightening if you think it would be the right
direction to go in.

Good luck,

-tom

One solution is an old package called sprite that is still, I assume, 
available on ctan.  It is somewhat slow, but it allows you to make up any 
symbol you like as a "bag of dots" and at any resolution you like.  I use 
it to make a letterhead for my university, complete with coat of arms.  It 
works with any flavor of tex.

Try the "caption" or "caption2" package, available through CTAN or (possibly) 
already installed by your TeX distribution.

find this interesting... Here I have copied a useful contribution from

Furthermore I have still some problems when I try to use the command \citet, 
which, in numerical citation mode, should produce the authors name's followed 
by the reference's number.

 
My document reads like this (PNAS file)
-----------------------------------------
\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}

\begin{document}
...
Although previous work \citep{Smith01,Wilson02,Sole03} strongly critized these 
methods, \citet{Alonso04} discovered a new dance in Paco Pigali boite 
(BH, MG, Brazil) that produce an instataneous sense of happiness to those 
who dance.
...

\bibliographystyle{pnas}
\bibliography{file.bib}
\end{document}
-----------------------------------------
Where [numbers] is the option for numerical citation mode (otherwise authors 
year is by default in natbib.sty) and sort&compress produces (1-5) rather than
(1;2;3;4;5) as required. 

When I use the plainnat.bst instaed, my document reads (PLAINNAT file)
-----------------------------------------
\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}

\begin{document}
...
Although previous work \citep{Smith01,Wilson02,Sole02} strongly critized these 
methods, \citet{Alonso03} discovered a new dance in Paco Pigalli boite (BH,MG,
Brazil) that produce an instataneous sense of happiness to those who dance.
...

\bibliographystyle{plainnat}
\bibliography{file.bib}
\end{document}
-----------------------------------------

When I am using plainnat, I don't have any problem in obtaining right textual
refereces. I mean that when I compile PLAINAT file, I obtain:

-----------------------------------------

...
Although previous work (2-4) strongly critized these methods, Alonso et al.
(1) discovered a new dance in Paco Pigalli boite (BH,MG,Brazi) 
...

By contrast by using document PNAS file, I obtain first a latex warning:

and then the final document produces a citation as follows:

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20040217142947.02d1fe98@imap-k.nd.edu>

Hello everyone.

I have two questions, both of which likely have a simple solution.

The first question I have concerns how to un-italicize all of the 
lower-case Greek letters in a document. Rather than a method that applies 
the method to each and every lower-case Greek letter, I would prefer some 
sort of global command that would always give un-italicized lower-case 
Greek letters.

Also, is there a simple way to output two sets of words, one flush on the 
left side of the page and the other flush on the right side of the page on 
the same line? An example is:

\underline{\textsc{Home}}   \hspace{11.5cm}   \underline{\textsc{University}}\\

(where _Home_ would be flush on the left side of the page and _University_ 
flush on the right side of the page) but determining the value for \hspace 
is iterative and thus time consuming. Does an easier method exist?

Thanks for any thoughts,
Ken

Subject: [texhax] undefined control sequence with mla bibliography style
Message-ID: <4032E722.9030203@binghamton.edu>

I'm new to LaTeX on Linux, relatively new to Linux, in fact.  Running 
Libranet 2.8.1, with tetex, using gvim as editor.  I read the guidance 
on ctan.org on how to install new packages, and I installed mla style (I 
think I did it properly.)

When I process my text file, containing just one reference to a book 
(it's a junk file that I'm just learning on.)  The first latex run gets 
me an error message, something along the lines of "undefined control 
sequence at end of line . . .  /protect /author /citeyear. . ."

then I run bibtex from the command line in a terminal window.  Then I go 
back and run latex twice more.

The result is *almost* what I want.  Citation in text reads [Saarni 
1999], but the bibliography entry reads something like 
"[Saarni1999][Saarni1999] C Saarni, Development (so on and so forth)" 
In other words, the cite key is listed, twice, in the bibliography.

Any advice?

Thanks.

Dear Tug,

I am a member of the TUG group. I am having some problems with equation
breaking in TeX.

Is there a way to break long display equation (which is out of text or
column width) in LaTeX automatically without manual intervention?

I am working on this lately and am not finding a proper way out.

Please help me if there is some package or way around to achieve
automatic breaking of Long display equations in LaTeX.

Thanking you,

With kind regards,

Here's a somewhat crude methosd I used to get numbered "cases" in 
equations, which is similar to your requirements.

    

     \usepackage{amsmath}
     \usepackage{calc}		

	\newenvironment{ncases}[4]{%
  	  \parbox{\textwidth-2cm}{%
            \begin{equation*}
              #1=
             \begin{cases}
               #2
             \end{cases}
           \end{equation*}}
           \hfill
           \parbox{1cm}{%
             \begin{eqnarray}
               {}\label{#3}\\
               {}\label{#4}
             \end{eqnarray}}}


     \begin{document}

       \begin{ncases}
         {|x|}{x, &\text{if $x\ge 0$}\\
         -x,&\text{if $x\le 0$}}{pos}{neg}
       \end{ncase}

       From this it easily follows that 
       \begin{equation}
        |x|\ge0\;\text{for all $x\in R$}
      \end{equation}
      for if $x\ge 0$, then by Equation~\eqref{pos}, we have $|x|=x\ge0$ and 
      if $x\le0$, then by Equation~\eqref{neg}, we have $|x|=-x\ge0$.

This will not give the needed input, since the words "iff" and "and" will 
also be treated as mahematical formulas. The best way seems to be to use 
the "amsmath" package and do

        \begin{equation*}
          a=b\;\text{iff}\;a\geq b\;\text{and}\;a\leq b
        \end{equation*}

I have used the following in concert programs to produce lines of the form
I think you want:

	\line{The Spirit of Gambo\hfil Tobias Hume}

This produces a line where _The Spirit of Gambo_ is flush at the left margin
and _Tobias Hume_ is flush at the right margin.  Change the text to whatever
you like with or without underlining ... no computations needed ... let TeX 
do it ...

Hope this helps,

I know this probably isn't the right place for this question, but I've looked everywhere on the net and posted on a half dozen different mailing lists and no one seems to be able to help, so I'll give it a shot here.

I have a .ps file that I created with tex/dvips.  When I try to print it I want it to print to a different tray on my printer than what the default is, but when I type lpr -Pmpls_office2 -o media=tray1 test.ps it prints from the default tray (tray2).  But if I create a .ps file using enscript and then use the same print command as abore it prints from tray2.  Its an HP Phaser 4400 printer, and I'm using SuSE 8, 8.2.  Does anyone have any ideas about how I can fix this??

This works (although I would have thought there's a better way); I got it by
looking at symbols-a4.pdf (which lists all fonts and symbols available and
can be found on CTAN).  Of course, you will need to extend the \let's to
cover all (lower-case) letters.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{txfonts}
\let\alpha\alphaup
\let\beta\betaup
\begin{document}
$\alpha\beta$
\end{document}

This would be best implemented by creating upmath.sty as follows:

\let\alpha\alphaup
\let\beta\betaup
...

and then putting \usepackage{upmath.sty} in your documents.

Phil Parker gave the simple answer - there are others: use a two-column
layout with left flush on the left and right flush on the right; use tabular
with \tabcolsep=0pt and two columns (ditto) ...  These would be more quickly
altered if it became necessary.

Let me comment that the question suggests a little light manual reading
might be in order.  No offence, please.

Since the mla package only consists of one single file it either works or
doesn't at all!  That is, installation is only about making sure LaTeX knows
where to find files; it is not about getting them to work.

Alos, did you actually read the mla.sty usage instructions?

Would you like to tell us how you are making the bibliography?  What
packages are you using and which commands (for example, \citeyear is
definitely not defined by mla).

Aha!  But which bibliography style are you using?

So, it's obviously to do with the bibliography packages you are using and
nothing to do with mla.sty (or at least not the one I have in my
installation - MiKTeX).

P.S. I don't want to sound nasty, but mla.sty actually does very little, why
bother using it?

however, since the op was writing latex, and since latex doesn't have
the plain tex \line command, this suggestion doesn't help much.

It's a horrible bodge as it is, but you could work on it (needs
\usepackage{amsmath}):

\begin{align}
  foo &= bar\\[-3.3ex]
  \text{How about this? }
  \left\{ \vphantom{\frac00} \right. \hspace{1.7em} \nonumber\\[-3.3ex]
  bar &= foo
\end{align}

Hi All

How about defining a macro like this

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\newcommand\Iff[2]{\text{\quad iff\ }#1\ \text{and}\ #2}

\begin{document}

$$a = b \Iff{a \geq b}{a \leq b}$$

\end{document}

References: <NFEEKNIBLKOGCHGPBJDHEENADPAA.philipratcliffe@tiscali.it>
Message-ID: <40338962.1080505@binghamton.edu>

I am using the mla.bst bibliography style.  The citation in my source 
file is like this:  \cite{Saarni1999}.  the bibliography style command 
is like this:  \bibliographystyle{mla}.  At the end I put 
\bibliography{references}.  I could post the file if it might help--it's 
about two paragraphs long, just my son's social studies essay on Sam 
Adams, that I appropriated to practice LaTeX on Linux with.  I threw in 
the single citation, totally unrelated to Sam Adams, just to see if it 
would work.  Saarni1999 is a reference to a book that is in one of my 
real .bib files (references.bib).

Why mla?  My high school daughter has to write a term paper using MLA 
standards for references/citations, etc.  I thought it might be a handy 
way for her to write it, and a good way to introduce her to LaTeX, in 
contrast to her MS Word-centric school.

Subject: [texhax] Abbreviated journal names with BibTeX
Message-ID: <y658yj08gth.fsf@minnie.esd.mun.ca>

Hello,

 I am finishing a paper that will be submitted to a journal and have
made a .bst file to provide the correct formatting information for the
bibliography.  I have previously set up a .bib file in which all journal names
are written out in full, but the target journal uses abbreviated journal names.  I
would like to know if it is possible to convert the full names to
abbreviated names, e.g. "Journal" to "J", Physics to "Phys" etc
without modifying the database itself.

I am aware of the use of macros in a .bst file to expand abbreviations
but, as far as I can see, this will not work in the present case
because the .bib entries contain disallowed characters (e.g. spaces).

I have searched the FAQ, and more broadly on the web but have found
no solution (other than the inelegant one of hacking the .bbl file
with a good editor).  Of course I may have missed an important entry
or misunderstood something iin the documents I consulted, in which
case I appologise for troubling you.

Thanks for any help.

Hi,

The subject 'phrase' is coming out with (what I think is) too much 
space between the 'r' and the '(mod p)'.  I've experimented with the 
other three close relatives of \pmod, and haven't found anything that 
suits.

My reading of various docs and FAQs makes me think that it's a lost 
cause, but: is there a way to reduce the horizontal space preceding the 
\pmod?

Thanks for your help.

Justin

why a lost cause?  the stuff about finding the definitions of commands,
and about them, in the uk faq should surely have pointed you in the
right direction.

\makeatletter
\renewcommand*\pmod[1]{\allowbreak \mkern 12mu({\operator@font mod}\,\,#1)}
\makeatother

reduces the space from 18mu.

\Delta) \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0 \end{bmatrix}

(I-\beta \Delta) \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\\0 \end{bmatrix}\nonumber \\&
(\phi(i)-\phi(j))(\phi(k)-\phi(l))

\end{eqnarray}

put \nonumber at the end of each line if you don't want a number.

A bmatrix is a bracket:[
I think $\bigl \{ stuff \bigr \}$
and \Bigl \Bigr
and \BIGl \BIGr
give increasingly bigger left (l) and right (r) braces
They are math equations.

Subject: [texhax] User Defined Values
Message-ID: <Law11-F43ONBCiDtUUa000023c1@hotmail.com>

I was wondering if someone could tell me how to define something (not a 
command but a
value), and then call upon the value at another time. For example, suppose I 
wanted to make
my own title page (perhaps a bad example but it illustrates the point), 
which is to include a title,
the author name(s), and his/her university.

What I want is something like:

\University = Whatever U.;
\Name = Whomever;
\Title = Title of the work;

where University, Name, and Title all represent some unser supplied value.

Then, using these definitions (\University, \Name, \Title), I want to call 
upon them at a later time. An example might be:

\begin{center}
\Title\\
\Name\\
\University\\
\end{center}

The goal would then to have a centered page where the unser defined values 
for Title, Name, and University would be displayed.

Thanks for any help.

Yep; this does what I want.  I hadn't thought in terms of 
'renewcommand', since I try to avoid changing the environment when I 
can.  I thought it was a lost cause because I couldn't find a "setting" 
to change or a command to use.

Thanks for your help!

I recently installed the new collection.  I find that pdftex appears not to support tiff files as graphics any more.  On my laptop, I have not istalled the new version, and the old version still works.  For the record, my old version is 3.14159 and the new version is 3.141592

Is this a known bug or a new feature?

Thank you for any help you may be able to provide.

that's the underlying tex version; the most recent release of pdftex is
1.10 (with a letter suffix) -- i dont' recall which version is on
texlive.

> Is this a known bug or a new feature?

supporting tiff (which is a dog's breakfast of a format) was a mistake
in the first place.  i think the support was removed before pdftex
reached version 1.0, but i don't follow the development in detail.

if you were using tiff in one its non-lossy compression instances,
convert the images to png (which is a modern, standardised, non-
propietary format which is free of patents).  if the images are jpegs
wrapped in tiff (like our [spit] scanner provides), i guess you convert
to jpeg.  pdftex still accepts both png and jpeg format images.

Subject: [texhax] Booklet A6 format
Message-ID: <4039BF20.3050803@semafor.ch>

Hi all,

I need some hints:

I want to create a booklet with format DIN A6. That means that I want to 
write my file on DIN A5 landscape and put 2 pages (A6) on it.

like this (the whole page is A5 in landscape orientation):

+--------+--------+
|        |        |
|        |        |
|   A6   |   A6   |
|        |        |
|        |        |
+--------+--------+

So:

- Is there a documentclass option for A5 (like a4paper)?
- How to divide a page in two columns?

And:
- How to print it like a book?
   That means first page and last page on the same sheet.

   Lets say my document had 8 pages:

    sheet 1: first side   sheet 1: second side
   +--------+--------+    +--------+--------+
   |        |        |    |        |        |
   |        |        |    |        |        |
   |  p. 1  |  p. 8  |    |  p. 2  |  p. 7  |
   |        |        |    |        |        |
   |        |        |    |        |        |
   +--------+--------+    +--------+--------+


    sheet 2: first side   sheet 2: second side
   +--------+--------+    +--------+--------+
   |        |        |    |        |        |
   |        |        |    |        |        |
   |  p. 3  |  p. 6  |    |  p. 4  |  p. 5  |
   |        |        |    |        |        |
   |        |        |    |        |        |
   +--------+--------+    +--------+--------+

   Is this a TeX-problem or should I solve this with
   a ps tool (like ps2ps or ps2pdf)?


Thanks for any advices!

I had a similar problem not long ago - the best solution I've found is to
make it like normal as A6, create a .ps of it, and use mpage to put them
onto A5. mpage also has nice things for ordering the pages 1&4,2&3 for
binding and so forth.

You might also look at  psbook  which produces a new ps file with pages
rearranged for folding to make the book.

Does someone have an explanation for this?
When I run latex as a nis user it is much slower compared to a local user. 
I've experienced this for two different linux distributions. The only way I 
have found around this is to create an identical local user to override the 
nis user.

Subject: [texhax] setspace.sty
Message-ID: <1077437318.15677.181440815@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Dear Tex readers,

I have to urgently set the spacing in my thesis and am having problems
with both the doublespace and singlespace packages. I am using Latex to
create a PDF document with fonts and the pslatex package. There is no
problem when I process a self-contained file (ie: all input for LaTex is
in one file) which is an "article" document style but the problem occurs
when I use a "report" file with multiple input files read in during
processing.

My setup is as follows:

\documentclass[12pt]{report}
\usepackage{setspace}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{pslatex}
\begin{document}
\input{mypreamble}
\end{document}

There are of course other packages and input files. The processing stops
with the message:

! File ended while scanning use of \@writefile.
<inserted text>
                \par
1.25 \begin{document}

?

What am I missing here to make sure that setspace is used properly?

Any help would be appreciated since I want to submit my thesis ASAP!

regards

Mike

the problem isn't visible on my system.

add \setcounter{errorcontextlines}{999} somewhere before
\begin{document}, delete any existing .aux files, and run the thing
again.

post the resulting log (_don't_ omit things that "aren't interesting",
like you omitted the other packages ... they could be significant to
someone else).

Back at the time when I was writing a script having a similiar setup to
yours (A5 pages on A4 sheets), I tried a number of options.  Package
geometry will probably be useful to you, but I didn't find a way to
distribute the pages as needed from within LaTeX.  I tried tried using
`psnup`, `pstops`, `mpage`, `psbook` and `psresize`.  There appeared to
be a number of bugs regarding the paper size that ends up in the PS
document.  What I ended up using was:

[In the LaTeX file:]
	\documentclass[twoside,10pt]{book}
	
[A6 paper is supported by geometry:]
	\usepackage[dvips,a5paper,twoside,includemp]{geometry}
[To your taste:]
	\geometry{	marginparwidth=0.7cm,
			lmargin=1.5cm,	rmargin=1.5cm,
			tmargin=2cm,	bmargin=2cm}

[In a script that prepares the paper for printing:]
	#!/bin/sh
	
	psbook tex_outp.ps with_pages_reordered.ps
	export PAPERSIZE=a5
	mpage -m0 -2 with_pages_reordered.ps > with_pages_grouped.ps
	psresize -Pa5 -pa4 -q with_pages_grouped.ps ready_for_pringing.ps
	 
	echo "NOTE: You probably need not rotate the pages when re-inserting them!"

In all likelihood, this as zilch to do with TeX/LaTeX and friends, and 
a lot to do with your whole environment.

Check with your system mavins to figure out what is going on.  Look for:
   - $PATH entries on the network, possibly pointing to
     non-existent servers
   - different $PATH entries for local vs network login
   - "." in your path, and slow access to servers
   - a potentially uncountable number of other gotchas
     that justify paying your system mavins the big bucks :-}

What do you mean by "script"?  That is the problem I have encountered.
Have you tried ${\cal{L}}$ (for caligraphic)?  Is that satisfactory?
If so, it may solve your problem, but not all of the caligraphic characters
are what I've wanted when I thought I wanted "script".

Robin,

Thank you very much for the information.  I am not knowledgeable about
graphics formats.  I have now done some reading on the subject, and I'll be
using png for all the figures I prepare.

I am a chemcial engineer, recently retuired from DuPont.  I am preparing a
few monographs using pdfTeX, and I had been using tiff format, and suddenly
without warning, I was in trouble.

The documentation for pdftex needs a little work in view of all this, but
I'm sure that's not your problem.

Many thanks for your help.

Tom Keane

Chemarrow.sty usefully defines a no. of arrows/harpoons for writing 
chemical reactions
but the horizontal spacing between items is too short, cf. 1st two lines

$$ \mathrm{CH_3CH_3+O_2 \chemarrow CH_3\dot{C}H_2 + H\dot{O}_2} $$
$$ \mathrm{CH_3CH_3+O_2 \rightarrow   CH_3\dot{C}H_2 + H\dot{O}_2} $$

Also the text above or below the extensible arrow is too large and needs to be
2 sizes down (?)

$$ \mathrm{A+B \autorightarrow{$k_2$}{{\scriptsize 1,000 K}} C+D} $$

is there a more elegant way to redefine \autorightarrow etc to incorporate 
these

This was half true. The trailing slash in my $HOME was causing kpsewhich and 
others to conduct recursive searches (or something) at the point of the 
resulting double slash in the final .tex file path. In other words a few gigs 
of data was being searched for constructing a minor dvi, never mind trying to 
output a thesis. Nevertheless, all fixed now :)

Dear TeX users,

not declare the figure environment inside table. Is there some package

John,

     Thanks for the response.  I tried your suggestion of ${\cal{L}}$ and it
worked nearly ok. I would have preferred an L with a line on the top. What I
am
looking for is an L, like the L you write for the Laplace transform.

\includegraphics does not need a figure round it.

so

\usepackage{graphicx}
...
\begin{document}
...
\begin{tabular}{...}
\includegraphics[width=...]{thumb} & ...\\
\includegraphics[width=...]{forefinger} & ...\\

Message-ID: <FDTRTS09HB1ZYSTP8582YVOK373RM54.403b9412@cayley>

Dear Friends:
This may be a question more properly directed to the WinEdt/MikTeX mailing 
list, but that list is apparently restricted and my post to it was rejected.

Off and on for the past couple of weeks, and today many times, when I try to 
process a file (even containing just one word), MikTeX complains 

"LateX failed to create a dvi file.  For possible
explanations, start the command from the command prompt or read the log
file."

Well, in these situations, LaTeX also fails to create a log file, so there's 
nothing to learn there.   Moreover, I cannot figure what command to run from 
the command prompt in order to catch any output.  The MiKTeX command

%B\Exec\MiKTeX\LaTeX.edt'

certainly does not work.   I have used LaTeX for years and MiKTeX for a 
number of months, but never seen this error. 

Have any of you had this experience?  Any suggestions?  .......Edgar
P.S. I am on a PC running XP pro.

Don't confuse the figure floating environment with the command used to
insert .ps graphics into your document (i.e. \includegraphics).

\usepackage{graphicx}

This is a WinEdt error message. I would suggest that you try out the
following when the problem occurs:

1) open a command-prompt window
2) cd into the directory, where the LaTeX document is
3) run latex:
     latex YOURDOC.tex
   (replace YOURDOC with the name of your document)
4) see what happens

You can reply directly, if you need further assistance.

Regards,
Christian

Well, you could join it, like any other list.  But the question is, in fact,
more rightly put here.

If it's off and on, there must be a difference between off and on ...

Actually, I think that's WinEdt complaining, but it's only trying to be
helpful.

That means, open a DOS window in the relevant directory and type latex
filename.tex (from WinEdt that's rather easy to do - there's a button for a
Commmand Prompt.

This is obviously a WinEdt macro not a MiKTeX command.  And, as WinEdt

How about a bit more info on exacly what you're trying to LaTeX?

The dvi format is supposed to be platform-independent. My experiments have
not included Macs, but among IBM mainframes, PCs with Windows or DOS or
OS/2, and unix/linux systems, it is. Just do a binary copy or FTP of the dvi
to the Mac and you should be able to preview, print, etc.

If the .tex input file is truly plain 7-bit ASCII, it is also
platform-independent and will compile on any machine with a suitable version
of (La)TeX.

Dear Tug,

I am using the package lineno.sty for generating line numbers in my dvi

The package is very good, except i am not getting line numbers for array

Please let me know if you have any suggetions to  get line numbers

If by 'Mac.tex', you mean "TeX on the Mac", you have a plethora of

Subject: [texhax] PlainTeX/LaTeX 'Best Practices' help request
Message-ID: <20040226030640.91229.qmail@web14422.mail.yahoo.com>

I'm working on a content management system which
currently publishes HTML.  I'd like to also natively
publish PlainTeX, and maybe LaTeX (it may be easier to
use the higher granularity of PlainTeX, as the tool
already has access to substantial metadata that one
might otherwise rely on LaTeX to generate).

The tool has "internal string defaults" that it uses
to markup content, but you can override anything with
a simple text configuration file (for example, you
can specify 'pre' and 'post' tags, like for SGML
output).  Now, I'm working on getting good
configuration defaults for PlainTeX (and LaTeX).

I'm currently developing on Win32 using MikTeX,
but the code is cross-platform and I'm porting it
back to a number of Unix/Linux variants.  At the
simplest level, it's merely a command-line 'data
compiler' like any command-line compiler for 
programming:  text files (and resources like images)
are read in, transformed, and written out (as HTML,
TeX, DocBook, etc.)

I've bought copies of most of the TeX and LaTeX
books (Knuth, Lamport, Kopka, both Goossens books,
Seroul, Eijkhout, etc.) and have read much of the
freely available TeX intro documentation available on
the web.  However, I'm most interested in "best
practices" for robust (and beautiful) cross-platform
TeX authoring.  These will become internal 'defaults',
and users can override with whatever dialect or
customization they want.  Rather than learning these
through experimentation, I thought it best that I
find an experienced TeX author (I'd need 'review'
help anyway).

I have some 70+ 'regression tests' that I run, most
fairly small (a few paragraphs, an itemized list, 
an enumerated list, a nested section, etc.)  I'd like
to send my HTML output to a TeXpert who would send me
back a "best practices" translation in PlainTeX (or
LaTeX).  I'll modify my tool until it has resource
granularity to generate the same TeX source code
(including spacing, comments, and indenting).  Thus,
I *don't* merely want a TeX file that "works" or
which looks nice; I want a "best possible expression
in TeX" file.  (Yes, that can be subjective, which
is why users can override internal defaults.)

As this may seem quite similar to 'real work', it's
only fair that I state this is not currently an
open source project.  And, current plans are to 
eventually release it commercially.

As far as compensation, we'd have to work something
out.  Aside from 'thanks', we could look at access
to the software and documentation, and possibly
some modest dollars or financial contribution to TUG.
This is a small private effort, so we don't have a
Microsoft-sized budget.

Perhaps we could also look to summarizing our findings
in a 'best practices' document of example TeX
publishing scenarios.  I'd be interested in using
that, if anyone made it available.

Anyone interested in playing?

You want the indentfirst package from CTAN. (And a blank line is a 
better paragraph separator, since it makes your source a bit easier to 
read.)

why?  because it's a common (majority?) style in english-language
typography.

why didn't _you_ bother to look at the faq, after you'd received the
copy of your mail advertising it? -- got to http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq and
enter "indent" in the search box.

The first sentence in a paragraph should not be indented. It's a sign of
typographic weakness. The total shape of a text block should be a square
(that's why you'll have to use \noindent for the first paragraph after a
block quotation). Maybe it's best for you to consider the indent as a
paragraph "separator", instead of an "initiator".

P.S. The \indent function is probably what you're looking for, but don't say
     I didn't warn you for bad esthetics!

    Perhaps we could also look to summarizing our findings

This would be nice to have.

The "best practice" which comes to my mind is something you probably are
already well aware of -- avoid hardwiring font choices, spacing choices,
etc., in the TeX document.  Instead, use macros.  That's the only
feasible way to allow users to override stuff anyway.  Even stuff like
an em dash is useful to put as a macro, so as to be able to get
consistent spacing.

For LaTeX, it might be best to design your own document class.  Depends
on exactly what's being targeted, I guess.

Good luck!

Respected Sir,

I am a normal TeX user, I am facing problem of
hyphenated break at the end of the page, which can be
removed by inserting \break command before the word
which  is breaking over the pages or by having it in
\hbox{wordbreaoverpages}, is there any solution (like
some penalty variables such as \widowpenalty and
\clubpenalty for widow and orphans) to protect the
hyphenation of words at page break.

I found a variable named \brokenpenalty which can be
set to avoid hyphenation of words at page break but
other problem arises with this is that the last line
which was having hyphenated word break at the end,
moves to next page, that is not right solution
actually line should not move to next page, just only
the last word (word breaking over pages) should either
adjusted on same page or move to next page.

Waiting for your kind support and thanking you in
advance.

Not possible, I fear : TeX breaks paragraphs into lines
asynchronously w.r.t. breaking galleys into pages, and
thus (in standard TeX, at least) there can be no feedback
from the page-breaking algorithm to the line-breaking 
algorithm.  With some work you could probably devise
a multi-pass approach which detected infelicitous hyphens
at page breaks and fed back information for TeX to use on
a subsequent pass; TeX would then adjust the line-breaking
parameters for the paragraph(s) in question.  Not a task
to be underaken lightly, though ...

All others are not current and shouldn't actually be used to install

I apologize in advance if this is available in the faq-s or documentation,
but I've searched in vain, including asking others privately and searching
the amsmath documentation.
I've long wanted a capital cursive A --- not the curly script-like capital A
but the one we were taught to make in grade school; like the lower case cursive
a but the size of a capital letter: a distorted oval with a tail at the lower
right --- for use as a symbol in physical chemistry for the affinity that
wouldn't be so easily confused with other capital A-s that float about.
In desperation, I came up with the following kluge that causes even me to 
shudder, and will clearly get me into trouble with the automatic sizing 
mechanisms of LaTeX, as witnessed by the final equation in the example below.
Can someone help me find the right way to generate this character?  At least
on my installation, the first line and first two displayed equations look fine
(but I'd much rather accomplish this in an approved manner, consistent with
the expectations of LaTeX) and the last displayed equation makes the
A in the derivative much too big, although the subscripted A is about right.

One hands-on way to handle this is a macro \pseudopar, which I wrote
to force paragraph breaks in the sort of three-page paragraph that
is much loved by 15th century writers of Italian.

\def\pseudopar{\parfilskip=0pt\par\parfilskip=1fil\noindent}

You have to set the pages once, to choose the point for inserting
\pseudopar, but it works nicely, and can solve problems of delayed
triggering of the \output routine rather well.  It would certainly
work to deal with this hyphenation problem.

The really cautious might want to save the value of \parfilskip and
restore it.  I have never found this necessary.

Subject: [texhax] comments on your mla-paper package
Message-ID: <200402271718.i1RHI5Q12402@mailgate5.cinetic.de>

Hi,

yesterday I installed the new MikTeX version. At first I was happy to find your mla-paper package, but then I realized that it does not work for my purposes and that it is actually dangerous because there already exists an older - very different - mla.sty file (which I have been using).

So I had to delete your mla.sty in order to be able to continue using the old mla.sty (which works perfectly). I am attaching the old mla.sty file and the corresponding .bst files for your information. In my system, the pathnames are mytex/bibtex/bst/mla for the .bst files and mytex/tex/latex/mla for the .sty files. 

The header of the old mla.sty file looks as follows:

% Latex style file MLA for use with MLA.bst
% taken completely from the file chicago.sty and
% modified slightly as documented.
% 3/25/97 added functions for the MLAnnote.BST Annotated %bibliography
% Thomas_Weissert@irwins.pvt.k12.pa.us on 10/22/95

You should be aware that it is very dangerous (actually a no-no) in LaTeX to name new style (or other) files using filenames that already exist, so you should rename your package using a different name for your style file!

Your package may work for short term papers, but not for M.A. and PhD theses. I wrote my M.A. thesis using LaTeX and the old mla.sty, and I?m working on my PhD thesis now. I can tell you that I?m not listing all the bibliography entries by hand! I?m using bibtex, and with WinBibDB it?s actually quite easy because there is a user-friendly interface (almost like EndNote).

A very important feature of the old mla.sty file is the command \cite with its different modifications (see the attached mla.sty file) ? in combination with bibtex and WinBibDB, this is a really powerful tool that saves a lot of time!

Some other comments: You talk about double spaces after periods. LaTeX automatically makes a large space after each period ? conversely, if you just want a ?single space? (for example after an abbreviation like ?Washington, D. C.? or if you are writing in German, where the convention is to put only a small space after a period ending a sentence), you have to explicitly tell LaTeX to do this by typing ?Washington, D.~C.\?.

For details on MLA Style, you should refer people to the MLA Style Manual: A Guide to Scholarly Publishing by Gibaldi. This is the authoritative guide published by the MLA Association.

Again, please change the filename so that people don?t get confused and still have the choice between the old and your mla.sty file (and package).

Many thanks & cheers,

Anne Glatz, Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva (glatz3@hei.unige.ch)

        % This restriction helps ensure that all standard styles are identical.
        % The file btxbst.doc has the documentation for this style.
% The following text is the header for chicago.bst:
% "Chicago" BibTeX style, chicago.bst
% ===================================
%
% BibTeX `chicago' style file for BibTeX version 0.99c, LaTeX version 2.09
% Place it in a file called chicago.bst in the BibTeX search path.
% You need to include chicago.sty as a \documentstyle option.
% (Placing it in the same directory as the LaTeX document should also work.)
% This "chicago" style is based on newapa.bst (American Psych. Assoc.)
% found at ymir.claremont.edu.
%
%   Citation format: (author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name and author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name, author-last-name, and author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name et al. year)
%             (author-last-name)
%             author-last-name (year)
%             (author-last-name and author-last-name)
%             (author-last-name et al.)
%             (year) or (year,year)
%             year or year,year
%
%   Reference list ordering: alphabetical by author or whatever passes
%    for author in the absence of one.
%
% This BibTeX style has support for abbreviated author lists and for
%    year-only citations.  This is done by having the citations
%    actually look like
%
%    \citeauthoryear{full-author-info}{abbrev-author-info}{year}
%
% The LaTeX style has to have the following (or similar)
%
%     \let\@internalcite\cite
%     \def\fullcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##1, ##3}\@internalcite}
%     \def\fullciteA{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##1}\@internalcite}
%     \def\shortcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##2, ##3}\@internalcite}
%     \def\shortciteA{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##2}\@internalcite}
%     \def\citeyear{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##3}\@internalcite}
%
% These TeX macro definitions are found in chicago.sty. Additional
% commands to manipulate different components of a citation can be defined
% so that, for example, you can list author's names without parentheses
% if using a citation as a noun or object in a sentence.
%
% This file was originally copied from newapa.bst at ymir.claremont.edu.
%
% Features of chicago.bst:
% =======================
%
% - full names used in citations, but abbreviated citations are available
%   (see above)
% - if an entry has a "month", then the month and year are also printed
%   as part of that bibitem.
% - all conjunctions use "and" instead of "\&"
% - major modification from Chicago Manual of Style (13th ed.) is that
%   only the first author in a reference appears last name first-
%   additional authors appear as J. Q. Public.
% - pages are listed as "pp. xx-xx" in all entry types except
%   article entries.
% - book, inbook, and manual use "location: publisher" (or organization)
%   for address and publisher. All other types list publishers separately.
% - "pp." are used to identify page numbers for all entry types except
%   articles.
% - organization is used as a citation label if neither author nor editor
%   is present (for manuals).
% - "et al." is used for long author and editor lists, or when "others"
%   is used.
%
% Modifications and bug fixes from newapa.bst:
% ===========================================
%
%   - added month, year to bib entries if month is present
%   - fixed bug with In proceedings, added necessary comma after title
%   - all conjunctions changed to "and" from "\&"
%   - fixed bug with author labels in my.full.label: "et al." now is
%        generated when "others" is an author name
%   - major modification from Chicago Manual of Style (13th ed.) is that
%     only the first author in a reference appears last name first-
%     additional authors appear as J. Q. Public.
%   - pages are listed as "pp. xx-xx" in all entry types except
%     article entries. Unnecessary (IMHO) "()" around page numbers
%     were removed, and page numbers now don't end with a period.
%   - created chicago.sty for use with this bibstyle (required).
%   - fixed bugs in FUNCTION {format.vol.num.pages} for missing volume,
%     number, and /or pages. Renamed to format.jour.vol.
%   - fixed bug in formatting booktitles: additional period an error if
%     book has a volume.
%   - fixed bug: editors usually given redundant period before next clause
%     (format.editors.dot) removed.
%   - added label support for organizations, if both author and editor
%     are missing (from alpha.bst). If organization is too long, then
%     the key field is used for abbreviated citations.
%   - In proceedings or books of several volumes, no comma was written
%     between the "Volume x" and the page numbers (this was intentional
%     in newapa.bst). Fixed.
%   - Some journals may not have volumes/numbers, only month/year (eg.
%     IEEE Computer). Fixed bug in article style that assumed volume/number
%     was always present.
%
% Original documentation for newapa.sty:

% This version was made by modifying the master file made by
% Oren Patashnik (PATASHNIK@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU), and the 'named' BibTeX
% style of Peter F. Patel-Schneider.

%
% "Chicago" BibTeX style, chicago.bst
% ===================================
%
% BibTeX `chicago' style file for BibTeX version 0.99c, LaTeX version 2.09
% Place it in a file called chicago.bst in the BibTeX search path.
% You need to include chicago.sty as a \documentstyle option.
% (Placing it in the same directory as the LaTeX document should also work.)
% This "chicago" style is based on newapa.bst (American Psych. Assoc.)
% found at ymir.claremont.edu.
%
%   Citation format: (author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name and author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name, author-last-name, and author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name et al. year)
%             (author-last-name)
%             author-last-name (year)
%             (author-last-name and author-last-name)
%             (author-last-name et al.)
%             (year) or (year,year)
%             year or year,year
%
%   Reference list ordering: alphabetical by author or whatever passes
%    for author in the absence of one.
%
% This BibTeX style has support for abbreviated author lists and for
%    year-only citations.  This is done by having the citations
%    actually look like
%
%    \citeauthoryear{full-author-info}{abbrev-author-info}{year}
%
% The LaTeX style has to have the following (or similar)
%
%     \let\@internalcite\cite
%     \def\fullcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##1, ##3}\@internalcite}
%     \def\fullciteA{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##1}\@internalcite}
%     \def\shortcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##2, ##3}\@internalcite}
%     \def\shortciteA{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##2}\@internalcite}
%     \def\citeyear{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##3}\@internalcite}
%
% These TeX macro definitions are found in chicago.sty. Additional
% commands to manipulate different components of a citation can be defined
% so that, for example, you can list author's names without parentheses
% if using a citation as a noun or object in a sentence.
%
% This file was originally copied from newapa.bst at ymir.claremont.edu.
%
% Features of chicago.bst:
% =======================
%
% - full names used in citations, but abbreviated citations are available
%   (see above)
% - if an entry has a "month", then the month and year are also printed
%   as part of that bibitem.
% - all conjunctions use "and" instead of "\&"
% - major modification from Chicago Manual of Style (13th ed.) is that
%   only the first author in a reference appears last name first-
%   additional authors appear as J. Q. Public.
% - pages are listed as "pp. xx-xx" in all entry types except
%   article entries.
% - book, inbook, and manual use "location: publisher" (or organization)
%   for address and publisher. All other types list publishers separately.
% - "pp." are used to identify page numbers for all entry types except
%   articles.
% - organization is used as a citation label if neither author nor editor
%   is present (for manuals).
% - "et al." is used for long author and editor lists, or when "others"
%   is used.
%
% Modifications and bug fixes from newapa.bst:
% ===========================================
%
%   - added month, year to bib entries if month is present
%   - fixed bug with In proceedings, added necessary comma after title
%   - all conjunctions changed to "and" from "\&"
%   - fixed bug with author labels in my.full.label: "et al." now is
%        generated when "others" is an author name
%   - major modification from Chicago Manual of Style (13th ed.) is that
%     only the first author in a reference appears last name first-
%     additional authors appear as J. Q. Public.
%   - pages are listed as "pp. xx-xx" in all entry types except
%     article entries. Unnecessary (IMHO) "()" around page numbers
%     were removed, and page numbers now don't end with a period.
%   - created chicago.sty for use with this bibstyle (required).
%   - fixed bugs in FUNCTION {format.vol.num.pages} for missing volume,
%     number, and /or pages. Renamed to format.jour.vol.
%   - fixed bug in formatting booktitles: additional period an error if
%     book has a volume.
%   - fixed bug: editors usually given redundant period before next clause
%     (format.editors.dot) removed.
%   - added label support for organizations, if both author and editor
%     are missing (from alpha.bst). If organization is too long, then
%     the key field is used for abbreviated citations.
%   - In proceedings or books of several volumes, no comma was written
%     between the "Volume x" and the page numbers (this was intentional
%     in newapa.bst). Fixed.
%   - Some journals may not have volumes/numbers, only month/year (eg.
%     IEEE Computer). Fixed bug in article style that assumed volume/number
%     was always present.

        % The file btxbst.doc has the documentation for this style.
% The following text is the header for chicago.bst:
% "Chicago" BibTeX style, chicago.bst
% ===================================
%
% BibTeX `chicago' style file for BibTeX version 0.99c, LaTeX version 2.09
% Place it in a file called chicago.bst in the BibTeX search path.
% You need to include chicago.sty as a \documentstyle option.
% (Placing it in the same directory as the LaTeX document should also work.)
% This "chicago" style is based on newapa.bst (American Psych. Assoc.)
% found at ymir.claremont.edu.
%
%   Citation format: (author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name and author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name, author-last-name, and author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name et al. year)
%             (author-last-name)
%             author-last-name (year)
%             (author-last-name and author-last-name)
%             (author-last-name et al.)
%             (year) or (year,year)
%             year or year,year
%
%   Reference list ordering: alphabetical by author or whatever passes
%    for author in the absence of one.
%
% This BibTeX style has support for abbreviated author lists and for
%    year-only citations.  This is done by having the citations
%    actually look like
%
%    \citeauthoryear{full-author-info}{abbrev-author-info}{year}
%
% The LaTeX style has to have the following (or similar)
%
%     \let\@internalcite\cite
%     \def\fullcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##1, ##3}\@internalcite}
%     \def\fullciteA{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##1}\@internalcite}
%     \def\shortcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##2, ##3}\@internalcite}
%     \def\shortciteA{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##2}\@internalcite}
%     \def\citeyear{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##3}\@internalcite}
%
% These TeX macro definitions are found in chicago.sty. Additional
% commands to manipulate different components of a citation can be defined
% so that, for example, you can list author's names without parentheses
% if using a citation as a noun or object in a sentence.
%
% This file was originally copied from newapa.bst at ymir.claremont.edu.
%
% Features of chicago.bst:
% =======================
%
% - full names used in citations, but abbreviated citations are available
%   (see above)
% - if an entry has a "month", then the month and year are also printed
%   as part of that bibitem.
% - all conjunctions use "and" instead of "\&"
% - major modification from Chicago Manual of Style (13th ed.) is that
%   only the first author in a reference appears last name first-
%   additional authors appear as J. Q. Public.
% - pages are listed as "pp. xx-xx" in all entry types except
%   article entries.
% - book, inbook, and manual use "location: publisher" (or organization)
%   for address and publisher. All other types list publishers separately.
% - "pp." are used to identify page numbers for all entry types except
%   articles.
% - organization is used as a citation label if neither author nor editor
%   is present (for manuals).
% - "et al." is used for long author and editor lists, or when "others"
%   is used.
%
% Modifications and bug fixes from newapa.bst:
% ===========================================
%
%   - added month, year to bib entries if month is present
%   - fixed bug with In proceedings, added necessary comma after title
%   - all conjunctions changed to "and" from "\&"
%   - fixed bug with author labels in my.full.label: "et al." now is
%        generated when "others" is an author name
%   - major modification from Chicago Manual of Style (13th ed.) is that
%     only the first author in a reference appears last name first-
%     additional authors appear as J. Q. Public.
%   - pages are listed as "pp. xx-xx" in all entry types except
%     article entries. Unnecessary (IMHO) "()" around page numbers
%     were removed, and page numbers now don't end with a period.
%   - created chicago.sty for use with this bibstyle (required).
%   - fixed bugs in FUNCTION {format.vol.num.pages} for missing volume,
%     number, and /or pages. Renamed to format.jour.vol.
%   - fixed bug in formatting booktitles: additional period an error if
%     book has a volume.
%   - fixed bug: editors usually given redundant period before next clause
%     (format.editors.dot) removed.
%   - added label support for organizations, if both author and editor
%     are missing (from alpha.bst). If organization is too long, then
%     the key field is used for abbreviated citations.
%   - In proceedings or books of several volumes, no comma was written
%     between the "Volume x" and the page numbers (this was intentional
%     in newapa.bst). Fixed.
%   - Some journals may not have volumes/numbers, only month/year (eg.
%     IEEE Computer). Fixed bug in article style that assumed volume/number
%     was always present.

% chicago.sty: Style file for use with bibtex style chicago.bst, for
% bibliographies formatted according to the 13th Edition of the Chicago
% Manual of Style.
%
% 'newapa.bst' was made from 'plain.bst', 'named.bst', and 'apalike.bst',
% with lots of tweaking to make it look like APA style, along with tips
% from Young Ryu and Brian Reiser's modifications of 'apalike.bst'.
% newapa.sty formed the basis of this style, chicago.sty. Author-date
% references in newapa.bst formed the basis for chicago.bst. Chicagoa.bst
% supports annotations.
%
% Version 4 (August, 1992):
% - fixed chicago.bst and chicagoa.bst to handle long author lists in
%   sorting
% - fixed chicago.bst and chicagoa.bst so that missing page numbers in
%   ``article'' entries are handled correctly
% - modified chicago.sty to format entries with 2nd and subsequent lines
%   indented.
%
%   Citation format: (author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name and author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name et al. year)
%             (author-last-name)
%             author-last-name
%             author-last-name (year)
%             (author-last-name and author-last-name)
%             (author-last-name et al.)
%             (year) or (year,year)
%             year or year,year
%
%   Reference list ordering: alphabetical by author or whatever passes
%    for author in the absence of one.
%
% This BibTeX style has support for abbreviated author lists and for
%    year-only citations.  This is done by having the citations
%    actually look like
%
%    \citeauthoryear{full-author-info}{abbrev-author-info}{year}
%
% The LaTeX style has to have the following (or similar)
%
%     \let\@internalcite\cite
%     \def\fullcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##1, ##3}\@internalcite}
%     \def\fullciteA{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##1}\@internalcite}
%     \def\shortcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##2, ##3}\@internalcite}

%
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This file implements citations for the ``chicago'' bibliography style.
%  Place it in a file called chicago.sty in the TeX search path.
%(Placing it in the same directory as the LaTeX document should also work.)
%
%    This file is a modification of the ``newapa'' LaTeX style,
%    originally adapted by Steven Spencer from the ``apalike'' LaTeX style.
%    It was originally modified by Stephen N. Spencer, with further
%    modifications by Young U. Ryu.
%
% The ``chicago'' BibTeX bibliography style creates citations with labels:
%       \citeauthoryear{author-info}{abbrev. author-info}{year}
%
% These labels are processed by the following LaTeX commands:
%
%  \cite{key}
%    which produces citations with full author list and year.
%    eg. (Brown 1978; Jarke, Turner, Stohl, et al. 1985)
%  \citeNP{key}
%    which produces citations with full author list and year, but without
%    enclosing parentheses:
%    eg. Brown 1978; Jarke, Turner and Stohl 1985
%  \citeA{key}
%    which produces citations with only the full author list.
%    eg. (Brown; Jarke, Turner and Stohl)
%  \citeANP{key}
%    which produces citations with only the full author list, without
%    parentheses eg. Brown; Jarke, Turner and Stohl
%  \citeN{key}
%    which produces citations with the full author list and year, but
%    can be used as nouns in a sentence; no parentheses appear around
%    the author names, but only around the year.
%      eg. Shneiderman (1978) states that......
%    \citeN should only be used for a single citation.
%  \shortcite{key}
%    which produces citations with abbreviated author list and year.
%  \shortciteNP{key}
%    which produces citations with abbreviated author list and year.
%  \shortciteA{key}
%    which produces only the abbreviated author list.
%  \shortciteANP{key}
%    which produces only the abbreviated author list.
%  \shortciteN{key}
%    which produces the abbreviated author list and year, with only the
%    year in parentheses. Use with only one citation.
%  \citeyear{key}
%    which produces the year information only, within parentheses.
%  \citeyearNP{key}
%    which produces the year information only.
%
% Abbreviated author lists use the ``et al.'' construct.
%
% `NP' means `no parentheses'.
%
% This LaTeX style file must be used with the ``chicago'' or ``chicagoa''
% (annotated chicago style) BibTeX styles.

%hum2.sty: Style file for use with bibtex style hum2.bst, for
%bibliographies formatted according the handbook of the Modern Language
%Association (MLA) and citations of the form footnote(Author, Title,
%Page).  Repeated Author/Title will be replaced with Ibid.  In addition,
%the article will be doublespaced and margins will be set to 1" standard.
%
%The following packages must be used in addition to hum2.sty:
%	ifthen.sty
%	doublespace2.sty
%
%This file is a jury-rig of the chicago bst and sty files.  It utilizes
%the fact that chicago.bst passes two types of author fields to the
%citation command:  full and abbreviated.  hum2 replaces the full author
%field with the title (see below for important .bib note) and reformats
%the \cite command (see the bottom of hum2.sty).
%
%IMPORTANT NOTICE
%You must enclose your title in braces in your .bib file, ie,
%	title = "{My Book of Computers}",
%
%IMPORTANT NOTICE
%You need to replace (or start using) the command \note instead of \cite
%(see next notice for format).
%
%IMPORTANT NOTICE
%You must pass two commands to \note: first the page number and then the
%citation key.  If you do not have a page number, give 'nopage' as the
%first option, ie,
%	So she said ``okay.''\cite{nopage}{aB99}  Then it
%	hit\cite{pages~12--13}{cD88}.
%
%
%Details:  it assumes you want a first page numbered 0.  Reset
%counter page to 1 if this is not the case.  If all you want are the
%citations, the important modifications are the first two lines (\cite
%and \citeNP) and last three lines (\newcommand, \newboolean, and
%\newcommand{\note}).  (In fact, I don't know everything that the rest
%of the old chicago.sty file is doing, and didn't change it.)

% chicago.sty: Style file for use with bibtex style chicago.bst, for
% bibliographies formatted according to the 13th Edition of the Chicago
% Manual of Style.
%
% 'newapa.bst' was made from 'plain.bst', 'named.bst', and 'apalike.bst',
% with lots of tweaking to make it look like APA style, along with tips
% from Young Ryu and Brian Reiser's modifications of 'apalike.bst'.
% newapa.sty formed the basis of this style, chicago.sty. Author-date
% references in newapa.bst formed the basis for chicago.bst. Chicagoa.bst
% supports annotations.
%
% Version 4 (August, 1992):
% - fixed chicago.bst and chicagoa.bst to handle long author lists in
%   sorting
% - fixed chicago.bst and chicagoa.bst so that missing page numbers in
%   ``article'' entries are handled correctly
% - modified chicago.sty to format entries with 2nd and subsequent lines
%   indented.
%
%   Citation format: (author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name and author-last-name year)
%             (author-last-name et al. year)
%             (author-last-name)
%             author-last-name
%             author-last-name (year)
%             (author-last-name and author-last-name)
%             (author-last-name et al.)
%             (year) or (year,year)
%             year or year,year
%
%   Reference list ordering: alphabetical by author or whatever passes
%    for author in the absence of one.
%
% This BibTeX style has support for abbreviated author lists and for
%    year-only citations.  This is done by having the citations
%    actually look like
%
%    \citeauthoryear{full-author-info}{abbrev-author-info}{year}
%
% The LaTeX style has to have the following (or similar)
%
%     \let\@internalcite\cite
%     \def\fullcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##1, ##3}\@internalcite}
%     \def\fullciteA{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##1}\@internalcite}
%     \def\shortcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##2, ##3}\@internalcite}
%     \def\shortciteA{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##2}\@internalcite}
%     \def\citeyear{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2##3{##3}\@internalcite}
%
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This file implements citations for the ``chicago'' bibliography style.
%  Place it in a file called chicago.sty in the TeX search path.
%(Placing it in the same directory as the LaTeX document should also work.)
%
%    This file is a modification of the ``newapa'' LaTeX style,
%    originally adapted by Steven Spencer from the ``apalike'' LaTeX style.
%    It was originally modified by Stephen N. Spencer, with further
%    modifications by Young U. Ryu.
%
% The ``chicago'' BibTeX bibliography style creates citations with labels:
%       \citeauthoryear{author-info}{abbrev. author-info}{year}
%
% These labels are processed by the following LaTeX commands:
%
%  \cite{key}
%    which produces citations with full author list and year.
%    eg. (Brown 1978; Jarke, Turner, Stohl, et al. 1985)
%  \citeNP{key}
%    which produces citations with full author list and year, but without
%    enclosing parentheses:
%    eg. Brown 1978; Jarke, Turner and Stohl 1985
%  \citeA{key}
%    which produces citations with only the full author list.
%    eg. (Brown; Jarke, Turner and Stohl)
%  \citeANP{key}
%    which produces citations with only the full author list, without
%    parentheses eg. Brown; Jarke, Turner and Stohl
%  \citeN{key}
%    which produces citations with the full author list and year, but
%    can be used as nouns in a sentence; no parentheses appear around
%    the author names, but only around the year.
%      eg. Shneiderman (1978) states that......
%    \citeN should only be used for a single citation.
%  \shortcite{key}
%    which produces citations with abbreviated author list and year.
%  \shortciteNP{key}
%    which produces citations with abbreviated author list and year.
%  \shortciteA{key}
%    which produces only the abbreviated author list.
%  \shortciteANP{key}
%    which produces only the abbreviated author list.
%  \shortciteN{key}
%    which produces the abbreviated author list and year, with only the
%    year in parentheses. Use with only one citation.
%  \citeyear{key}
%    which produces the year information only, within parentheses.
%  \citeyearNP{key}
%    which produces the year information only.
%
% Abbreviated author lists use the ``et al.'' construct.
%
% `NP' means `no parentheses'.
%
% This LaTeX style file must be used with the ``chicago'' or ``chicagoa''
% (annotated chicago style) BibTeX styles.

Hi

Nobody seems to be responding to your query so I'll take a stab at it. 
Warning, I have not used the ppchtex package so the following is just
from a bit of reading. :-)

The Latex Graphics Companion by Goossens, Rahtz, and Mittelbach, on
pages 228 to 228 discusses the ppchtex package. There is also a manual
at
	
http://www.frontiernet.net/~cdm/age1.html 

> how to center an molecular display ?

That seems straightforward. The first thing I would try would be to put
it between a \begin{center} and \end{center}.

AS to the details of the \chemical parameters, I would start with
something like
	\chemical[SIX,B1,B2,B3,B4,B5,B6]
which should give a plain 6-membered ring. I would then try
	\chemical[SIX,B1..6]
which should do the same. I would then try
	\chemical[SIX,B1..B6][CH_3]
which I would expect to add a methyl group. I would then continue
stepwise until I got the feel of what happens. (I got those first three
examples from Goossens et al, pages 23 and 24.

(I could not try these out since SuSE decided not to supply
m-chemic.sty  :-(  and I am a tad short on time.)

Hope this helps you get started.

Thanks douglas i used some protein examples (desoxyribonucliec acid) and try to center using \begin{center}... but it
doesn't work, so have to exist some command like \centering to put the molecular strtuce centered in the page, at all
thanks really thank sby your answer, about your time don't worry this is a group list nobody has the obligation to do
something, a simple help is trtmendous (docs, tutorials and etc).

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Finally after Douglas Waud had answered my e-mail i founded, following his indication the following link:
http://www.pragma-ade.com/general/manuals/mp-ch-en.pdf
or for FreeBSD users with LaTeX installed:
/usr/local/share/texmf/doc/context/ppchtex/mp-ch-en.pdf 
(I've discovered after founded the doc, because i don't founded the ppchtex in ports, so i tried to find them installed
on my system)

This docs describe How-To use the package ppchTeX -- a macro-package for typesetting chemical structures formulas.
I've don't finished to read the docs, but it's look to solve my problem, if anyone find something else please still
answering using [OFF-TOPIC]  on subject, because believe on me find this kind of specialized information isn't easy.
I've find the Japanese package xymtex:
http://ctex.myrice.com/document/packages/math/xymtex.htm
if someone knows Japanese well and want to translate to us, we will enjoy 8-).

try \leavevmode before the code for the chemistry

re. \begin{center} vs. \centering --

use \begin{center} in text (diagram used in the same way that display
maths)

use \centering (with \leavevmode, if you're using a non-latex package
like ppchtex) if you're inside a \begin{figure}...\end{figure}

xymtex (possibly not the latest version) is available on ctan, and
there's documentation (in english, dvi format) in its doc200
subdirectory.

Possible on a letter-by-letter basis in pdftex by tweaking a virtual
font. Sketchy example for making a randomly colored cmr10 clone:

Start from cmr10.tfm, put this into some working directory. Then:

$ tftopl cmr10.tfm > cmr10.pl
$ cp cmr10.pl cmrcolor10.vpl

Now in the file cmrcolor10.vpl change

  (FAMILY CMR)
into
  (FAMILY CMRCOLOR)

and just before the 1st line

  (CHARACTER O 0

in cmrcolor10.vpl add a line

(MAPFONT D 0 (FONTNAME cmr10))

so that the cmrcolor10.vpl references cmr10.tfm as real font.

Then do

$ vptovf cmrcolor10.vpl

which creates
  cmrcolor10.tfm
  cmrcolor10.vf

Then do

$vftovp cmrcolor10.vf > cmrcolor10.vpl

which re-creates
   cmrcolor10.vpl

Now you have reached the first goal: A cmrcolor10.vpl file ready for
your tweaking. Then you can add funny pdfTeX specials e. g. by some awk
script:

$ export LANG="C" ; awk -f addspecial.awk cmrcolor10.vpl > temp
$ mv temp cmrcolor10.vpl

where the addspecial.awk looks like:

#begin of addspecial.awk
/SETCHAR/{
  r = 0.6 * rand();
  g = 0.6 * rand();
  b = 0.6 * rand();
  printf("      (SPECIAL PDF: %f %f %f rg)\n", r, g, b);
  print $0;
  printf("      (SPECIAL PDF: %f %f %f rg)\n", 1, 1, 1);
  next;
}
//{print}
#end of addspecial.awk

Then do again

$ vptovf cmrcolor10.vpl

This creates the working versions
  cmrcolor10.tfm
  cmrcolor10.vf

Now you can call the colored font e. g. from the following tex file:

\font\cmrcolor cmrcolor10 at 10pt
\cmrcolor
\input tufte
\bye

Don't look into the pdf file: This method is rather "expensive" :-)

Actually it's easy:

\input color.tex \textcolor{red}{Hi} \bye

Then: tex -> dvips
