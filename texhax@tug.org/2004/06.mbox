Howdy,

I have been frustrated in trying to figure out how I can create my own 
accents that work in math mode in LaTeX. Specifically, I am trying to 
put a double grave or double acute accent on top of a greek symbol in 
math mode.

Anyone know how to do this?

I have zero experience with LaTeX-HTML interaction matters, but you may
want to look at thier overview in

	A Brief Guide to LaTeX for Web Publishing
	by Peter R. Wilson
	(file <webguide.pdf> in your TeX distribution)

An interesting option seems to be TeX4ht: LaTeX and TeX for Hypertext
(file <tex4ht/mn.html> or see

	The LaTeX Web Companion
	at http://cseng.aw.com

Luck,

Yes, I have tried the accents package. 

Perhaps I should have been more clear, but I want the double accents, say
the grave accent twice, side by side like a \ddot on top of a greek symbol
in math mode.

Message-ID: <40BD8C61.5040206@us.es>

Dear Sir or Madam:

First of all I would like to apoligice in advance because I do not know 
if this is the right address to make a Latex question. I hope it is.

I'm a Latex-WinEdt user from the University of Seville and lately I'm 
having a problem when compiling I hadn't had before. The thing is that I 
cannot view the figures I want. I normally save them as .bmp files, and 
when compiling the Latex compilator says that the file .bb  has not been 
found, what does it mean?

For instance: if I write a code like this

\usepackage{graphicx} % in the preamble

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=15cm, height=15cm]{metro_sevilla.bmp}
\end{center}
\caption{\ Future Sevilla Underground. \label{figura_metro}}
\end{figure}

the compiler would say:

Latex error: File 'metro_sevilla.bb' not found. And after pressing 
"enter" it would say that it cannot determine the size of the file 
'metro_sevilla.bmp'.

I have asked and I really don't know what to do. Could you please help me?

Sincerely,

Federico Perea.

You might look at hyperlatex, which I think is the best solution (which
is why I became its maintainer).  Its two drawbacks are that it is not
a general-purpose solution, though it is very good in the context of a
specific document, and that it depends on the emacs editor.  There are
emacs releases for windows, but I am not familiar with them.

Is there a package I'm not finding?

No, what I need is a ``glob'' of text which hangs off of (say) the top 
half of a displayed fraction and explains it.

Yeah, should've been specific, sorry.

Hmm, that does work in math. Okay, it's good except that it wants a 
size up-front... guess I'll need to calculate that.

Thanks!

Lessee how this goes, maybe I'll have something presently ;)

Using LiveTex and WinEdt on a Windows machine.

I am trying to import a dot-chart from R (a statitics package).  I
create the graph in R and save it as a .ps file, thus

 dotchart(freqrelig[order(freqrelig)],          #PLOT IN ORDER OF FREQ

When I run it through LaTeX, I get no errors, and when I view it in PDF
(after using PDFLaTeX) it looks fine.  But in dvi preview, the chart is
overlaid with a bunch of letters and numbers, making it unreadable.

Other graphs in the same document appear fine.

I looked in the Guide to LaTeX, and the LaTeX graphics companion, but

Gentlemen,

I would like to thank Peter Zimmerman and Pavel Minev Penev for providing
solutions. 

I am surprised that a solution such as that given by Pavel is not included
in the accents package by default. I believe that such package should
include the \dgrave (double grave) and \dacute (double acute) accents just
as it includes \ddot. Perhaps even better would be if \accentset would allow
multiple grave or acute accent characters to be included. Perhaps this can
be done, but I haven't been able to figure it out.

I would expect that. A dviviewer is just that; it talks dvi but not ps.
As they say in Maine, "You can't get there from here."

You say it works ok with pdflatex, which implies it is PDF, despite the
type="ps".  Indeed, such a graphic cannot be previewed in DVI mode (when
you run with latex).

If you can get R to generate an EPS file, then that should work with
latex + dvi.

R generates EPS files, even though the R documentation mostly refers
to them as PS files.

And this does work with some DVI viewers.  Xdvi, for example, has no
trouble displaying R-generated PS files brought in with
\includegraphics, though you can tell the software deals with
postscript more or less under protest, since certain features don't
work.  But I don't use the Win software, and apparently that's what's
at issue.  

Is there a different place Peter could ask about DVI viewer shortcomings?

Thanks to all who responded.

With their help (and that of the LaTeX graphics companion) I have
isolated the problem: It appears related only to the DVI driver.  I
tried different driver options, none are satisfactory (although they
fail on different graphs).  PDF files appear to be fine, so I am
sticking with them for now.

However, it would be nice if the DVI viewer worked properly, for two
reasons: First, especially as a newbie, I do a lot of drafts, and the
DVI comes on screen noticeably faster than the PDF files.  Second, some
coauthor may prefer something other than PDF files, since they seem to
be a lot smaller.  The MIS people where I work also frown on sending and
receiving large files via e-mail, and some of the PDF files are already
getting big.

Thanks again, and, if anyone has more info, I would appreciate it

I believe it does. It views dvi files. That was what it was designed to do.

That is because it is easier to deal with just the one type file.
(See also comments below on a practical work-around.)

Again, the dvi format was designed to deal just with text (more 
generally boxes into which letters could fit). Thus it is really "lean 
and mean" which probably reflects to some extent it's origin in an age 
when one had to use slow computers etc.

I also don't see why any coauthor would want a pdf file as a starting 
point. Would the .tex source not be the right one to exchange? You could 
also send the separte eps files but one of the team could assume 
reponsibility for placement during the formative phase.

You can't have cake and eat it too. Once you open the door to graphics 
you have to expect more complexity.

dvi files have the \special escape hatch so one can include instructions 
on how to deal, for example, with an eps file. However, dvi viewers will 
ignore those \special commands. On the other hand, another viewer can be 
designed to handle them. As Karl Berry indicated, some dvi viewers have 
been extended to do this. To go the next step, from ps to pdf you need a 
still more complex viewer. That is Acrobat (or other such program). 
However, the price you will pay is file size and time to load and 
display. Generally, I find that once I get one figure going ok, I can 
drop back and focus on the text and cycle through revisions of that with 
the dvi viewer and the assumption that the pictures will come out ok in 
the last round when I put out pdf with the pictures included. This will 
not help with your MIS people :-( ; I don't know how to deal with  their 
limit.

> Thanks again, and, if anyone has more info, I would appreciate it

As you have probably realized by now, that is not a safe statement to

I guess I was confused as to what dvi was supposed to do.  

As to why an coauthor would want a pdf file (instead of .tex).....some
of my coauthors do NOT use LaTeX.  And, since two of them are my bosses,
they get what they want.  (Word files, ideally for them, .rtf is OK). 
Another potential coauthor (if a grant I submitted gets funded) works on
Unix; I believe he would prefer .tex files to anything, but he can't
read .doc files.

*I* started getting into LaTeX because, 1) A lot of people who I
respect said it was WAY better than Word and 2)  In the same grant, some
of the formulas were not printing correctly when written in Word with
MathType.

So far, I agree that LaTeX is better than Word (although I am very new
to LaTeX, having installed it 10 days ago).  I haven't tried typesetting
really complex equations yet, but I hope they print right.

Thanks again

Postscript opens up the Pandora box: using the \special hack, you can do
lots of weird things that require a full PS interpreter to render. So you
should rather compare 'PDF rendering' with 'PS rendering'. DVI rendering is
fast as long as you stick to DVI and do not use any \special. One of the
hacks that it is (well almost) impossible to render with a dvi viewer
without resorting to full PS conversion is the one used by the 'psfrag'
package. 

If you are using TeXLive, you can have a look at the
.../texmf/doc/windvi/examples/wtest.dvi
.../texmf/doc/windvi/examples/wtest.tex
Files to see what the dvi viewer can do. Anything not in the range of the
example might be displayed incorrectly.

Use 3-pent\-a\-none in the text.  (Or make a macro that inserts it.)

<dangerous bend>
If there are many words like this, and thus it's not practical to insert
the hyphenations explicitly every time, I think you could disable
\hyphenchar for the main font, i.e.,
  \hyphenchar\font = -1 
as the first line after the \begin{document} (or maybe in the preamble,
I'm not sure).  Then I think \hyphenation{3-pent-a-none} would be active.
It will also disable breaks at any explicit hyphen!
(Anyway, I haven't tried it, and more would probably be needed; consider
it a starting clue, not a recipe.)


Inserting explicit hyphenation points is the way to go, if feasible.

Best,

The key notion here is that dvips is not a simple dvi viewer. It has 
been designed to take a dvi file with \specials to deal with the eps 
part and give and output which is ps. This can then be viewed by a 
viewer/printed which speaks ps. Dvi viewers do not.

In fact, the Graphics Companion's raison d'etre was to fill the gap left 
by the inability of a simple dvi file to deal with anything beyond 
graphics constructed from text characters such as with PicTex).

Perhaps this summary will help:

First generation	TeX/dvi
Second generation	dvips/ps
Third generation	acrobat/pdf

If you don't need graphics, then first generation works fine. If you 
want graphics, you have to decide between ps or jumping a generation 
directly to pdf. I have been trying to do the latter and have not yet 
come to regret it despite having invested a lot in the eps game. .

Both make sense. I traveled the same route!

I would be amazed if you had any trouble with math. That is where TeX 
excels.

I think you'll get the hang of TeX soon. Ten days is not much by way of 
on-job-training. :-)

Just to be pessimistic, I'll note that, in the long term, your problem 
will be to deal with colleagues bound to Word. First, they tend not to 
be able to see the difference between Word and a properly typeset 
output. :-(  Secondly, they have a major investment in Word and will be 
reluctant to give that up. Thus I suspect it will not be long before you 
will be asked to take your beautiful TeX/Latex  masterpieces and convert 
them to Word!  :-(.  The Taliban blowing up those Buddas in Afghanistan 
are not the only philistines out there!  :-)

Hang in there. Don't go over to the dark side!

The most reliable method is probably to use the babel approach. Here's a  
LaTeX solution:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[irish]{babel}
\makeatletter
\initiate@active@char{"}
\addto\extrasirish{\languageshorthands{irish}}
\addto\extrasirish{\bbl@activate{"}}
\addto\noextrasirish{\bbl@deactivate{"}}
\declare@shorthand{irish}{"-}{\nobreak-\bbl@allowhyphens}
\makeatother

\hyphenation{pent-a-none}

\begin{document}

\noindent Some text without particular meaning leading up to the
breakpoint: 3"-pentanone is hyphenated correctly.

The problem is the explicit hyphen, after which
TeX will not hyphenate further.  I would suggest
defining macros which generate "3-pentanone"
(visually) but which in practice generate
"3-\hskip 0 pt \relax pentanone"
which should be hyphenatable ...

\def \ThreeP {3-pentanone}
\def \threeP {3-\hskip 0 pt \relax pentanone}

\showhyphens {\ThreeP}
\showhyphens {\threeP}

\hyphenation {pent-a-none}

\showhyphens {\ThreeP}
\showhyphens {\threeP}

\end

Complex formulas are not more difficult to typeset with TeX than
simple ones.

If you have to typeset mathematics with LaTeX I recommend to
\usepackage{amsmath}.  This makes life much easier.  

The documentation should be part of the TeX distribution you use.
Look for a file "amsldoc.dvi" in ..../texmf/doc .  If it doesn't
exist, look for "amsldoc.ps" or "amsldoc.pdf".

BTW., the LaTeX Companion is now 10 years old but there is a new
edition which has been published a few weeks ago.  It is certainly
worth it's money.

Is there a program called "texdoctk" on your system?  It's a
documentation browser.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sure, this is the basic reason for \csname.

\def\makecmd#1{\expandafter\def\csname#1\endcsname{body}}

\makecmd{foo} then defines \foo to expand to "body".

(If you like \newcommand then add appropriate syntactic sugar.)

The french option chooses the Latin Modern fonts, so this might be a case  
of you not having them installed. You can do it with the MiKTeX Package  
Manager - find them under the name "lm". After installing you must run  
"updmap" from a command prompt.

This is abuse of the center environment. For a better way to do this, see

Good to see a complete example! :-)

Maybe something like:

\documentclass{minimal}

\newcommand*\DefineSomething[1]{%
   \expandafter\newcommand\csname first#1\endcsname[2]
     {\textbf{arg1: ##1}, arg2: ##2}%
   \expandafter\newcommand\csname second#1\endcsname[2][Empty]
     {\textbf{arg1: ##1}, arg2: ##2}%
}
%% notice the double hash marks above. We're one level down,
%% so they must be doubled.
\begin{document}
\DefineSomething{test}
\firsttest{A}{B} \par
\secondtest[optional]{A} \par
\secondtest{A}

Maybe the best choice for Windows users is TeXLive, see

      http://www.tug.org/texlive/

TeXLive is based on fptex, but it provides a lot of tools you
certainly need.

Subject: [texhax] Can you help?
Message-ID: <40c2ef38.7b2.0@iolfree.ie>

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Brian Hamilton. I live in Ireland.
For the last 20 years I have worked for a
typesetting company who worked solely for
Kluwer Academic Publishers. Because Kluwer
have transferred all their work to India I
have been made redundant. 

I have been trying to set a small business
from home. At the moment I am sending out
samples of my work. However, I have encountered
a problem which is baffeling me.

I am using TeX2k, and here is my problem.
When I latex a file I get superior characters
touching the characters they come after.
Also endnote and footnote symbols seem to be
too close and even touching the punctuation
that they come after. The funny thing is that
the occurrances are not consistent. The touching
does not happen everytime.

I asked my old company to latex a file for me and
there was no problem whatsoever. Is it possible to
replace my tex2k folder with the one from my company
run mktexlsr and fix the problem or is there just
one area in the tex2k folder that needs to be
updated. The tex2k folder is 90Mb+.

Any help would be much appreciated, however if you cannot
help is it possible to put me in touch with
some person who might?

I hope you do not mind me getting in touch with you this way.
It is my first venture into the business world and hopefully
I can make it work.

Regards and thanks in advance

Brian Hamilton

At present (as far as I know) most extras related to display math need
thought about sizing and positioning.  It would be interesting to see
some precise specs for things that should not be like that.

The more general idea is, I think, of a \parbox/minipage (or an LR
box?) where
  `the internal text width is set to some precalculated
   value based on the position of the `box' '.

And this is perhaps getting towards `the limits of TeX'; so there's a
challenging problem for someone's summer vacation!

Subject: [texhax] Question about caption package and esp. \captionof
Message-ID: <s0c432c7.012@MAIL.NDRI.ORG>

Hello again

Sorry to keep asking questions.....I do try to solve these on my own
before posting.....

Using LiveTex and WinEdt on a Windows machine.

I am having trouble with placement of floats, because I have a lot of
graphics in a document.  Then, in the LaTeX companion (2nd ed) I read
that a) This isn't uncommon and b) There is a package {caption} that can
put captions on nonfloating figures.  Seemed worth a shot.

So, in my preamble I put

\usepackage{caption}[2004/15/16]

and in my \mainmatter

\begin{center}
\fbox{\includegraphics[scale = .6]{pie}}\\
\captionof{figure}{Pie chart of race-ethnicity}
\label{F:pierace}
\end{center}

When I run it, I get an error that there is an undefined control
sequence

I checked the .pdf file for this package, but did not find anything
about such an error.

Any help, as always, appreciated

This is dirty but might do the job:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{empheq} % v2.0
\EmphEqInternalSyntaxOn
\def\EmphEqdisplaywidth{\l_empheq_displaywidth_dim}
\EmphEqInternalSyntaxOff
\begin{document}
\hrule
\begin{empheq}[
   left={\parbox[c][\EmphEqdisplayheight+\EmphEqdisplaydepth][t]
          {\linewidth-\EmphEqdisplaywidth-6cm}
          {Text spanning multiple lines}\quad}]
     {align}
   a&=\int_0^1 x\,dx +\frac{foo + bar}{baz}\\
   E&= mc^2
\end{empheq}
\end{document}

You might want to add an \fbox around \parbox for illustration purposes.

Yes, those two are a pain. It took me serious trouble to get empheq to  
work properly (I more or less think it does so now).

Maybe one could utilize \pdflastxpos et al. for this?

Sigh! Another one. My summer vacation is looking packed -- at this rate I

Of course, it would have helped if you had included the error message, but I
imagine it was

! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \includegraphics
                            [scale = .6]{pie}

If so, you need to put \usepackage{graphicx} in your preamble.

I also notice that you have \usepackage{caption}[2004/15/16], but there
aren't fifteen months in a year and, indeed, LaTeX warns

LaTeX Warning: You have requested, on input line 7, version
               `2004/15/16' of package caption,

\fbox puts TeX into Left-Right mode afaik, you can use a paragraph box:
\parbox{2in}{one\\two}
or a tabular environment like this:

\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\fbox{\parbox{5cm}{
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Office Use Only & {}\\
ID number: & 123\\
MCAT score: & 321\\
Undergraduate GPA: & ???
\end{tabular}
}}
\end{document}

This is odd because the folowing (snipped from your posting) works for me
(barring the missing pie file).

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{caption}[2004/15/16]
\begin{document}
\begin{center}
\fbox{\includegraphics[scale = .6]{pie}}\\
\captionof{figure}{Pie chart of race-ethnicity} \label{F:pierace}

Maybe you can include a _minimal_ example that gives the error.

I'm running Ghostview 4.6, with GhostScript just updated last week, on 
Win98 and MikTeX

Thanks.

PS--thanks for advice on my previous question about a frame box. 
Putting a parbox inside a framebox and using // to separate lines worked 
just right.

hello

Sorry if I missed this in faqs and googling:

- is there a way to nest \includes? I want to have a tree of files where
each includes only the files below it in a directory tree. At them
moment I have one big file of includes but I'd like to break these up.
Is this possible?

While we're on the subject of newbie qustions ...

> it's damnably difficult to find things in the uk faq.

I realise there was a certain amount of tongue-in-cheek there, but I also
wonder how many people are aware that there exists a downloadable pdf
version (indeed, it is part of the MiKTeX distro: e.g.,
...\texmf\doc\faq\english\newfaq.pdf) and also that the Adobe Reader does
have a simple (but very useful) word search facility (CTRL-F) - I use it all
the time.

In fact, while we're at it, I've been meaning to ask Robin if he did
something strange in producing the pdf version: after scrolling through one
or two found items in a search I always get the following message (Adobe
Reader 6.01):

"Because the document has been modified [sic] since it was last searched,
the search results are no longer valid. Would you like to repat the search?"

It's obviously absurd and answerng "no" allows the scrolling through the
results to continue.  Now although it's certain to be some bug in the Adobe
Reader, it's also true that I have never come across this error with any
other pdf document.

But Robin: please, don't waste too much time on it ;-)

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

If that's GhostScript 8.14, backlevel to 8.13.

It's 8.14.  It was doing the same thing before I upgraded--that was 
8.00.  Do you think 8.13 will behave differently?  I'd be willing to try 
it . . . .

In that case, no. I never had my similar (but slightly different) problem
before 8.14 and reverting to 8.13 cured it.

All I can suggest now is to uninstall and reinstall GSview and Ghostscript,
with a reboot inbetween as an added measure, and see if that cleans up
whatever the problem is, which may lie in an ini file and/or registry entries
and just may not be fixable any other way. Only once since GSview 2.xx have I
had to do that, but that one time it was the only thing that worked.

As of less than one minute ago, http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html lists
8.14 as the current AFPL version, 8.01 as the current GNU version. Do the
betas now have compiled binaries for Win98?

drives me up the wall.  desperately slow in ar5, takes an age to
initialise in ar6.  mind you, my fastest machine is 700mhz...

the only strange thing i do is thumbpdf (with some help from heiko

ordinary: the weird stuff is done before the final pdflatex run.

i tried compiling with the most recent pdftex beta i have compiled
(1.11c-beta-20040208) and couldn't repeat your experience with ar5 (unix
and widnoze) or ar6 (widnoze, on my slowest -- 400mhz -- machine).

> But Robin: please, don't waste too much time on it ;-)

more fun than writing the stuff, that's for sure.

unless something changes pretty soon, it's unlikely the next version
will be compiled using a 2004 pdftex, but it would be nice to hear how
you get on with the next version.

Are you sure you're creating the ps with dvips -t letter (or the default set
to letter) ghostview 8.13 appears to reset itself according to the paper
size the document declares, though 8.124 appears not to (I've just this
minute upgraded to make the comparison).

However, if in 8.14 I select "letter" (Media menu) and then hit "save
settings now" (Options menu) then the option remains.  Moreover, having put
the letter option in my LaTeX file (\documentclass[letter]{article}) and
used dvips -t letter the page always appears correctly in the GhostView
window, only the bounding box is A4 if A4 is selected in the GhostView Media
menu.

On my 900MHz it took 6 seconds to get the list for \include out of
newfaq.pdf; so, it's still got to be smidgeon quicker than posting texhax,
no ;-?

don't use $$ in amsmath; use the amsmath \tag command:

\[ \mathrm{\dot{H} + O_2 \rightarrow \dot{O}H + O } \tag{\eqref{key}} \]

Without AMS Math, \eqno command can replace \tag, meaning
\eqno{(\ref{key})} can accomplish the same results as above.

Subject: [texhax] Extending babel's vocabulary from a document class?
Message-ID: <40CEF438.4010401@ing.hj.se>

Hi.

I'm writing a small document class for LaTeX, extending article, that I 
want to be able to handle both english and swedish. Babel translates 
things like \tableofcontents and \listoffigures, but not, for instance, 
\lstlistoflistings from the 'listings' package. I can fix it by adding 
stuff like

  \def\lstlistingname{Kodlistning}%
  \def\lstlistlistingname{Kodlistningar}%

to the file swedish.ldf, but I'd rather handle it in my class using 
something like this:

Can that be done? I'm not familiar with any babel-API, if there is one...

Subject: [texhax] Syriac typesetting?
Message-ID: <1087323711.4554.35.camel@atlas>

Hello everyone,

I've been a casual user of TeX for a while and a lurker on this list for
some time.  I've used LaTeX to write design documents at work, but
that's about it.  This fall, I'm leaving my programming job to go back
to school and get a doctorate in Semitic Languages and Literature,
specializing in Syriac.  Consequently, I'm interested in using TeX to
write papers in English but incorporating several other alphabets:
primarily Syriac, but Hebrew, Coptic and Arabic could conceivably all be
combined in one paper as well.

My question: is this currently possible with TeX?  Based on my research,
there used to be a nice looking package called Sabra for Syriac
typesetting, but I haven't been able to find a recent copy and it was
supposed to be replaced by Omega anyway.  Does anyone know if Omega has
in fact succeeded in duplicating Sabra's functionality?  I've used the
Omega-based Makor2 package for Hebrew and liked it, but I'm dashed if I
can figure out how to make Syriac work.

I am also aware that Omega 2 is scheduled to be released this fall,
right around when I go back to school.  Does anyone know where I can get
more advance information about the capabilities they've been able to
work into this second release?  It would be nice to know I have a system
to write my papers with before I actually get immersed in the schoolwork
. . .

Thanks to anyone who can help me out here!

Well, if you're willing to use a Mac, XeTeX, ``just works'' for any 
language supported by Mac OS X.

http://scripts.sil.org/xetex

There should be some papers published on Omega 2 in the near future 
though.

when i first got back here (after my programming job disappeared under
my feet) there was a man completing a phd dissertation on syriac
typesetting.  it will certainly be possible to dig out a copy of the
dissertation (we typically send out pdfs, scanned in the case of
something that old); but i may manage something more concrete about the
work (there's an awful lot of departed users' stuff spinning on the
discs here).

i've been an enthusiast for omega since i first heard about it in the
early-ish 90s, and i still don't really understand how the current
offerings work.  (doesn't help that i've no real call for omega in my
day to day support work.)

let's hope the new one comes with more coherent documentation.  i don't
see papers in the upcoming preprints for this year's conference.  :-(

(what were you thinking of, william? -- i don't see anything in the
directory.)

i'll get back to you if i can dig out the dissertation, at least.
librarian's been off sick today, so there may be a delay.

Specify the languages as global options in \documentclass. However this  
always give you Swedish as your main language. If this is not desireable  
you could add the line
   \let\setmainlanguage\main@language
to your class file, so that you have a user command. Also in English you  
should have the strings for \lst...name like in this complete example:

\begin{filecontents}{CTclass.cls}

\RequirePackage[swedish]{babel}
\let\setmainlanguage\main@language
\addto\captionsswedish{%
   \def\lstlistingname{Kodlistning}%
   \def\lstlistlistingname{Kodlistningar}%
}
\LoadClass[a4paper]{article}% just for illustrating...
\end{filecontents}
\documentclass[english]{CTclass}
\usepackage{listings}
\setmainlanguage{english}
\addto\captionsenglish{%
   \def\lstlistingname{Listing}%
   \def\lstlistlistingname{Listings}%
}
\begin{document}
\chaptername, \lstlistingname, text in English

\selectlanguage{swedish}

\selectlanguage{english}

I'd thought that there was to be a paper at Euro TeX 2004 directly 
preceding the release of Omega 2.

There are some articles on Omega in the weird preprints, but not 
preprints for TUG2004.

The Omega site was recently up-dated, and I've seen two different user 
numbers (3 and 6) so there's something to look at there I'd think.

This is probably a simple matter, but I checked both the LaTeX

I know how to typeset a matrix using the matrix environment. What I'd
like to do is place expectation and variance operators (large E or V)
before the matrix.

Because his posting to texhax was a long time underway and he answered you  
on c.t.t. just before you sent this email. ;-)

Reminds me of a guy I helped with pctex (v4.something I think) at  
university two years ago. It did include the eps-files when the final  
output was set to postscript.

You don't say what platform you're running on, but in general you
(unfortunately) need to rebuild the file database.  Try running the
command mktexlsr.  If you're on a Windows or Mac, there's probably a GUI
way to do it.

the basic rotation command is \rotatebox from the graphics package.
(rotation is device-dependent, and tends not to show up in viewers.)

without more information about what you're trying to do, it's difficult
to offer more advice.

Message-ID: <759FE7DE-C310-11D8-9BBE-00039391146A@ics.mq.edu.au>

Hi everyone,

The MacTeX Working Group of TUG is compiling lists of links
to examples where TeX is integrated into a larger work-flow:

     http://www.tug.org/twg/mactex/realworld.html
	http://www.tug.org/twg/mactex/morerealworld.html

This is *not* meant to include traditional general-purpose
front-end editor-like TeX applications, such as WinEDT, TeXShell,
TeXShop, VTeX, Textures, OzTeX, etc.  which are listed aready at
  http://www.tug.org/interest.html.

Also, it doesn't include the obvious traditional application of
technical journals (esp. mathematics), though things like:
   *  online encyclopaedia
   *  abstract submission system with TeX preview
could be appropriate.


Furthermore, single documents which are particularly well-designed
and really show-off the power of TeX, are not what we are looking
for here. But these *would* be suitable candidates for inclusion
on the  `show-case' page:

     http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/


Please reply to either myself or:  mactex@tug.org
with suggestions ***including links***  for additions to any
of the above-mentioned lists.


Happy TeX-ing

The following command works fine for me when writing regular text:

Sorry if this is the wrong email address, but I am unable to find anywhere to

A friend of mine and I are graduate students and have both encountered a

close.  Open it later, then edit to add some code, then save and close again.

Off hand, this does not sound like a TeX/LaTeX issue. It seems more like 
some mix-up involving whatever editor you are using. You would have to 
give more information as to exactly what you are doing (operating 
system, TeX system, editor and the like) before anyone will be able to 
help you. Once you indicate what you are using someone familiar with 
that element would be more likely be able to provide some hint(s) as to 
what might be going on.

the tex faq addresses itself to tex-related questions only.  it also
discusses the mechanics of asking questions:

it's not clear that this is anything to do with tex.  this may simply be
because you're not describing your situation well.  however, program
edit-compile-debug cycles don't sound terribly tex-y to me.

a news group or mailing list appropriate to the editor you're using,
perhaps?

Subject: [texhax] A TeX `tools' bundle question.
Message-ID: <1087993242.99784e8capelian@drew.edu>

Hello TUG,

I'm trying to add the `tools' bundle to my LaTeX system.  One of the
instruction steps directs me to move all .sty and .tex files to "a directory
on LaTeX's standard input path."  Where exactly is that?  

I tried putting the files in a folder labelled `tools' in the texmf folder,
but that didn't work.  I'm just not sure where they belong...

Thanks for any help you can give!

I understand your point but unfortunately resorting to texlive under debian 
means to create some other problems with dependencies of other packages like 
Lyx, R, etc.

1) If you can, please write in English, you will generally get help much 
quicker.

2) Try the following:

latex rapport.tex
bibtex rapport

Depends on your LaTeX system.

Aha, is this MiKTeX?  If it is, why do it all by hand?

Try putting them in texmf\tex\latex\tools and then refreshing the filename database (this last step is VITAL) ... how you do this (aha, you guessed) depends on your LaTeX system.

noooo!!!

then it will fail to find rapport.aux.aux

the command is

  bibtex rapport

(and fwiw the .tex is unneccesary too:

  latex rapport

works, though it's not quite so clunky as bibtex about the extension
being there.)

Subject: [texhax] v1.1 of TeX Directory Structure document
Message-ID: <200406231733.i5NHX7N02209@f7.net>

After a lengthy review process, I've now released version 1.1 of the TeX
Directory Structure (TDS) document.

HTML: http://tug.org/tds/
PDF:  http://tug.org/tds/tds.pdf
DVI:  http://tug.org/tds/tds.dvi
sources and all output: ftp://tug.org/tex/tds/

It should propagate to CTAN (in the top-level tds directory) shortly.


Here is the summary of the non-editorial changes:

 * Inputs for TeX extensions included under `tex', instead of in their
   own top-level directories.

 * New top-level directory `scripts'.

 * New subdirectories `lig', `opentype', `truetype', and `type3' under `fonts'.

 * `enc', `lig', and `map' all use `SYNTAX/PACKAGE' subdirectories.

 * `pfm' files specified to go under `type1', and `inf' files under `afm'.

There is more information and rationale for each of these changes
cross-referenced in the document.


Happy TeX structuring,
Karl (on behalf of the TDS working group)

Not necessarily.  I just downloaded the iso image, mounted it under
</mnt/texlive/> and prepended "/mnt/texlive/bin/i386-linux" to the PATH
environment variable of the normal users (you don't want it for root,
since the `texinfo` for TeXlive seems not to be exactly compatible in
its options with the Debian one, so installing packages may lead to
strange errors).  Note that this will also make you use TeXlive's `info`
(which does not want to start in an xterm for not too good a reason).
To use your native `info` you may either play with your shell's `hash`
built-in, or maybe create a binaries directory somewhere, symlink only
what you like from </mnt/texlive/bin/i386-linux/> in it, and it to
users' PATH.

A sample from my </etc/profile>:

[-- Start </etc/profile> from line 18 to line 25: ---------------------]
# Overload executables for non-root users:
if [ "`id -u`" -ne 0 ]; then
	#TEXDIR="/usr/TeX"
	#TEXMFLOCAL="/usr/TeX/texmf-local"
	VARTEXMF="/usr/TeX/texmf-var"
	export TEXDIR TEXMFLOCAL VARTEXMF
	PATH="/mnt/texlive/bin/i386-linux:$PATH"
fi

It seems that you are using \documentclass{book} in which case
\tableofcontents is typeset on a \thispagestyle{plain} (like all chapter
title pages).  Of course, \thispagestyle{fancy} is not going to work
since you can execute it either before or after the table of contets has
been typeset (\tableofcontents is one command, isn't it?)  In short:
redefine the plain pagestyle (try \fancypagestyle{plain}{...} or
redefine \ps@plain, and/or read the documentation of fancyhdr).

See you,

Dear List,

Apologies if this is a bit off-topic. The question might belong in 
OpenOffice's mailing lists, but I suspect there's a better chance of getting 
it answered here than in those lists.

I'm creating tables in OpenOffice's Calc package and printing them to file as 
'.ps' for inclusion in a latex file. The images look ok on screen in the 
preview panel, and can also view them ok using Ghostscript. I'm using the 
graphicx package and -trying- to include the files with:

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{<filename>}

After LaTeX'ing the file, the page where the image should appear contains 
everything except the image. The image doesn't print at all on screen nor on 
hardcopy. I don't have any problems including '.ps' files produced from 
several other programs. For example, I have several figures produced in the 
statistics program R that appear fine both on screen and on paper. Have any 
OpenOffice users in the list experienced this and if so, have you found any 
solutions?

I'm using Linux Debian (hard disk installation of Knoppix 3.4), KDE desktop, 
TeTeX, and OpenOffice (1.1).

Thanks a lot in advance.

Sebastian

Hello again,

Sometime after sending my previous message it occurred to me to create a 
postscript file from the '.tex' file containing the postscript images I can't 
see in dvi format. Surprisingly, everything shows ok in the '.ps' produced 
file. Can anybody explain why some '.ps' or '.eps' images show ok on a dvi 
document and not others?, also why would postscript images not showing on dvi 
do show on postscript files? I'm baffled!

you don't in general _want_ "postscript" for inclusion in (la)tex
documents, since general postscript is not self-contained and can muck
things up in areas around it, quite apart from the sort of peculiarity
you're seeing.

does openoffice not offer "encapsulated postscript" (.eps) output?  if
it does, use that.  if it doesn't, either use the postscript output you
_do_ get, or investigate translation functions like those in gsview.

But then why do postscript images created in R are perfectly visible on the 
dvi file created by latex'ing the original '.tex' file?

I'm using the latest OOo version (1.1) and, at least in Calc, there's only an 
option to print to a postscript file. No 'eps', unfortunately.

Thanks for the suggestions.

i presume "r" (which i've never used) is _only_ producing images (rather
than complete documents, as oo is capable of), so confusingly creates
eps when it says it's producing ps.

sigh.  perhaps it feels it has to be grotty, since it's emulating m$
apps, and they don't typically get eps right...

Some programmes produce "good" postscript and some don't.

As Robin suggest, .eps is the form you should use.  If you can't produce
that with your particular application, you can try one of three things
(short of using a different programme):

1.  If available, output the images as .jpg and then use the convertor
jpeg2ps.

2.  Use Ghostview to convert to .eps (it's in the menu and there's also some
help).

3.  Open the .ps file with an ordinary text editor and check the header and
trailer lines; they should be something like

%!PS-Adobe-2.0

and

%%EOF

Anything else (especialy with funny control characters) can be safely
chopped - they are usually printer specific instructions (many, many Windogs
printer applications put them in).

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

I've not tried it myself, but couldn't you use ps2eps to create an EPS 
file from a PS one-pager?

cheers,
c.

Package: ps2eps
Version: 1.54-1
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.3.2.ds1-4), gs, perl
Description: Convert PostScript to EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files
  ps2eps is a tool to produce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF)
  from usual one-paged Postscript documents. It calculates correct
  Bounding Boxes for those EPS files and filters some special
  postscript command sequences that can produce erroneous results on
  printers.  EPS files are needed for including (scalable) graphics
  into TeX (or even Word) documents.  Other programs like ps2epsi do
  not calculate the bounding box always correct (because the values are
  put on the postscript stack which may get corrupted by bad postscript
  code) or rounded it off so that clipping the EPS cut off some part of
  the image. Therefore ps2eps uses a resolution of 144 dpi to get the
  correct bounding box.

Try saving your file in xls format and using gnumeric insteat of 
openoffice. gnumeric has a latex output and clear instructions in the file 
about how to include it, including the necessary preamble incantations. I 
find it works very well.

The lack of a bounding box specification was my first thought too.
But, I just tried it using OO 1.1 and making a ps file using print with
the print to file option, which created a ps file.
Including this file in tex using
   \includegraphics*[width=0.95\textwidth]{/tmp/f.ps}
worked fine.  I was, no doubt, just lucky that the table filled the page.
Checking with an editor, I found that there was indeed BoundingBox info in
the file.
 
I noticed that you can make a pdf file using export.  Maybe that would
help.
 
Good luck, Wes

So, initially you were not running dvips, but looking at the dvi file
"directly" using something like xdvi.  And you saw a blank page instead
of the OO produced table.
Now, you run dvips and look at the resulting ps file with something like
ghostscript.  And the table is there.
 
The obvious explanation is that xdvi (or whatever you are using) does not
interpret postscript as well as it should.
I just tried this and in xdvi I do see the OO produced table, but only very
briefly. So I guess the OO produced ps clears the page at the end (not
unreasonable if you are printing).  dvips seems smart enough to suppress
this.
 
Cheers, Wes

Hi,
You can use convert (Imagemagick) to interconvert various graphical
formats. For eg: ps to eps, jpg to png, png to eps, etc. Please see
convert man page for more details.

I can't speak to the rest of this topic, since I remain fairly
confused about it, too.  But I can confirm that while R *says* it
produces PS, it actually produces EPS files.  The R authors do admit
this, but they do it in an aside deep in the documentation. 

If anyone on the list wanted to clarify the distinction for the
benighted among us, I, for one, would be interested and grateful.

    as advised on your web site, I paid for the TUG membership so as to
    receive TexLive as a benefit of this membership.

Assuming you joined as a 2004 member, then you have a choice of receiving
the 2003 TeX Live right away, or waiting for the 2004 TeX Live.  TL'04
is not released yet, and there is no expected date at this point.
Not real soon.

If you want to get TL'03, instead of TL'04, write office@tug.org and
explain.  Robin (the TUG office manager) will be happy to send it to you.

    But I saw no sign of any LaTex editor yet.
    Is there a link from which I can download TexLive? 

You can download the ISO image for TL'03 from CTAN, in
/tex-archive/systems/texlive/Images.

    Should I expect to receive a CD by mail?

I surmise you selected to receive TL'04 on the membership form.  If
that's the case, yes, you'll receive TL'04 in the mail, when it's released.


HTH,

    since the `texinfo` for TeXlive seems not to be exactly compatible in
    its options with the Debian one, so installing packages may lead to
    strange errors).  

I assume you mean install-info.  Yes, unfortunately, no one (including
me) has yet unified the Texinfo and Debian install-info programs.  It's
a sad situation.

As far as I know, there are no serious compatibility issues with the
Texinfo language itself, or with the makeinfo or texinfo.tex or info
programs.  We've worked hard to keep them backwards-compatible for many
years now.

    Note that this will also make you use TeXlive's `info`
    (which does not want to start in an xterm for not too good a
    reason).

This I don't understand.  I have no problem running info in an xterm --
in fact, I've basically never run it any other way.  Can you send me the
error and any other information, off the list?  (Or to bug-texinfo@gnu.org.)

Thanks,

Thanks to all who responded. Here's a brief summary of what I could gather.

Apparently there are serious inconsistencies regarding what can be regarded as 
a postscript 'ps' file. Probably the safest option is to always use 'eps' 
instead of 'ps' when including images in LaTeX. One can use the exporting 
tools in the ghostview or ps2eps packages to do that. If that fails, print 
the whole LaTeX file directly to 'ps' using dvips.

LaTeX can read 'ps', but apparently not any. To ensure it can read it, 
intermediate steps were suggested, like producing a 'jpg' file and convert 
that to 'ps' with jpeg2ps (produces "correct" 'ps'?), and checking the header 
and trailer lines; they should read:

%!PS-Adobe-2.0

and

%%EOF

respectively, the rest can be chopped off (this wasn't the problem in my 
case).

In the particular case of making tables, GNUMERIC seems to be a good tool to 
get your table straight into LaTeX code. I've also heard of an add-in for MS 
Excel that can do that too.

Thanks again for all your suggestions.

Cheers
Sebastian

Yes. You will receive the 2004 TeX Live release when available (later in 
the summer we hope), unless, as Karl said, you'd rather receive TeX Live 
2003 instead. Just let me know. (TeX Live 2003 is available to purchase for 
$15, if want to go that route, and still receive TL2004). Please see: 
http://www.tug.org/join.html "Delivery of Benefits" for more information.

BTW, you should have received TUGboat 23.3-4 and 25.1. If you didn't 
receive copies of those for some reason, please let me know.

Thanks for checking.

What I do, and it has worked on several previous occasions with no
ill effects, is select any graph output, "copy" it to the scratch pad,
and then use the autopilot to open a "presentation" document.  Select
the simplest of all formats, and "paste" the image into that.  I seem to
recall that when you use print to file, or is it export, you get the
option of EPS.  I know I get it somehow, but I am on the wrong system 
to check it out.  

In any case, OO came to my rescue when I was suddenly confronted with
a Word document that had half a dozen Excel graphs in it.  The Word
document was 12 megabytes.  The extracted TeX was 300 Kb, and the
EPS files added up to 1.8 MB.  Rather an improvement, and the journal
came out satisfactorily.

A PS file describes one or more pages.  Here is a simple example:

----------------------------------
%!
/Palatino 50 selectfont
/inch { 72 mul } def
1 inch 1 inch moveto 2 inch 2 inch lineto 
5 setlinewidth stroke
showpage
100 200 moveto
(Hello) show
showpage
----------------------------------

You can send this file to a printer and whenever a "showpage" occurs,
a page is ejected.

The first line is mandatory.  Some programs (which do expect
PostScript input only) may work without it, but a printer needs it to
decide whether to treat it as a PS or plain ASCII file.

People sometimes do not want to print the whole document but only
particular pages.  This can be done by some PostScript code which
redefines showpage in such a way that it counts how often it is called
and behaves like showpage on the pages you want to print and like
erasepage on pages you want to omit.

This piece of code must be inserted at the begin of the document just
after the first line.

This is quite difficult and error-prone.  People want to extract pages
without dealing with PostScript code using external programs.

Therefore Adobe introduced the so-called "document structured
comments" (DSC).

Comments in PS look like comments in TeX, they also begin with a
percent character and the interpreter ignores everything until the end
of the line.

A DSC begins with two percent characters at the very beginning of a
line and may not contain arbitrary text.

Here is a very simplified example of the file using DSCs.  It doesn't
work, but shows the idea: 

----------------------------------
%!PS-Adobe-2.0
%%BeginProlog
/Palatino 50 selectfont
/inch { 72 mul } def
%%EndProlog
%%Page 1
1 inch 1 inch moveto 2 inch 2 inch lineto 
5 setlinewidth stroke
showpage
%%Page 2
100 200 moveto
(Hello) show
showpage
%%EOF
----------------------------------

A program can now extract a page without the need to understand
PostScript code.  It just has to understand the DSCs.  It's quite easy
to extract the content of a page now.  The stuff betweeen
%%BeginProlog and %%EndProlog is prepended to each set of pages
selected for printing.

BTW., the first line now describes the version number of the DSC
standard used in this document.

The example is too much simplified and wrong but you can get the
description at:

    http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5001.DSC_Spec.pdf


You now know what DSCs are, so we can discuss EPS.

Sometimes people want to create PostScript graphics and put them into
other documents.  Therefore Adobe invented the "Encapsulated
PostScript" standard.  An EPS file looks very similar to a PS file,
but there are some restrictions:

Obviously an EPS should describe a single page.  A PS file can
instruct a printer to select a particular paper tray.  Those
instrictions are disallowed in EPS files.

A program like TeX which wants to include a PostScript graphic must
know how large it is and where it is located.  PostScript does not
force people to place graphics at the origin of a page.

The EPS standard introduces a special DSC "%%BoundingBox"  which
provides the coordinates of the lower left and the upper right corner
of the graphic.

This is the most important thing of an EPS file.  It looks like:

%%BoundingBox: 20 25 122 200

You'll find a detailed description of the EPS standard at

    http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5002.EPSF_Spec.pdf

However, many programs provide a wrong BoundingBox.  Especially under
Widows it is quite unlikely that you get something useful.

Some programs produce usual PS files (one or more pages) and add a
comment like:

%%BoundingBox: 0 0 595 842

This is good for nothing, it just describes A4 paper.


LaTeX doesn't understand PostScript at all.  The command
\includegraphics{abc.ps} just causes LaTeX to read abc.ps and search
for a line beginning with %%BoundingBox.

It then inserts an empty box with the appropriate size to the document
to reserve space for the graphic.

The coordinates and the filename (and probably some information about
scaling) are put into the dvi file.

The only thing LaTeX is interested in is the %%BoundingBox comment.
Everything else has to be done by postprocessors like xdvi or dvips.

If you are interested in PostScript in general, I recommand the book
"PostScript by Example" by Henry McGilton and Mary Campione, Addison
Wesley 1992, ISBN 0-201-63228-4.

It provides a step-by-step introduction to PostScript.  It does not
even require that the reader knows what a programming language is.

Programmers might prefer the PostSript Language Reference Manual:

Hi,

What do you guys recommend me to do in order to include tiff figures in

(tiff2ps, gimp, Photoshop...), but the figures get very huge...

I am currently using dvipdf, but I'm looking forward to receiving

Leo,

You will get as many answers as there are people who try to do this
regularly. Here's mine:

> What do you guys recommend me to do in order to include tiff figures in

> (tiff2ps, gimp, Photoshop...), but the figures get very huge...

This is a bad idea (IMHO). There is no advantage to (e)ps here as the
original is a bitmap. If you want to insist on using an eps figure, I'd
suggest you convert it to a jpeg and use jpeg2ps (you might need to
fetch this from somewhere) to convert the jpeg to an eps. It turns out
that ps understands jpeg and jpeg2ps takes avantage of this to just wrap
the necessary postscript commands around the original jpeg, rather than
rendering it in ps (which is why your files end up so large). [I'm not a
graphics expert, so all the above explanation might be flawed, but not
too much I think/hope.]

Alternatively, convert the tiff to a bmp (using gimp, ...) which latex
understands. This has the advantage over jpeg in that it's loss-free.

> I am currently using dvipdf, but I'm looking forward to receiving
> sugestions.

If you want pdf output, my advice would be to use pdflatex instead. This
is my preferred route, with xpdf as my preferred previewer (acroread is
ok, but won't reload a document to the same page/magnification so it's a
bit less convenient). Of course (!) pdflatex and latex have virtually no
graphics formats in common (I assume you're using graphicx and
\includegraphics...). So...

Convert your tiffs to png format. png is very good and compact,
loss-free.

Convert your eps's to pdfs using epstopdf. The resulting pdf images are
also very compact. If you're unlucky, some of your eps's will fail to
convert. Run them through eps2eps to clean them up (which also crops the
bounding box to remove white space - though some applications put an a4
white box as a background which requires more work). Then epstopdf the
result. I believe \usepackage{epstopdf} will do this on the fly for you,
but I'd be inclined to do the conversion once manually and be done with
it.

By the way, if you want to retain flexibility to use either latex or
pdflatex, keep both sets of graphics files around, e.g., graph.eps and
graph.pdf, image.bmp and image.png, etc. and include them without any
suffix, e.g.

\includegraphics{graph}

LaTex will look for eps, bmp, ... in some order (which you can specify),
pdflatex will look for pdf, png, ... in some order...

so the appropriate graphic will always be found. There's more you can do
to specify graphics extensions and define commands for how they should
be handled. See the graphicx documentation and scratch your head.

Hope this helps.

Steve

I have inserted a graph with several different curves that are each a different color.  In the caption I would like to use colors to make things more clear to the reader.

The only important, or rather vital, rule for ALL floats (figures and
tables) is to place the \label command AFTER the \caption command (as this
is what trips the counter).  Inside the \caption argument is also fine.

So, check that ALL of your floats are set out this way.

This is perfectly normal. You have to burn the image (the iso-file) to a  
cd and then you have yourself an installation cd with TeXLive. See  
<http://tug.org/texlive/> for more details.

I'm typesetting a document using report.cls,

latest footmisc on ctan (the one on the latex companion disc, if not
also the latest tex live) plays with the setspace package.

from the documentation:

% \item[\normalfont\textsf{setspace}] The \textsf{setspace} package
%   modifies the line spacing is calculated in footnotes.
%   \textsf{Footmisc} knows about this, and preserves the change.
%   However, you \emph{must} load \textsf{setspace} \emph{before}
%   \textsf{footmisc}.

the faq answer shows you, but it could do with an example.  something
like:

\begin{enumerate}
\item blah 1
\suspend[blah]{enumerate}
here we are again
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item nest 1
  \suspend[nest]{enumerate}
  happy as can be
  \resume[nest]{enumerate}
  \item nest 2
  \end{enumerate}
\resume[blah]{enumerate}
\item blah 2
\end{enumerate}

this isn't entirely satisfactory, in fact.  as far as latex is
concerned, the "nested" list is a top-level one, so there's no
distinction about labels.

i can imagine circumstances where the facility might be useful,
though...

i'll try and get an example into the faq in some future revision.

Folks,

I have a moderately complex graphic available as .jpeg or .bmap that I
want to incorporate into a Latex document.

I can use GIMP to save it as .ps. However Ghostscript tells me that it
can't be converted to  .eps and if I try to import it using
\includegraphics
I only get an empty space.

Any suggestions on how to handle this?

Many thanks,

I think your best option right now is to read

Try the convert routine imagemagick, it's wonderful for all kinds of
conversions:

http://imagemagick.org/

However if it calls the same ghostscript, you may need to find out why
ghostscript objects.

I suspect Peter Wilson wrote a manual with the idea of avoiding being
pestered for such problems: try page 105.

Cordialmente,  Philip G. Ratcliffe

P.S.  I have never ever used the memoir class, I just opened the manual (in
pdf version) and did a search for "table of contents".

i do have an email address for him, and i'm not giving it out.  he's
just retired, and is not at present responding to mail.  he's a decent
bloke, but an answer three months hence isn't going to help you, and
is going to add to the clutter when he restarts.

stranger things have been known to happen.

the other thing that might just conceivably be consulted is the tex
faq.

You don't mean people actually write them just for ... fun?

Ah, sorry to have missed out the standard reference (don't tell me: you only
wrote the TeX FAQ to beat everyone in the citations index).

Hello again

Using TeXlive and Winedt on a Windows machine....

When I try to typeset

PREAMBLE OMITTED

    model1\=\hspace{3in}\=\kill
    model1\= $\leftarrow$ lm(weight$\sim$height)\\

    abline(v=mean(height))\\
                        \>\>\# Vertical line at mean of height\\
\end{tabbing}

using the pdflatex button, I get an error that 'something is missing,
perhaps a missing \item'

When I try to typeset just this bit with 'compile selected block', 
everything after the second line is overprinted onto the same line.



I have a feeling I'm missing something simple, but I've been looking at
this for 30 minutes, and trying to find help in several books, to no
avail....

Any help is, as always, appreciated

Thank you very much, Steve! That worked just fine and helped *a lot*!
But somethings regarding pstricks did not. Is there some way to enjoy
both the resources of pdflatex *and* pstricks?

Thanks again.

This one works with me (I've chanched a couple of  typing errors?), but 
perhaps you meant something a little different.

Hi Peter Flom

I have modified your document, I hope that it be useful:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{tabbing}

Dear Sir,

I am along time user of TEX, this is my way of life, cause I am a physicist
and I write papers.
I am not a computer expert, on the contrary, I place myself at stage of
infancy.

My hard drive crashed, and I need TEX back. I purchased it from you, and I
just can't figure out how to use it. It's a pain to understand all those
tens and tens of little programs I stil have to download, and still doesn't
work.

Finaly, I can edit in that new editor, but I don't know how to create a
dvips comand, and how to see my ps file.  It's very depressing, believe me.
I create a ".tex file and it looks okay, and I transfer it to my old
computer, which has an older version of TEX. Nomatter what I do, the
emerging ps file is the same, some instructions.

In addition, nobody who uses tex is here (summer) and I really have to
finish some files.

Please help me. If you just can provide me a simple list of TO DO with your
CD such I can re-install it again.

Please, in the name of GOD, help me and write me a simple list of operation,
and do not write it like for a computer expert!

Andy

Subject: [texhax] LaTeX tabbing oddities
Message-ID: <40E1F027.6000601@athabascau.ca>

Hello, I have been referred to your group after having no luck finding 
the asnwer to my question through various LaTeX FAQs and even the 
LaTeX3 project website and FAQ archive.

I am trying to print a section of XML text so that it will appear as an 
XML code snippet in the document that I am producing.  To create the 
appropriate style for this code layout, I am trying to use the tabbing 
environment to properly distribute the code segments.

\begin{tabbing}
\=\hspace{0.25in} \=\hspace{0.25in} \=\hspace{0.25in} \=\hspace{0.25in} 
\kill
\> <category>\\
\> \> <pattern>WHAT IS A *</pattern>\\
\> \> \> <template><srai>DEFINE <star index ="1"/></srai>\\
\> \> \> </template>\\
\> </category>\\
\\
\> <category>\\
\> \> <pattern>DO YOU KNOW WHAT A * IS</pattern>\\
\> \> \> <template><srai>DEFINE <star index ="1"/></srai></template>\\
\> </category>\\
\end{tabbing}

For obvious reasons, the tabbing environment will not allow me to print 
things like "\>", however when I pdflatex my file, it converts all "<" 
tags into upside-down ! and all of my ">" into upside down question 
marks.  I am not able to escape these characters to make them print 
properly, as a "\>" means move up to the next tab space.

Is there a way to properly display this bit of code in a tabbing 
environment, or should I just manually format each line with spaces?

Thank you so much for your help,


-angela

You don't actually need to be a computer expert to use TeX.

So how did you get it to work in the first place?

How long did you say you've been using TeX?

Now, why should you want to do that?

So you're not actually producing a new ps file, right?

Isn't it always just the same?

If you're that desperate, you're using windows and have a good internet
connection, why not download and install MiKTeX - you can have it up and
running in next-to-no-time.

Hmm.

Well, on page 105 you'll find:

  \maxtocdepth{<secname>}
  \settocdepth{<secname>}

While it admittedly doesn't explicitly say what to put as <secname>, a
little further down the page you'll find:

  "By default, the class sets \maxtocdepth{section}."

So you might guess at, say,

  \settocdepth{paragraph}  or  \settocdepth{subsection}

if you want the table of contents to include paragraphs or subsections.

Moreover, as suggested by Robin, you might try the LaTeX FAQ: number 192 of
the current version tells you that the tocdepth counter controls the depth
of inclusion (although it doesn't explicitly say what number correspnds to
what level - tut, tut, Robin).  So, \setcounter{tocdepth}{4}, for example,
will change the depth from the default (2).

Well, I haven't got a mathtimy.sty on my system and there doesn't seem to be
one on CTAN and so, although Google does return 7 results, I suspect it's a
typo!  Try "mathtime" instead.

there's a problem with changing tocdepth, since it takes effect at
toc-generation time, and the faq doesn't make _that_ clear either
(though it hints at it when it talks about the package tocvsec2).

so all-round change is in order.  so far i've tidied the markup of the
question (big deal).  will try and sort it out; whatever happens, it's
now at least on the list of things to do.

It sounds like it should be mathtime.sty instead of mathtimy.sty
