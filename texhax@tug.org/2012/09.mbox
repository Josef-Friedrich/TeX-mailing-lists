Hi tex group,


I am writing my essay using latex, and find a problem that things I defined using \newcommand shows different effect compared with writing it directly in the body text. Hope someone could explain why. Here is a small example.


\documentclass{article}
\newcommand{\sep}[1]{\vspace{#1}\noindent}
\begin{document}
Hello


\sep{4mm}
some things here


\vspace{4mm}\noindent
Are texts above truly indent?
\end{document}



By compiling it, we can see that the second line still somewhat indent although I give \noindent before. How could it happen? Thanks!

I'm not sure exactly what you want.
Maybe try something like this:

\documentclass{article}
\setlength{\parskip}{4mm}
\setlength{\parindent}{0mm}
\begin{document}

Hello

some things here

Are texts above truly indent?

\end{document}

It seems pretty clear to me that the OP ***did not*** want
to set indentation to be universally zero.  He wanted indentation
to be zero *after setting "\noindent"*, which seems perfectly
reasonable.  And he was *not* getting a zero indentation after
a "\noindent" if the "\noindent" was immediately preceded by
a "\vspace" and the two were wrapped up in a "\newcommand".

There seems to be an indentation --- or a space --- of about the
width of a single letter, at the being of the line following the "\sep"
command.  Such a space is unwanted and I have no explanation
as to why it appears.

There was some recent discussion about the intricacies of
"\vspace", of which I have unfortunately saved no trace.
There *might* be some insight available from that discussion.

A workaround for the OP's problem would be to define "\sep" by

     \newcommand{\sep}[1]{\mbox{}\\[#1]\noindent}

rather than in terms of "\vspace".  This seems to work, at least
in the OP's toy example.

Why things work with "\\[...]'' and not with "\vspace{...}" is
mysterious to me.  Perhaps some knowledgeable denizen of
the list will chip in and explain.  And/or suggest an alternative
(better) strategy.

     cheers,

It seems clear to me that the space after \sep{4mm} is being compiled 
while after \noindent it is swallowed as always.  Using \sep{4mm}% 
works, but here is a better solution:

\newcommand{\sep}[1]{\vspace{#1}\noindent\ignorespaces}

Spaces are "discarded" after command words.  Spaces are NOT discarded after braces.
In a paragraph, ends of lines are treated as spaces.

There is the command \ignorespaces that you can use in your definition.

I have been running TeXShop 2.3.7 on  MAC OS X version 10. 6.8.  I just downloaded and installed TeXShop 10.4.7.  As you would expect, nothing works.  I've looked at ABOUT TEXSHOP 2.47 and am unsure how to proceed. Obviously I've skipped several updates.  

Do I have to make all of the changes, e.g., for 2.38, then 2.39, etc.?

What other options do I have to get this going again with my old .tex files?

Thanks for your advice!

I wouldn't expect this at all. Did you upgrade anything else at all, or just TeXShop? I'm running 2.47 on 10.6.8 on my laptop, and everything works as advertised.

Not at all.

It would help if you indicated what exactly doesn't work.

(I'm also cc:ing this to the MacTeX list, which is more targeted to your issue.)

Hi TeX gurus,


I'd like to be able to save a box, and then change the color of the font 
in it when I come to use it.  Is this possible?

I suspect not (as the typesetting/macro expansion is already complete 
within the box), and saving multiple boxes and chosing the one with the 
color I want isn't practical in my particular application. I guess I'm 
asking if there is any sneaky tricks I can use to override the color in 
the saved box?

Here is a small working example that shows what I'm trying to do: Ideally, 
both lines of text should be the same color (red).

--------------------------------------------

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{xcolor}

\newsavebox{\boxFoo}

\begin{document}

\begin{lrbox}{\boxFoo}
This is test 1. 
\end{lrbox}

\color{red}

\usebox{\boxFoo}

This is test 2.
\end{document}

--------------------------------------------

What I see is that "This is test 1" is typeset in black, whereas "This is 
test 2" is typeset in red.


Best Regards,
Ivan.

LaTeX puts the current color inside the box, thus that the color
does not change if used in different color contexts. It is a feature
that the color of a box does not change.

Why can't you use a simple macro?

  \newcommand*{\macroFoo}{This is test1.}
  \color{red}
  ...
  \macroFoo
  ...

If you need boxes, this can be done using the low level TeX interface:

\setbox\boxFoo=\hbox{%
  \begingroup
    This is test 1.%
  \endgroup
}

The group with \begingroup and \endgroup is a protection for the case that
color commands are used inside the text. Color resetting is done outside
the current group and would slip out of the box without the additional
group.

Yours sincerely

Not really a solution, but you could always save the material in a token
list register rather than a box.  Alternatively you might want to
consider using XeTeX, in which the solution is trivial :

% !TeX Program=XeTeX

\setbox 0 = \hbox {abcd}
\special {color push cmyk 0 1 1 0}
\copy 0
\special {color pop}
\special {color push cmyk 1 0 1 0}
\copy 0
\special {color pop}
\special {color push cmyk 1 1 0 0}
\copy 0
\special {color pop}
\end

What I'm actually doing is fiddling with a bibtex .bst file and some 
custom fields to highlight certain entries in the bibliography.

So, rather than output the formatting code for the bibtex entry (@book 
usually) immediately, I was storing it in a box, and then applying some 
formatting to it based on the value of a custom field, and outputting it 
at the end.

It is difficult to use a macro as my formatting code is spread across a 
number of different formatting elements in the .bst file.

Thanks for this - I'm not very familiar with XeTeX, but this is an

Thanks!  However the pointer there to

MacTeX-2012-DVD.mpkg.zip (270 MB)
http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX-2012-DVD.mpkg.zip

is incredibly slow - 40 minutes to download!  I killed it.

Is there a better mirror than this?

I found a list of mirrors:

http://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/README.mirrors

and chose one, then dug down:

http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/systems/mac/mactex/

	MacTeX-2012-DVD.mpkg.zip	10-Jul-2012 20:03 	255M

Why is the size different than the page you mentioned?

wget http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX-2012-DVD.mpkg.zip

ETA 5 minutes.  That's better.

267859177 Jul 10 22:03 MacTeX-2012-DVD.mpkg.zip
Ok, that DOES round to "270".  The ctan.math.utah.edu archive is off.

Anyway, the installation went fine with the DVDbugfix.

SUMMARY:

Could someone please fix the tug page so that it points to appropriate
mirrors?

Thanks,

Tom

Mirrors are volunteers who give up a part of their bandwidth as a service to the TeX community, essentially enrolling in an ongoing cash contribution to people that they will never meet.  Some mirrors can spare less bandwidth than others, or share more during nighttime hours, etc.  (There is a monitoring system of mirrors to see that they are functional but it is imprudent to be aggressively demanding.)

Just as speculation, there are different definitions of `M'.  (It is also the case that mirrors update their holdings nightly so any change would reach some mirrors at different times than others; that sometimes accounts for a difference.)

The TUG page is right.  The URL starting with "mirror.ctan.org" goes to a program that sends people who want something to a mirror picked at random from their country.  Had you clicked it again then you likely would have gotten a different mirror. This shares the load among the people who have been good enough to volunteer for what is frankly not a glamorous project.

The l2tabu document

the focus is on how to create *text* in the shape of a spiral.  (See source below.)  They use the digits of Pi for text in a successful example.

I tried to insert a mathematical formula bookended by $s (say $a^2 + b^2 =c^2$) but the source does not deliver and stops with an (odd) error message.

Is there a remedy?  Is there a way to get mathematical formulas in the shape of a spiral?

The macros can be modified to support token groups instead of single tokens.
Then the equation can be split into token groups manually:

  \def\@tempa{#3}%

  \else
    \DoPerCharacter#1#3\@nil
  \fi
}

\def\PerCharacter#1#2{\DoPerCharacter#1#2{}\@nil}
% If the string ends in a group of tokens, then the curly braces

Table 1 of l2tabuen.pdf has a footnote "May be useful when defining
macros." This may apply to \centerline as well, and to other things 
in l2tabu. Indeed, in the definition of \chapter using \centerline, 
the macro programmer wants to avoid the extra vertical spacing 
that the `center' environment would introduce, rather the vertical 
spacing is done explicitly (using Plain TeX) in order to implement 
the designer's ideas straightforwardly. If you would use LaTeX 
commands here, their could be a danger that some package redefines 
the LaTeX user commands and alters the design. 

I tend to recommend deprecation of l2tabu, or even banning it. 
Don't tell adult people what to do and not to do!;)
It is bold and somewhat annoying.

l2tabu considers LaTeX users to have no idea of typography. 
This may be a partial excuse in favour of l2tabu. 
Or better, it should have some introduction with a general 
qualification "unless you know what are doing" -- at least.

l2tabu also deprecates \bf and the like, "arguing" that \bf 
does not use the NFSS. But bold italics and italic typewriter 
etc. rather are typographical sins, innocent LaTeX users 
are tempted to commit them by the NFSS, the serpent, they 
should be avoided by using \bf and friends; or you might use 
them "if you know what you are doing".

When a class like amsbook is maintained by (on behalf of) 
a journal, a publisher, or a scientific association, one should 
expect that "they know what are doing" (to be qualified ...)

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

I have heard of it being attributed to everyone from Douglas Bader
(1910 -- 1982) to Solon, lawmaker of Athens (638 BC ? 558 BC);
of the two extremes, I think Douglas Bader is the more likely,
but I cannot find any real evidence to support this.

Hello,
I'm Djamel Ghaffor, assistant teacher at the ENSET-University, Oran, Algeria. I'm beginner in Scientific Linux 6.2. and I'm asking in the best compiler for Latex on this system. I got Texmaker but I still have some problems with it.

Texmaker is not the compiler, it is the editor. What problems do you have?
Are they related with Texmaker or with LaTeX itself?

Personally I like TeXworks but many prefer Emac with AucTeX for writing TeX
code.

I guess that not, silence seems to modify LaTeX's warnings and error
messages, i.e., it works on the macro level. The font messages appear 
*after* the TeX run. Perhaps hours of studiying the TeX Live
documentation reveal a way to switching that logging off. Unable to 
spend them, I actually run dvilatex to see the relevant messages. 
When they are ok, I run pdflatex. As to hours: I also wonder that 
today the \tracingstats message doesn't appear anymore.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

I often have been confused by the term "TeX editor". 
Indeed one may think it is a "compiler" when it has 
a button for compiling. I think saying "TeX IDE" 
would often be more appropriate.

Cheer,

In response to my question about suppressing the list of embedded fonts at 
the end of a run of pdf(la)tex, you suggested
\usepackage{atveryend}
\AtVeryVeryEnd{\batchmode}

That certainly suppresses the listing of fonts.  Unfortunately, at the 
cost of also suppressing the useful messages I really want to see, such 
as:
(\end occurred inside a group at level 1)

### semi simple group (level 1) entered at line 1558 (\begingroup)
### bottom level

Is there a better choice than \batchmode?  Unfortunately, I don't 
understand the details at a sufficient level to work this out myself.

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{atveryend}
\makeatletter
\AtVeryVeryEnd{%

Hello \begingroup World

\end{document}

Many messages (also the messages at the end of the job) are not in control
of the TeX macro level. You can turn off all messages from screen using
\batchmode, but you cannot select them individually. Then you need a filter
program that filters the output of the compile run:
    pdflatex test | mytexmessagefilter
Or use an IDE that is able to show only the important stuff.

Hello Martin and Daniel,

The hack works only partially in my case. I get two new errors:

! LaTeX Error: Command \c at float@type already defined.
! LaTeX Error: Command \float at addtolists already defined.
 
Do you have any idea why?

thanks,

I've just installed a fresh debian stable and added texlive by using the texlive installer from CTAN.

When I try to complie a latex source file I get:

kpathsea: Running mktexmf ecrm1000
! I can't find file `ecrm1000'.

Please type another input file name

There are some posts online about ubuntu users who solved this by installing the latex pacakges 
???? texlive-latex-recommended, texlive-latex-extra, texlive-fonts-recommended )


but I don't want to have two duplicate latex installations on my machine.

Any suggestions?

TIA

might be an idea to know what you are compiling. An MWE would be nice

Are you sure that you don't for some reason actually have some of the 
debian texlive packages installed and thus you have compiled with the 
wrong one.

Thanks.

Everything worked fine yesterday. I've installed a package called "rubber" today, which is needed for the gedit latex plugin. Afterwards, the compliation failed (just a skeleton tex file).

I've now uninstalled "rubber" and now the complication succeeds. I've already checked earlier and no debian texlive packages have been installed (so I have only the ctan texlive installation).

It seems that "rubber" assumes texlive was installed with the debian packages (different directories).

Regards,
J

I tend to use latexmk instead of rubber, it comes with TUG TL.

have you tried installing rubber without the recommended packages? I 
don't think it depends on them directly.

Otherwise have you installed the texlive_local equivs? see 
http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html

I'll check latexmk later.

I have installed rubber without any of
debian TL packages. The only installation on the machine was the ctan
one, installed via the ctan installer.

I tend to use latexmk instead of rubber, it comes with TUG TL.

have you tried installing rubber without the recommended packages? I don't think it depends on them directly.

Otherwise have you installed the texlive_local equivs? see http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html

Works fine.

how are you compling latex from gedit? do you have a terminal window open for debuggin latex errors, and can latexmk run in that terminal?

Please remember the list

At times I know Ubuntu install extra 'recommended' packages without the 
user explicitly telling it to.

Might have been something like that. But I don't use plain debian, so I 
don't know.

latexmk is a commandline tool like rubber and like latex

I tend to use latexmk is a continous preview mode, i.e. it will 
automatically compile my document as soon as I save it. THen I don't 
have to press any extra keys or buttons.

If configured correctly, it will not stop at an error (requiring user 
intervention), just stop and wait for the next save.

Another aspect, also dealing with an off-list mail from Barbara Beeton.

Sometimes there seems to be confusion about the notion of "LaTeX". 

On the one hand, LaTeX is a restricted user interface, a front end 
for TeX; or just a markup language (that could be used to generate 
HTML or some other output format than DVI/PDF using some format 
converter rather than TeX). l2tabu could be (partially) justified 
by saying that it only addresses the use of LaTeX as a markup language. 

l2tabu therefore may be helpful for journal editors, especially 
as a reminder to use semantical markup only, rather than visual 
markup. \centerline especially is rather a low-level formatting 
instruction. For a journal editor, any non-semantical markup or 
just many commands beyond a limited set of markup contents tends 
to mean additonal work, e.g., removing those commands. The journal 
has its own ideas how to format an article. An obvious example 
would be \pagebreak. It is a "legal" LaTeX command, but is not 
semantical markup, it is visual formatting.

On the other hand, LaTeX is a collection of internal macros 
(definitions in latex.ltx) that package and class file writers 
typically use extensively, as a kind of program library. 
It includes almost all of Plain TeX (plain.tex), some macros 
are slightly redefined, \centerline among them. The result is 
the same: "\centerline{<content>}" sends 

    \hbox to\hsize{\hss<content>\hss}

to TeX's stomach (with some qualifications about <content>).

This is (I'm) sure what amsbook's programmer intended, also 
assuming that "CHAPTER 111" will not need a second line, 
so no paragraph settings as with \centering are needed.

If you say amsbook.cls should not use \centerline, then you 
also should say that amsbook.cls must not use any LaTeX 
internals, e.g., \@makechapterhead must not use \m at ne 
(which also is from plain.tex). This is a little ridiculous ...

However, indeed the LaTeX Companion contains admonitions 
of this kind. In the review of its second edition in TUGboat 
24:2, Claudio Beccari started one discussion as follows. 

    There is a third point I would like to comment on, 
    namely the excessively discouraging sentences
    connected with the use of primitive TEX commands.

I would be happy if somebody reads on there
(http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb24-2/tb77becc.pdf).

Cheers,

    Uwe.

I would like to comment on Uwe Lueck's comments on the use of plain and 
primitive tex commands in a latex document.  I once asked Leslie Lamport 
how he felt about that (this was at least 20 years ago) and his reply was, 
in effect, why not.

Yesterday, I had occasion to deal with a paper that had a number of 
\newcommand{s} of the form
\newcommand{\un}[1]{\underline{#1}}
which isn't wrong, but a simple
\let\un\underline
would do the same thing more efficiently.  One thing that really irritates 
me about amstex is that they have undefined some tex primitives.  One is 
\over (and its relatives).  The late Michael Downes once explained to me 
that this was because at the time it was being compiled tex didn't know 
whether to do in in display, text, or script mode.  So \over in an amstex 
document will lead to an error.  So how is frac implemented?  Well, I dug 
down once and my recollection is that first they \let something else be 
\over, then redefine \over to give an error message and then implement 
\frac using the something else!  At best all you can say is that some 
future implementation of some tex-like program might eliminate \over on 
the grounds of efficiency.  But maybe not.  They might be loathe to render 
millions of older papers obsolete.

About ten years ago I published a book that had several dozen matrices.  I 
used the plain \matrix{...} which works perfectly well.  I never thought 
that the AMS would publish it but that's who did.  I can imagine some poor 
copy editor changing all the \matrix{...} to 
\begin{matrix}...\end{matrix}.  Oh, I guess some script might do it 
automatically.

And don't get me started on how much more functional \def is than 
\newcommand.  I authored some diagram-drawing macros (a front end to 
xy-pic, actually) some years ago and they would have been impossible to do 
using \newcommand.  But when I use \def, someone is sure to comment that 
that is not latex.  No, it is not, but when did latex turn into a 
religion?

Which is not to say that latex doesn't provide lots of functionality that 
plain doesn't.  But it remains, like the underlying tex engine, just a 
tool.

Michael

It is not a religion, it is a cult.  A religion attract believers;

with an (automatically derived) html version
of the top matter and references for direct

the file back to square one, and delaying
delivery of the journal issue to the printer.

    Which is not to say that latex doesn't provide lots of functionality that
    plain doesn't.  But it remains, like the underlying tex engine, just a tool.

there are good reasons to request that authors

the authors to apply the tools in the cleanest

I would prefer the authors not to use \def, \newcommand or packages
outside the short list recommended and tested by the production
staff.  It would make my life much easier.  On the other hand as an
author of packages used in production I claim my right to use \def or
any other TeX construct:  I do this in contact with the technical
staff.

Well, I admit that I had confused amstex with amslatex.  I was talking of 
course of the latter.

I certainly agree that redefining \newcommand is shoddy and I would never 
do that.  But undefining a tex (not plaintex, but actual tex) primitive 
such as \over is inexcusable.  As for the use of \def, well if there were 
a procedure that had all the funcionality of \def and just gave a warning 
instead of stopping on error when you had redefined something, I would 
gladly use it.  I cannot imagine any other reason for deprecating \def 
than that you might inadvertently redefine something that you didn't 
realize.

You also confuse plain TeX with LaTeX.

It should be undefined, of course.  LaTeX provides \frac.  AFAIK
LaTeX3 will probably remove everything it doesn't support.  I don't
understand why people expect that LaTeX works as described in the
TeXbook.  LaTeX is something completely different.  Why is it so hard
to grok that?

Does \def give you such a warning?  Why don't you use \renewcommand in
order to redefine something?  Or add \nonstopmode to the top of your
file if you don't want it to stop on errors.

Yes.  \def is only preserved because LaTeX2e doesn't provide a
powerful argument parser.  But LaTeX3 does.

I still wonder whether you need \def for delimited parameters. 
If so, you may like redefine.tex,

    http://ctan.org/pkg/redefine

(light-weight) or the rather heavy ltxnew:

    http://ctan.org/pkg/ltxnew

Otherwise, what about LaTeX's \DeclareRobustCommand?

redefine.tex actually redefines \newcommand, indirectly, 
turns \@notdefinable into a warning. If this is a 
problem for some of the readers, I would suggest storing 
LaTeX's \@notdefinable and restoring it after loading 
redefine.tex optionally.

The documentation of redefine.tex is not very explicit. 
Just on reading its code I believe that it provides 
"warning only" commands \newdef, \newgdef, and \newlet.

Well LaTeX itself redefines the primitive \input, so LaTeX itself is
inexcusable ;-). 

Beside this amslatex doesn't "undefine" \over. The old meaning is
stored in \@@over and you can easily restore it if you want. 
And even if it would undefine it, you could easily save the meaning
yourself before loading the package. So what?

I couldn't agree more.  I suppose that, for some values of "undefine", 
amslatex doesn't undefine \over.  I mistakenly thought it did since I got 
the error: \over undefined control sequence.  Eventually, by tracking down 
the definition of \frac, I did find \@@over.  Yes, it never occurred to me 
to first let \let\OVER\over before loading the file and then 
\let\over\OVER after.  It is a useful suggestion actually.

If Latex3 really disallows things it doesn't like, I am afraid the tex 
community will fork and one branch (perhaps a very small branch) will not 
adopt it.  Is that what the implementers want.  I get intimations that 
they are seriously thinking of disallowing \def and \let.

As I just explained to Uwe Lueck, I cannot imagine doing my diagram macros 
(a front end to xypic) using \newcommand.  It has one macro, \cube, that 
has 20 required and 32 optional parameters that are delimited in various 
ways (look at it if you are interested).  I suppose you could use Keyval, 
but I wouldn't want to.  The reason for a total of 52 parameters is that a 
cube has has 8 vertices and 12 arrows.  There are four parameters each for 
the inner and outer squares, two for the placement and two for the hsize 
and vsize.  Each arrow requires three parameters, one for its shape and 
direction, one for the label placement and one for the actual label.

It is, I think, Ulrike, a clash of two different cultures and two
different sets of expectations.  There are people such as Michael
and myself, who would be perfectly happy for formats such as
<whatever, including empty>LaTeX to /add/ functionality to TeX,

<whatever>LaTeX provides a far more sophisticated alternative.

Now people such as Michael and I are probably members of a very small

Great! Little improvement: LaTeX's three most essential "commands" 
may be \documentclass, \begin, and \end. The last one redefines 
TeX's perhaps most essential primitive (unless you want to run 
TeX as a kind of demon).

Michael is making a very significant point here. and if the Latex3 
branch were actually to redefine or disable such primitives I suspect 
that Don Knuth's particular interest in archival stability might end up 
disappearing too.

The argument is accepted in this thread that LaTeX in its most extreme 
forms is "more sophisticated," but I am not sure that it is.  The LaTeX 
interest always corrects me when I suggest that LaTeX's penchant for 
making simple things difficult makes some things virtually impossible.  
Michael,  however, has given a good example of this failing.  I suppose, 
but am not absolutely sure, that most of the things I need could be done 
with \newcommands and a level of nested parameters that would make even 
a C++ programmer blench, but why should I bother.  I hardly use math 
mode at all, and I find, quite frankly, that a great deal of what I can 
identify as LaTeX formatting in journals that presumably impose fairly 
rigid limits on what a contributing author can get away with, is rather 
slovenly in some regards.  Scientific articles may require speed even 
more than the sort of things I do typesetting for, but there is pressure 
even in humanities publishing for on time delivery.  There is also a 
strong requirement that a design specification dating from many years 
earlier (lead type) be respected except in rare instances.  Some of the 
most desirable features I have not even yet managed to make function 
really correctly, but I am working on them.  Considering the trouble I 
have had with a simple invoice letter, which is one of the only places I 
actually use LaTeX, I am left to doubt whether I could ever hope to get 
such sophistications into shape in a syntax that hides from me almost 
all the values I need to track.

By all means advocate LaTeX in production environments where it is 
appropriate, but please be kind enough not to exile those of us who have 
different requirements for different kinds of ``beautiful books.

I suggest you study l3names.dtx - it would do exactly that when run in
format generating mode.

Very interesting letter from Pierre MacKay.  Of course, I agree with him, 
even if most of what I do does involve mathematics.  There are a couple 
points I would like to add.

The reason that I chose to harp on \over (and its relatives, 
\atop(withdelims)) is that it is tex primitive.  Here is what Knuth has to 
say on the subject:  "Control sequences names that are preceded by an 
asterisk (*) in this index are primitives of tex; i.e. they are built in. 
It may be dangerous to redefine them."  Indeed.  If a control sequence is 
made underfined, you can just copy the definition, but if a primitive is, 
you are stuck.  I consider that unpardonable.  Okay, it wasn't truly 
undefined, but it took work to find it again.

The reason that the journal I do the tex editing for (which uses 
exclusively latex 2e) looks a bit careless as mentioned below is that I 
just get tired of fighting with authors.  Also we have made a decision to 
allow small extrusions into the margins.  Yes, I know that these would 
probably not be allowed in the old days, but it just doesn't seem worth 
the effort.  If the authors only learned to use our public cls file, they 
could fix those themselves, but all too often they don't.  And there has 
been at least one paper that I felt strongly about publishing (much more 
strongly than the author, oddly enough) that couldn't be published if I 
insisted on following our format.

It's worse than you thought --- and better.

On one hand, in the Expl3 programming modes you would use
\cs_set_nopar:Npn instead of \def. (Read: namespace 'cs'; function
'set_nopar'; signature 'takes arguments token, parameter code,
token-list'.) And when LaTeX3 is built as a format, the name `\def`
will be un-defined.

On the other hand, \cs_set_nopar:Npn *is* the primitive \def, just as
\cs_set_eq:NN is a very thin wrapper around \let; the new names are
for consistency with the rest of the environment.

On the gripping hand, all TeX primitives will remain available and
identifiable as primitives: \tex_def:D and \tex_let:D, for example.
(Read: namespace 'tex' for Knuth TeX primitives; function 'def' or
'let' or whatever; signature 'Don't use unless you know what you're
doing'.)

So yes, it will be difficult to write code that will work under Plain
TeX and LaTeX3, but you'll have complete and unambiguous access to the
primitives, so it shouldn't be too had to write a minitex environment
that restores the old names.

Oh, wow. I suspect that the argument processor feature of LaTeX3's
xparse *might* be able to handle that [but I don't know enough to
suggest how]. But the primitives are all still there when you need
them, just with different names.

Well, going on a suggestion from someone, I can precede the loading with 
\let\LET\let and \let\DEF\def and follow it with \LET\let\LET and 
\let\def\DEF.  But isn't that all kind of silly?

Or use the \cs_set family of functions -- which are the same things,
renamed -- while taking advantage of the more readable boolean
expressions in Expl3.

Or don't, and LaTeX3 users will have to wrap `\input diagxy` with some
pre-packaged solution that restores the Plain csnames.

(Also, the Plain csnames are only undefined when LaTeX3 is built as a
format; when it's being used as the expl3 package it leaves those
names intact.)

one begins to wonder whether it will be
possible to upgrade a production system
to latex3 without both the technical and
production staffs suffering unnecessary
nervous breakdowns.  such systems have
multiple person-years of effort invested
in producing a reliable product, allowing
reasonable flexibility for authors (even
if they don't think so) and requiring
minimal recoding by production staff, who
should in any case be concentrating on
the content, not the coding.

without backward compatibility, it seems
that we might be doomed.  (of course,
some production shops will probably just
take the opportunity to send the material
offshore for rekeying, putting us back
where we were with hot metal composition,
galleys, and all that, without, i should
note, the presence of competent editors,
who have long since been put out to
pasture.)

i'm not against progress, but feel that
"progress" implies improvement without
completely derailing the system in the
process, or at least, requires no
additional effort than the old way
after the learning curve is past while
yielding results that are not degraded.
kindly remember that degraded results
are the reason that tex exists in the
first place.

gloomily,

No.  Their aim is a _consistent_ programming interface for macro
writers which doesn't borrow constucts from other languages.

I assume that LaTeX2e will still be present in the future because
LaTeX3 will not be fully downward compatible.  The reason is that
LaTeX2e already inherited a few design flaws from LaTeX2.09 which 
are currently fixed by extra packages. 

 > I get intimations that they are seriously thinking of disallowing

They will certainly pertain the _functuality_ of \def and its
variants.  Please run

  texdoc expl3

and read section 3.2.5 (Functions: argument specifications).

Simply removing \def without providing a replacement isn't possible
anyway.

I don't know whether they intend to touch \let at all.  ATM I can't
imagine any good reason.

Well, I think \newcommand is a user level command and not sufficient
for package or class writers.  It's quite useful to extend the logical
markup at user level, for instance

  \newcommand{\filename}[1]{\textsf{#1}}

Regarding \cube, you could also run

  texdoc xparse

At a first glance it seems that it doesn't support arbitrary
delimiters.  Maybe it's useful in combination with \def though and
could make your code more concise.  Writing a parser with \def which
has to handle optional arguments is not overly difficult.  But it's
always a lot of manual work.  When I played with xparse about twelve
years ago I was quite amazed how much time it saved me.


Let me summarize: The subject of this thread is \centerline, not \def.
l2tabu is correct, the problem is that amslatex doesn't follow LaTeX
conventions for internal macros (\centerline instead of \@centerline).

Both, \centerline and \over are not supported by LaTeX.  For example,
boxes in LaTeX support color, plain TeX boxes don't (consult the LaTeX
kernel code).  Even if non-LaTeX control sequences seem to work, you
might be surprised later.  Therefore they are deprecated.

\def is very dangerous because it silently overwrites existing macros.
This is fine if you're using plain TeX because you have the TeXbook at
hand and know which macros you wrote yourself.  But LaTeX is modular.
Just include another package and nothing is as it had been before.
And you don't even get a comprehensible error message.  \newcommand at
least tries to report the error where it occurs.  Sure, \def is
unavoidable if you need a powerful argument parser.  It should only be
used by people who exactly know what they are doing, and not because
\def is more convenient to type than \newcommand.

It's a matter of fact that LaTeX2e has several deficiencies.  It
inherited some design flaws from 2.09 for the sake of backward
compatibility, didn't remove obsolete (unsupported) control sequences,
and didn't replace all critical control sequences by its own.  But
LaTeX2e never claimed to be perfect.  Its purpose was to fix the most
significant flaws in 2.09.  The developers always concentrated on
LaTeX3.  This will be the "real thing".  I'm looking forward!

Regards,
  Reinhard

No the problem is not "if I care one ioto or not", or some "pure
TeX" against "LaTeX"-thing  but that I let other people (package &
format writer) the right to make decisions and use all possibilities
of TeX.

One "functionality" of TeX is that you _can_ redefine primitives.
This functionality is built-in. And the TeXbook make say that it is
*dangerous* to redefine primitives, but it doesn't *forbid* it. 

Michael wants the right to use \def and \matrix even if LaTeX or
amslatex discourages the use of this commands, but on the other side
he denies the right of the amslatex and latex3 writers  to do what
they think is senseful - as far as can see on the only ground that
it makes life for himself a bit more difficult. 

Sorry but in my long years of using LaTeX it has happened quite
often that some change in a package or in the format - as in the
case of the switch from latex2.9 to latex2e -  forced me to adapt
some documents. And then I grumble a bit and go on, sometimes I
tried to convice a package writer that the change was to the worse
but I didn't call such changes "inexcusable": If I couldn't convince
the responsable I write my way around the problem.

Subject: [texhax] TOC "Appendices" entry comes after 1st appendix entry when
 \include used
Message-ID: <889FC693-615C-4A4F-9167-214ECD887873@gmail.com>

I use the appendix package with its toc option for a book document. If the first of several appendices is inserted by using \include, then the "Appendices" heading in the TOC incorrectly appears after the entries for the first appendix.

This happens no matter whether I use the \appendices command, as shown below, or else the appendices environment.
The same thing happens if I don't use the appendix package but instead just the \appendix command and use an\addcontentsline to insert the "Appendices" item in the TOC.

This behavior does not occur if the body of the appendix is inserted directly in the main document.

The behavior does not occur, either, if I use \input instead of \include. However, I really need to use \include.

Here's a minimal failing example. (The 2nd appendix is here just to highlight the effect in TOC. In the main file, I have a 2nd appendix right there, but it makes no difference if I put that in a separate file and use another \include for it.)

  %%%%% main file %%%%
\documentclass{book}
\usepackage[toc]{appendix}

\begin{document}

\frontmatter
\tableofcontents

\mainmatter

\chapter{First things}
This comes first.

\appendices

\include{appendixA}

\chapter{Another addendum}
This is some more information.

\end{document}

  %%%% file appendixA follows? %%%%

I find your analogy and your argument uncompelling, to say nothing of
petulant.  If a LaTeX package writer updates a package and something
changes, one might presume that he/she did so because he/she was
fixing a bug or improving the capability of the package.  And thus the
change is not only excusable but maybe even a Good Thing.

On the other hand, redefining \over or \def strikes me as gratuitously
authoritarian.  The argument that someone might use \def to clobber
some part of a LaTeX package is weak; a "pure" LaTeX user won't know
about \def, and someone who knows enough (plain) TeX to know about
\def probably realizes the danger of doing so, and can make a grown-up
decision whether the risk of using \def is worth the gain.  (Yes,
there is probably some small percentage of people who have learned
about \def and haven't figured out that using it willy-nilly is
dangerous, but that is all part of the learning experience.)

Cheers.

Unfortunately, better: LaTeX's 4 most essential macros may be
\documentclass, \begin, \document, \end. The last one replaces 
TeX's most essential primitive ... (the latter survives as \@@end,
called by LaTeX's \stop)

That's not an argument. A package is always authoritarian. It always
empress on you usage rules like syntax and command names. The
question is if the redefinition of a primitive like \over restricts
your possibilities in an unsupportable way. 

LaTeX redefines the primitive \input. I have never see anyone
complain about it, but if one doesn't like it it is an one-liner to
restore the original meaning (at your own risk).

LaTeX redefines the primitive \end. Again I have never see anyone
complain about it, but again the old meaning is not lost and can
easily be restored (at your own risk).

amslates redefines the primitive \over. Before this discussion I
have never seen someone complain about it, and again the old meaning
is not lost and can easily be restored. 

I never saw a package redefine \def, only some user which didn't
realize what they were doing and were quite bewildered about the
resulting errors. I personally think it is a very good idea of
LaTeX3 to use internally other names and so to free all this short
names like \def, \hbox etc for user commands. And again: The old
meaning will not lost and you will be able to remap it to \def. 

So my reaction to the complain about "\over" is "so what"?

Were you ever affected personally from one of this redefinitions?
Did you - before you read this discussion - actually ever cared?

Such a definitive statement.  And reminiscent of a Monty Python skit.

That's one question, but not the only one.
Here's another one: does the package impose gratuitous restrictions on
you, introduce gratuitous changes to the meaning of TeX primitives,
or just set down the manner in which you use the capabilities of the
package?

So perhaps these two redefinitions don't bother anyone, OR perhaps
you've just never seen them complain.

But why does the original meaning of \over have to be separated from
the token "\over"?  Is there some reason why that is truly required,
or did the amslatex authors decide "we don't like \over, and so we
will make it difficult for people to use it"?  Perhaps you know the
definitive, authoritative answer to that, I certainly don't.

Apparently you don't care about the trouble this causes some people.
But I don't see that your lack of concern makes it OK in any global
sense.

> Were you ever affected personally from one of this redefinitions?
> Did you - before you read this discussion - actually ever cared?
To answer your question, which is arguably irrelevant to the
discussion... A long time ago, when I started to use TeX, I looked at
LaTeX and decided I didn't like its "my way or the highway" attitude.
Specifically, I wanted to change a couple of its formatting decisions
and after looking at *the* worst spaghetti code I've ever seen trying
to figure out what to change, I decided I didn't want to use LaTeX at
all.  (I assume newer versions of LaTeX are better written, but I
haven't checked.)  So I stopped using it.  While I occasionally
provide what assistance I can to some local LaTeX beginners, I have
made a point of avoiding LaTeX whenever possible, so its bad design
decisions (as well as its good ones) mostly go unnoticed.  However, in
the course of providing assistance where I can, I sometimes have to
figure the "LaTeX way" of doing something because the plain TeX way
doesn't work, for some good or bad reason.

Cheers

Just on this for you, Jim. In the meantime, a number of LaTeX packages 
have appeared that provide interfaces for different designs. There 
are packages for choosing your own design, but also some people say 
that just using koma-script instead of LaTeX's standard classes suffices
to get pleasent design. So I would say that today, the design provided
by LaTeX's standard classes no longer is a reason not to use LaTeX.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Exactly. I don't care when people make a lot of fuss about a very
small nuisance. The amslatex team certainly did not change \over out
of a whim. The reasons are explain in the technotes:
ftp://ftp.ams.org/ams/amslatex/math/technote.pdf

As until now neither you nor Michael have offered any concrete
evidence that the redefinition is "inexcusable" and so more than a
small nuisance I weight in this conflict of interests the arguments
of the amslatex team higher than the trouble for the small number of
LaTeX users which insist to use \over. To quote Barbara (from
another context):

Subject: [texhax] spurious space with abbrevs.sty
Message-ID: <1348748764.82321.YahooMailNeo@web120806.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Using the abbrevs.sty package for abbrevations, I've defined
\newabbrev{\pc}{personal computer (PC)}[PC]

which expands first to "personal computer (PC)" and afterwards to "PC".

doing something like "{\PC}s" produced "PCs" in my previous texlive installation, but now I've made a fresh installation and I'm getting "PC s", so there's a spurious space.

Any ideas how to fix this?

The abbrevs package on the recent TL installation is from 2001. 


TIA

With the greatest respect, the reasons are /not/ explained : rather,
Michael shews how the presence of \over massively complicates TeX's
mathematical internals [1] (something that no knowledgeable TeX user
would deny).  But removing the user-level interface to \over makes
not one iota of difference; TeX /still/ has to jump through the hoop
in order to typeset mathematics, and no amount of tampering with the
user interface (and concealing useful TeX primitives) can change that.

Thus I would argue that the AMSLaTeX team were tackling the symptoms,
not the disease, and that their tampering (in this case) was both
unjustified and counter-productive.

I know I will end up regretting getting back into this discussion and I
apologize in advance to those who are bored with the whole thing and
feel it has gone on long enough.  I looked at the reference cited by Uwe
Lueck and found the following sentence:

"But in the case of \matrix,
\pmatrix, \cases this was a mistake?the plain.tex syntax for them is de-
cidedly non-LATEX in style, for example the fact that they use \cr instead 
of
\\ to mark line breaks, and they don?t use \begin and \end."

So the reason is that is decidedly non-latex in style and (my own take):
we cannot allow mixing of latex and non-latex.  No better reason is
given that supporting the authoritarian nature on latex.  I think I have
mentioned elsewhere that Leslie Lamport decidedly didn't have that
attitude.  The passage that really interested me was the following:

"Using the six generalized fraction commands \over, \overwithdelims, 
\atop,
\atopwithdelims, \above, \abovewithdelims is not really a good idea in
LATEX, for reasons explained below. I construe LATEX?s provision of \frac, 
and
the lack of any mention in the LATEX book of the primitive fraction 
commands,
as an implicit injunction against their use, although I don?t think 
Lamport actu-
ally spent a lot of time pondering the issue, and the basic LATEX version 
of \frac
provides access only to \over, not to \atop, \above, or the withdelims 
vari-
ants. The amsmath package, however, provides a \genfrac command that gives
user-level access to all six of the generalized fraction primitives in a 
way that
conforms to the syntactic conventions followed by all other LATEX 
commands.
Not only is the unusual syntax of the TEX primitives rather out of place 
in
LATEX, but furthermore that syntax seems to be responsible for one of the 
most
significant flaws in TEX?s mathematical typesetting capabilities: the fact 
that
the current mathstyle at any given point in a math formula cannot be 
deter-
mined until the end of the formula, because of the possibility that a 
following
generalized fraction command will change the mathstyle of the preceding 
mate-
rial."

Now the claim made is not objectively wrong.  Probably it would have
been better if Knuth had made \frac instead of \over.  But he made the
choice and if you dig deep enough, as I did, you discover that \frac is
based entirely on \over (actually on \@@over, which is \let equal to
\over).  So how does this escape the problems with \over?  I don't see
how it could.  Michael Downes once told me that \over would be omitted
in some future implementation of tex (an implementation that wouldn't
pass the trip test, I imagine, and therefore couldn't be called tex).
But I fail to see how allowing \over and \matrix actually causes
problems.

Downes goes on to discuss the problems this causes font selection and
made NFSS much harder to implement.  I agree that the NFSS is one of the
best features of the current latex and one of the main reasons I use it.
But I repeat, latex is a tool, not a religion.

I have been thinking during this discussion of what used to be my
favorite programming language, Forth.  Using it I programmed a primitive
tex interpreter.  It didn't do proportional spacing, hyphenation or
justification, but connected to an Epson FX-80 it produced recognizable
output (I also made a font builder).  But Forth development was in the
hands of a cult and, under their influence it has died.  They defined a
"standard Forth implementation" and anything that went beyond that was
"non-standard".  But Forth was missing several features: floating or
even fixed point arithmetic (only integer arithmetic was provided,
although you were free to program your own routines) and no string
handling although again you could make them if you liked.  Another
"feature" was that programs were supposed to be written as a sequence of
Forth "screens" using their editor rather than a good text editor.  And
a standard Forth program could not use input generated by anything but a
standard Forth program (e.g. the Forth screen editor).  And so Forth has
died.  (There is still a web site not updated in five years and I could
not find anything to suggest an implementation for modern PCs is
available.)

The comments by barbara beeton were especially disturbing since they
seemed to say clearly that the release of latex 3 would definitely cause
a fork.

My bottom line is that I can see no way whatever that restraining users
causes problems.

The technote explains why \over was a bad design decision by Knuth, but
I fail to see how disallowing users from using \over fixes any of the
mentioned issues, it doesn?t, and \frac is implemented using \over, so
it comes down to "we don't like \over, and so we will make it difficult
for people to use it".

Toward this end one will get better results by specifying

I have the impression that in this discussion different things are all
thrown together into the same pot called "LaTeX". amstex/amslatex (sorry
for not knowing or caring right now about the differences) is *not* meant
to be as flexible as possible. At least it did not start out as such. In
contrary: it was invented to archieve uniformity. Its decisions are based
on "how can we reduce work for the finnishing touches of our journal(s)".

With this starting point in mind, I think they are perfectly entitled to
decide they don't want to see \over used (even without any look at their
reasoning). I know their packages are widely used, for much more than just
the journals. I am grateful for those packages. Still, it's their right to
stick to their main goals, which *are* communicated freely.

To point fingers at LaTeX because of the decisions of the authors of one
package, however widely used, is like pointing fingers at all Westerners
because one Westerner made a movie you dislike.

Just my thoughts,

	Susan

Yes.  So as not to discard legacy usage, introduce,
as an optional substitute for \documentclass

   \documenttype[specific-rule-set]{whatever}

Each "whatever" would have a default "specific-rule-set".

In this mode the processor enforces the rules, and there
should be no user-perceived ambiguity about whether error
messages come from the LaTeX kernel or the underlying
engine.  In fact, the first round of parsing need not be
done under a TeX engine.

Yes, and it hasn't changed since them.  If it behaves different now,
maybe another package interferes with it.  Did you try a simple
document which only uses abbrevs.sty and nothing else?

Thanks for replying.


The spurious space happens even with no other pacakges loaded. Here's a minimal working example:

\documentclass[10pt]{article}
\usepackage{abbrevs}

\begin{document}

\newabbrev\pc{Personal computer (PC)}[PC]

{\pc}abc {\pc}abc

\end{document}


which gives "Personal computer (PC) abc PC abc",? so the spurious space is there.

The abbrevs documentation mentions the set of characters after which no space should be instered is \nospacelist.
It says it should include the left and right curly braces, but when I add "\nospacellist" to the above code I get
,.':;?-//!)]

so at least the curly braces are missing.

Any ideas?

TIA

there is a problem with the internal macro \maybe at space@
which _always_ inserts a space. However, the package abbrevs
loads some other packages which might have change their
behaviour.

thanks. 

the issue seems to be with the missing curly braces in "nospacelist" defined by abbrevs.

any ideas how to fix this?

Seems. If my understanding of the TeX engine is correct---it is not an
in-depth knowledge I have to admit---those braces will be resolved already
before this space is either added or not added. The TeX engine will have
gobbled them at that point already.

I hope someone else can help with that.

No, they are not /printed/. To see the contents of \nospacelist, 
insert \show\nospacelist and look at your screen, or insert 
\meaning\nospacelist. (Just on this, not a solution ...)

It loads 1. moredefs, 2. slemph, 3. relsize. 
1. and 2. haven't changed since 2001.

\t at st@ic from LaTeX kernel should set \@tempswafalse to 
avoid this. Maybe it has changed?

BTW, the earlier example works correctly on my notebook, 
no wrong spaces.

    Uwe.

I can't see how it could ever have worked: \maybe at space@ uses
\t at st@ic which sets \maybe at icfalse. Testing afterwards with
\if at tempswa doesn't make sense. 

\documentclass[10pt]{article}
\usepackage{abbrevs}

\makeatletter
\newcommand\t at st@space{} %new
\def \t at st@space {%
 \expandafter\let\expandafter
\reserved at b\expandafter=\reserved at a\relax
  \ifx\reserved at b\@let at token
    \@tempswafalse
    \@break at tfor
  \fi
}
\renewcommand\maybe at space@ {%
  \@tempswatrue 
  \expandafter   \@tfor
    \expandafter \reserved at a
    \expandafter :%
    \expandafter =%
                 \nospacelist
                 \do \t at st@space %new
  \if at tempswa 
    \space
  \fi
}

\makeatother

That's it, it works fine with my 2009 LaTeX (Debian TeX Live):

\def \t at st@ic {%
  \expandafter\let\expandafter\reserved at b\expandafter=\reserved at a\relax
  \ifx\reserved at b\@let at token
    \@tempswafalse
    \@break at tfor
  \fi
}

sets \@tempswafalse iff \@let at token is \ifx-equivalent to 
a member of the exception list (which is stored in 
\reserved at a). Previously, there was \@tempswatrue. 
Therefore \if at tempswa is \iftrue and allows a \space iff 
\@let at token is not equivalent to a member of the exception 
list. And as I said, it just works fine.

So they have replaced \@tempswafalse by \maybe at icfalse, 
and actually the 2009 latex.ltx doesn't have an \ifmaybe at ic.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Message-ID: <CAHbNS1=KAN6s8JEVNVfCWnV9WnfngVQqT5u2LyZAO_hHbpDhYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Tex community,

I am making notebook using latex, usually compile with pdflatex. I write
down everything I do in each day as a section. Right now, I think I should
add a topic for each section, or even part of a section, that I can compile
specific topic when I just need that topic. In a better way, as I can
imagine, I can re-order the pdf file based on the topics instead of the
original order.

Thanks for any suggest.
