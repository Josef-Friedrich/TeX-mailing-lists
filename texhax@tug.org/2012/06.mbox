Hi Pierre,
just a few remarks.  Scaling itself doesn't have any impact on the
quality of the included graphic.  It's included as is in the output
file and no downsampling takes place.  Modern digital cameras create
large pictures.  Since pdftex assumes 72 dpi by default, the necessary
scaling factor might be huge.  The quality doesn't depend solely on
the scaling factor.  What matters is the resolution of the image and
the resolution of the output device.  The latter is not known in
advance, especially because screen viewers often provide magnifying
glasses.  The best one can do is to provide photographs with a
significantly higher resolution than (presumably) needed and scale
them down accordingly.

The diversion via dvips is not necessary because TeX engines, which
support PDF output directly, offer two ways to scale included graphics.
I'm not confident with xetex, hence the following refers to
pdftex/luatex.

In Phil's example you can see that graphics can be scaled when they
are imported:

	\immediate \pdfximage width 2in {\filename}
	{\pdfrefximage \pdflastximage}

It's also possible to change the transformation matrix temporarily
when \pdfrefximage is executed.  This is necessary if you want to have
a graphic file included only once in your PDF file but want the
graphic to be displayed more than once at different sizes in the
document.  In this case the value of \pdflastximage has to be copied
to a macro immediately after loading the file for later use.

In order to scale each instance, you can use \pdfliteral the same way
you would use \special with dvips.  The PDF operator 'cm' is
aquivalent to 'concat' in PostScript, and 'q/Q' is equivalent to
'gsave/grestore'.

The ability to include a graphic once and use it several times leads
to smaller output files.  I doubt that this can be achieved by
manipulating external EPS files.  Furthermore, the latter requires
manual work or separate scripts or a makefile.  And things can become
arbitrarily complicated if the size of the graphic is supposed to be
relative to \hsize.

It's certainly easier to write a TeX macro for graphics inclusion,
even one which supports all engines.  All engines support \special or
something similar, and PostScript and PDF are quite similar too.
Phil's example is a good starting point.  Experience with PostScript
is very helpful in order to understand the concepts of PDF.

BTW, IMO the best tool which converts bitmap graphics to EPS and PDF
is sam2p.  It's extremely fast and creates much smaller files than any
other tool, without loss of quality.

TeX Live provides sam2p for Windows already.  On Unix, if it's not
part of the distribution, it can be downloaded from

  http://pts.szit.bme.hu/sam2p/

Sorry, but I can't resist to promote sam2p.  It's a pity that most TeX
users aren't aware of it.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Reinhard,

It's also worth noting that with pdftex one can add graphics 
using /pdfannot. For instance, the attached gigapan.pdf 
shows the flight-deck of the space shuttle, Discovery,
with an impressive level of detail. Of course, the downside
is that such PDFs require Adobe Reader 9.x, or greater
(9.3.4 on Linux) and so are not strictly portable. 
Nevertheless the approach has its place.

Message-ID: <tencent_03F85D49437952936CF64A19@qq.com>

Hi texhax group,


I have a question about how to customize bibliography appearance using bibtex. Normally, the standard styles convert a single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in TeX to denote number ranges (as in 7--33). If I want to maintain the single dash in my bibliography, which option should I set to achieve this?


Thanks,

given that this is bibtex, there are no options.

But have you tried

pages ={{1-20}}

(untested)

one can usually hide stuff inside {}'s

I have old entries that contain only one dash and I just checked -
they typeset just like with two dashes.  So you can just do it,
nothing special needed.  It's not clear to me why there is this
convention of double dashes ... maybe someone knows?

Given that the dashes look the same after being typeset, why should
you want to have single dashes in the database?

Not being an expert on these things, I created a PDF with an entry
from a double dash in the bib database.  This comes out as a single
dash when cutting and pasting.  It's a unicode double byte character. 
It does NOT look like two dashes in Skim on Mac OS X.  I get 3 unicode
bytes cutting from an Acrobat display.  In acrobat it looks and
handles like one character.

So I can't replicate your effect.

Hi Tom,


Thank you for your hint. I set up a wee example, it generate a single dash when I write one dash in the database. But when I compile my working file, it will generate two dashes no matter how many dashes I give to pages in .bib database. Obviously, I have to debug it myself. Thanks for your help.

the question isn't how to get an en-dash.
(en-dashes are used to indicate spans, for
example of pages, 23--25, or years, 1954--63.)
ruan wants a simple hyphen, which might be
used to indicate a page within a part, A-23,
instead of a span.  (i'm using a letter here
to make the distinction more obvious.)

bibtex apparently doesn't want to allow this.
there must be a way, using braces, perhaps
  pages = {7{-}23},
if not, then defining a command such as
  \def\nbhyph{-\nobreak}
and having this resolved at the latex level
rather than by bibtex, is probably the best
that can be suggested.

The difference in byte-lengths for U+2012 Figure Dash (or U+2013 En 
Dash---the two are distinguished by function rather than appearance) is 
caused by the fact that Mac stubbornly insists on continuing to use 
16-bit UTF-16, while most of the rest of the world has adopted the more 
general UTF-8 which works on just about anything and has some one-byte 
lengths, some two and a great deal of three, after which it is entirely 
capable of moving on to four.  I prefer to use Figure dash for instances 
like 2--3 (this mailer will not code for either figure dash or en dash), 
showing a range, but it is unfortunately not widely in fashion.  All Mac 
characters until you get into the stratospheric limits of Unicode fit in 
a 16-bit length, but that also means that all ASCII characters have a 
00000000 byte starting them, which doubles the length of an ordinary 
non-accented Latin text.  UTF-8 allows one to avoid the sometimes 
problematic appearance of a 00000000 byte in text.  UTF-8 coding is 
darned near brilliant.

Hi,


I found the problem this morning. It seems the font I choose are to blame. A example of my condition is as follows:


\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{TeX Gyre Termes}
\begin{document}
I will cite this Muscle \cite{muscle}.
\bibliography{tex}
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\end{document}



I compile it using xelatex. It will always generate two dashes in the bibliography. Other font will ease my situation.

Hi,


It is a matter of font specification. What puzzled me is that almost all of the english serif font at my hand will generate two dashes. The default looks bad but one dash. I tried to set "pages = {7{-}23}" as you suggested, but that changed nothing. I am not sure where should I put "\def\nbhyph{-\nobreak}" in my .tex source file. Is it in the preamble? If that it so, I didn't see my desired output? Can you give me more hints? 


Thanks

    It does NOT look like two dashes in Skim on Mac OS X.  I get 3 unicode
    bytes cutting from an Acrobat display.  In acrobat it looks and
    handles like one character.

the question isn't how to get an en-dash.
(en-dashes are used to indicate spans, for
example of pages, 23--25, or years, 1954--63.)
ruan wants a simple hyphen, which might be
used to indicate a page within a part, A-23,
instead of a span.  (i'm using a letter here
to make the distinction more obvious.)

bibtex apparently doesn't want to allow this.
there must be a way, using braces, perhaps
  pages = {7{-}23},
if not, then defining a command such as
  \def\nbhyph{-\nobreak}
and having this resolved at the latex level
rather than by bibtex, is probably the best
that can be suggested.

Howdy,

You've got to tell fontspec that you want to use the TeX style ligatures (e.g., -- = en-dash) by

\setmainfont[Ligatures=TeX]{TeX Gyre Termes}

and the the translation will take place.

Good Luck,

I'm writing a mathematics book and have been asked to provide an index 
of notations. This would presumably have all the notations used in the 
book, with definitions, so it might be more like a glossary than an 
index, though of course if it's possible to include a reference to a 
page where the notation is defined that might be added value.

A quick browse on CTAN didn't reveal any packages specifically written 
for this purpose. Not wanting to reinvent the wheel, I thought I would 
ask if anyone has done this.

Not sure which function you are looking for. Just a remind latex itself has
function to make index if that is what you need.

See for example Robin Hartshorne's standard text "Algebraic
Geometry" (Springer).  The "Glossary of Notations" is a two
column left-aligned tabular-type thing.  In the left column
is a symbol -- the notation -- typeset as math.  In the
right column there is a short phrase description that
may or may not contain mathematical notation followed by a
comma, a long space, and a page number (first appearance).
The order of the rows in Hartshorne appears to be based on
the page number cited, but in other works there might be an
ordering of rows based on a somewhat ad hoc effort to
"alphabetize" the notations.

While such a glossary is back matter, it is not a standard
index.

I think you might find useful the glossaries package, by Dr. Nicola 
Talbot; she has prepared a very thorough documentation:

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/glossaries

If you have a recent TeX et al. distribution, chances are you already 
have the package and documentation; v.gr., in Linux TeXLive distro,

/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/doc/latex/glossaries

In there, there is also a very useful samples directory.

With the help of `miniltx' the LaTeX package `graphicx' can also
be used in plain TeX:

\input miniltx.tex
\def\Gindriver{xetex.def}
\input graphicx.sty
\resetatcatcode

\includegraphics{image.jpg}

\bye

The documentation for \includegraphics and `graphicx' can be
found in `grffile.pdf'.

As someone noted, graphics loads graphics.cfg that can determine
the driver in many cases (pdfTeX, XeTeX). Thus in case of XeTeX
the following will work most probably:

\input miniltx.tex
\input graphicx.sty

AIUI, XMLtex isn't a formal part of the LaTeX project --- it's ``just'' a package of macros.

Certainly the search:

http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=site:latex-project.org/+xml&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8

doesn't reveal much.

There shouldn't be a reason that xmltex wouldn't work w/ lualatex though (I have used it w/ xelatex) --- David Carlisle (the developer) has stated in the past that a lot of the complexity is in handling UTF-8, so a version for a modern TeX could be much simpler and arguably work better.

In the near term you'd likely be better served by using ConTeXt --- Hans Hagen has frequently presented on publishing w/ XML using ConTeXt.

I'd like to see a better XML publishing w/ LaTeX solution, simply 'cause I'm not getting any traction in learning ConTeXt and have a lot invested in learning LaTeX.

Typesetting from XML directly seems a lot more straight-forward on the surface than using an XSLT to convert to TeX which is the usual suggestion....

XSLT is most convenient for translating one XML document
type to another.  It is not so good for writing any form
of TeX.

For translation of XML to LaTeX -- which is quite viable --
or to Context, think rather in terms of what
(cross-platform) language you want to use for writing the
translator and then what library you want to use for
assistance in that.

xmltex uses TeX as the engine for translating to DVI (or
PDF), but I have felt somewhat shackled trying to use it.

Except for very high speed industrial work where something
like 'C' is required I prefer the "sgmlspl.pl" interface to
SGMLS.pm (Perl).  (I took up this route in 1998.  If
starting today, a Python framework might make more sense.)

One more point: Short of writing a translator from document
type X to LaTeX or Context, think about writing a translator
from document type X to document type Y, where translations
to either LaTeX or Context already exist for document type
Y.  (You will likely want to make small changes to Y or to
those translators.)  As long as validation of intermediate
XML stages is performed, chaining translations in this way
is reliable.  An example for Y is

A random guess: you tried to generate pdf output instead of postscript.

Subject: [texhax] Suppressing chapter numbers in sections,
	in book documentclass
Message-ID: <1339270718.4fd3a63e30334@webmail.mun.ca>

I am processing a book that has 100 sections, and no chapter or part.
I am using "book" documentclass (for various reasons). 
When processed in LaTeX, the section numbers (and in TOC also) are printed as
0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.100, using "0" as default chapter number. Is there any way to
suppress this default chapter number "0", and get only the section numbers as
1, 2, ... , 100, in both the section titles and the TOC?
Thanks in advance for any help.

Use \chapter? :-)

\renewcommand{\thesection}{\arabic{section}}
You'll have to do the same for subsection etc.

I suppose that Narayanaswami doesn't want that each chapter starts on
a new page and/or dislikes the way chapter titles are typeset.

Or use \documentclass{article} as a starting point.  Don't know the
"various reasons" for using "book".  Changing the visual appearence is
usually easier than changing the logical structure of a document.

The logical structure of a document whithout chapters and parts is
closer to "article" than to "book" or "report".

Furthermore, as far as I understand Leslie Lamport's ideas, the
documentclass "article" has no chapters in order to allow to create a
book or report from a set of articles.  This would mean that each
chapter of the book can be an article.

Can't I deduce from this that a book or report without chapter titles
actually *is* an article?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.1206110909250.20084@snort.ams.org>

i've just received this news from don knuth:

   A brand new printing of my book Digital Typography (1999) has just
   arrived on my desk, and I must say that I'm enormously happy to hold
   it in my hands, because hundreds of things that readers pointed out
   in the first printing have now been corrected. (The errata page at
         http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/dt.html
   lists more than 220 items, and dozens more things were tuned up
   that were too "fiddly" to mention there.)

amazon still lists only the 1998 edition,
likewise only the 1986 edition of the
Computers & Typesetting series (hardbound)
which have also recently been reissued in
newly corrected printings, so if you want
to make sure what you get is the updated
version, it's probably best to directly go
to the publisher, at least for now.

following up my earlier message announcing
the revised printing of don knuth's "digital
typography" volume, i've been in touch with
don's editor at csli (stanford's center for
the study of language and informatics).

he reports that csli and their distributor,
the university of chicago press, no longer
have any copies of the original printing,
and any copy of dt purchased from them should
be the new (2012) printing.  however,

       if the mistake of 1st and 2nd printing
       occurs, the purchaser of the DT book
       should contact us at pubs at csli.stanford.edu.

i can't speak for amazon or other distributors,
but purchases from the source should be "certain".

(check the listing at the tug "bookstore"
   http://tug.org/books/
at presemt there isn't any discount for tug
members for csli publications, but it's being
looked into.)

i will follow up with addison-wesley regarding
the updated (hardcover) printings of the five
volumes of "computers & typesetting", and report.

MacTeX, which is TeXLive for the Mac plus some Mac specific applications.

I would advise you to subscribe to the TeX on OS X mailing list

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex

and ask what would be better for you ---download and install MacTeX 2011 
or wait a few days (or hours!) to download MacTeX 2012.

I suspect that they're complaining of your having provided bitmap Type 3 fonts in your paper instead of Type 1.

There are utility programs which may be able to make the change in the .ps:

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/15092/replace-type-3-with-type-1-fonts-in-a-pdf

but better to update and fix the problem permanently....

You could switch to MacTeX:

http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/

and then after generating your paper and distilling to a .pdf check the font usage in Adobe Acrobat to see if your document preamble and font calls will need to be adjusted.

Subject: [texhax] rotating a glyph in pdfTeX?
Message-ID: <4FDA0D64.3090007@gmail.com>

I can't find an answer to this question, so it's time to visit the house of
the TeX gurus....

Is there a way in plain TeX (specifically, pdfTeX) to invert a single instance
of a particular glyph? I thought that pstricks might be able to do this, but
the complete pstricks-doc.pdf file doesn't seem to be readily available, at
least not anywhere I've looked.

To make the question crystal clear (I hope): I want to be able to typeset, in
pdfTeX, something like the sentence fragment "It was a Y", but with the "Y"
upside down (i.e., rotated through 180?). I recognize that some
micro-adjustment might be necessary to the vertical positioning of the box
containing the glyph.

I'm sure there are answers to this rather basic question somewhere on the
Internet, but I can't find them :-(

graphicx works also with plain tex:

\input miniltx
\input graphicx

abc\rotatebox{180}{Y}cde

Indeed; very cool.

And an interesting (but, I think, effective) style of documentation.

Message-ID: <3d70c37f.646.137ee56d26e.Coremail.songzhen2011@126.com>

Dear Sir/Madam,
 
Is it possible to load Arial fonts in plain TeX?
 
I use WinEdt as compiler and the TeX system is MikTeX 2.9. Whenever I try to use Arial bold fonts, for example, MikTeX will display the following messages:
 
---------------------
 
The arialb source file could not be found.
 
Running hbf2gf.exe...
 
hbf2gf <CJK ver. 4.8.0>
 
Couldn't find `aria.cfg'
 
mektex-maketfm: No creation rule for font arialb.
 
! Font \ab=arialb at 10 pt no loadable: Metric <TFM> file not found.
 
1.6 \font\ab=arialb at 10 pt
           \font\ar=arialr at 10 pt \font \abi=arialbi at 10 pt
 
?
 
---------------------
 
I am a novice user of TeX and have been using plain TeX. From several entries in the FAQ, I can see that there are ways to load Arial font family with LaTeX. However, nowhere can I seem to find any clue for TeX.
 
(By the way, some friends of mine who use PCTeX say that they do not have any problem using Arial fonts in plain TeX.)
 
Could you please kindly help, if it is not too time consuming?
I hope that it is in fact easy to explain it.  If it is too hard to explain to a beginner, please ignore my query. I understand that you work on volunteering basis and that it may be very difficult to explain these things to novices.
 
In any case, thanks a lot!

The following works on my system (with arial.ttf in the corking directory):


First, generate Arial.tfm:

ttf2tfm arial.ttf -q -T T1-WGL4.enc Arial.tfm

Create a test doc:

% test-arial.tex
\nopagenumbers
\pdfmapline{+Arial\space <arial.ttf\space <T1-WGL4.enc}
\font \arial = Arial

\arial
Testing Arial
\bye

Compile with:

pdftex test-arial.tex

The resulting pdf uses Arial:

Well, if you are willing to (liberally) interpret "plain TeX" as
"plain PdfTeX", why not go the whole hog and interpret
it as "plain XeTeX", whereupon neither you nor ?? will
have to faff around at all; it will just work out of the box !

	Lucida
Message-ID: <201206170140.q5H1eKfG027222@freefriends.org>

Dear TeX users,

Mid-June means there's just a month left before the TUG Annual
Meeting. If you're going to be in the Boston area (or just want an
excuse to go), please plan on joining us.  We've got a wonderful program
planned.

More news:
- Donald E. Knuth reports that a new, corrected reprint of Digital
  Typography is now available. He writes, "I must say that I'm
  enormously happy to hold it in my hands, because hundreds of things
  that readers pointed out in the first printing have now been
  corrected." The best way to ensure that you get the new, corrected
  printing is to order from the publisher:
   http://cslipublications.stanford.edu/site/1575860104.shtml


- As mentioned in the last newsletter, new corrected printings of
  Computers and Typesetting are also available. Knuth writes "...the
  books themselves are significantly better in hundreds of small ways.
  I went through every page very carefully and introduced many
  refinements, which have made me extremely happy with the result. I'm
  now able to replace my personal desk copies, in which hundreds of
  handwritten notes had been scrawled since the Millennium edition came
  out, by fresh versions that are essentially perfect (as far as I
  know).  This is especially true of Volume B, because important updates
  to the TeX software that were made in 2002 and 2007 have never before
  been available in print." See the section entitled Spiffy New
  Printings at http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/abcde.html.


- TUGboat 32:1 is now publically available on the web. As always,
  TUGboat needs your article/review/blurb/ musing for the next
  issue.  Articles on any aspect of TeX and friends are always welcomed.
   http://tug.org/TUGboat/


- TeX Live '12 is now frozen (svn revision 26895). Public release should
  occur in a few weeks, with the DVD to follow soon thereafter.
   http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html
   
 
- We are pleased to be able to offer the Lucida fonts in OpenType format.
  The Type 1 Lucida fonts are frozen and will not be developed further,
  while the OpenType fonts continue to be actively maintained and
  developed. For instance, the OpenType fonts support more languages,
  with a variety of visual improvements to their glyphs and
  spacing. Lucida OpenType is also one of the few font sets currently
  supporting OpenType mathematical typesetting, and (uniquely, to our
  knowledge) provides a bold math variant. The regular-weight Lucida
  OpenType math font includes a newly-designed script alphabet.
   http://www.tug.org/store/lucida/index.html


- As mentioned above, TUG 2012 will be held in Boston,
  Massachusetts, USA, from July 16 through July 18 at the Omni Parker
  House. The discount code for our group's hotel reservations and other
  information at the conference home page: http://tug.org/tug2012/

  August 23-26 - TeXperience 2012 (Beskydy, Czech Republic)

  October 8-12 - EuroTeX 2012 and the Sixth ConTeXt User Meeting

Hi,

Depends on what your base document class is and what additional support 
packages you are using (for example, memoir or koma-script).

I'm not sure if there is a really easy way of doing it (like a dedicated 
package or an option to a package or other), but you can do it relatively 
easily by some macro redefinitions.

If vanilla LaTeX classes like book, or report, you could try something 
like the following crude example - note you don't need to redefine 
\l at chapter for article.cls as it doesn't define it so we check if its 
defined first before trying to redefine it...


\documentclass{book} % or article, or report

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Begin redefinitions to remove page numbers from TOC
% 
\makeatletter

% remove page numbers from \part
\let\oldl at part=\l at part
\renewcommand*{\l at part}[2]
{
     \oldl at part{#1}{ }
}

% remove page numbers from \chapter for book.cls and report.cls
\@ifundefined{l at chapter}
{
   % undefined so nothing to do
}
{
   % \l at chapter only defined in book.cls and report.cls
   \let\oldl at chapter=\l at chapter
   \renewcommand*{\l at chapter}[2]
   {
       \oldl at chapter{#1}{ }
   }
}

% remove page numbers from \section for article.cls
\let\oldl at section=\l at section
\renewcommand*{\l at section}[2]
{
     \oldl at section{#1}{ }
}

% remove dots and page numbers for all document classes (*.cls)
\renewcommand{\@dottedtocline}[5]
{
     \ifnum #1>\c at tocdepth \else
     \vskip \z@ \@plus.2\p@
     {\leftskip #2\relax \rightskip \@tocrmarg \parfillskip -\rightskip
      \parindent #2\relax\@afterindenttrue
      \interlinepenalty\@M
      \leavevmode
      \@tempdima #3\relax
      \advance\leftskip \@tempdima \null\nobreak\hskip -\leftskip
      {#4}\nobreak
      % removed the dotting until the page number (#5) from here
      \par
     \fi}
}
\makeatother

%
% End redefinitions
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{document}

\tableofcontents

\chapter{Foobar} % Obviously remove if changing the doc class to article

\section{Foo}

\subsection{Foo}

\section{Foo}

\subsection{Foo}

\subsection{Foo}



\end{document}


Hope this helps,
Ivan.

in memoir it is relatively easy, one can switch off page numbers for 
each different entry type

Super!  I had guessed there would be a swishy way of doing so in Memoir, 
and there probably is for Koma-script also...

Hi,

I am trying to setup MetaType1 on my Mac system.   All the MT1 system setup
software evidently was created for Microsoft
environments.

Can anyone direct me to a setup scheme appropriate for the linux/unix/Mac

Thanks very much in advance.

I'm not sure there is anything out of the box.

Dear All,

 

Can anybody help me, that how can we convert from .fmt to .cls file?
Actually somebody has converted from cls to fmt by using etex. Now we
don't have source.

 

I will be grateful for any kind of help

Hi list, my questions is whether possible numbering the first table or
figure of a section or subsub...., because when compiling, the first
table appears as number one, ie Table 1, and not as for example 3.4.1
(where 3 is a section and 4 the subsection and 1 the number of table
or figure).
There are some form of change this?

Thanks all

Do you have the legal right to do this?

In the past, when I've been provided w/ just a .fmt it was because the person who developed the .cls file was unwilling to share their source (and vice-versa --- I'd have to contact a lawyer if someone tried to re-construct my macros from a database publishing job where they'd purchased only the typesetting functionality and not the source).

It's un-ethical to reverse engineer something which the developer provided w/ the expectation that it would remain as a ``black box'' unless something else has come into play.

Contact the original developer and work w/ them. If that's not possible, post an explanation here and we'll see what we can do.

While you are right, of course, there are special situations.

When I was much younger, one of my first assignments at a company that
should not be named to protect the guilty, was to reverse engineer our
own binary.  It was created some time ago and shipped to the customer.
After several years the customer asked to add some features - and then
the company discovered that the source code was on some old computers,
decommissioned and sold with the disks wiped out.

Since then I religiously use version control and automated backups for
everything I write.

Hi Walt, 
many years ago I installed MT1 on Linux.  AFAIR it worked almost
out-of-the box.  The only thing I had to do was to replace

  CONSOLE="CON"

by 

  CONSOLE="/dev/tty"

in the BEGIN section of the awk scripts.  All other files have the
same time stamp, hence I'm convinced that nothing else had to be
adapted.  The .bat files were only wrappers for other programs and
don't do anything serious.  They were not needed on Unix.

Don't know whether it's that simple with newer versions of MT1 too.
But it's always possible to compile a sample file and see where it
crashes.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I fear that it's impossible.  TeX evaluates (expands) macros before
dumping a format file.  With other words, if the source file contains
the expression

  3 + 4

, the format file contains only the number 7 and there is no way to
find out whether it was 3 + 4 or 5 + 2 in the source code. 

The purpose of a format file is to avoid that all calculations have to
be done at runtime.  Hence it only contains the results of such
calculations and macro expansions.

The only solution which comes to my mind is to consult the author of
the class file, as proposed by William already.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Isn't that something of an over-simplification, Reinhard ?
Leaving aside the highly dubious assertion that "if the source
file contains the expression 3 + 4, the format file contains
only the number 7" (3 + 4 is /highly/ unlikely to involve macro
expansion), consider something as simple as the following :

	\def \foo {\bar \baz}
	\dump

In the format file, the macro \foo will be defined but /not/
expanded.  If the user at run-time then interrogates \foo :

	\message {\meaning \foo}

he will be provided with the original definition, which may well
help him enormously with his task of re-creating the format source.

To demonstrate this, please try the following with VirTeX :

	\message {\meaning \centerline}
	\end

This will yield :

	macro:#1->\line {\hss #1\hss }

and that information has effectively been retrieved from the
format file.

Of course, a source file can even contain calculations, e.g.

  \setlength{\textwidth}{210mm}
  \addtolength{\textwidth}{-1in}
  \addtolength{\textwidth}{-2\oddsidemargin}

All you have after format generation is the result.
The information, how the result was calculated, is lost.

The following example contains three different definitions of \foo
with the same output of \meaning:

\def\fooshow{%
  \immediate\write16{[\meaning\foo]}%
}
\def\foo{\bar \baz }
\fooshow
\edef\foo{\string\bar\space\string\baz\space}
\fooshow
\edef\foo{\expandafter\noexpand\csname bar \string\baz\endcsname}
\fooshow
\csname @@end\endcsname\end

That means, the right catcodes has to be guessed and the
derived definition needs to be verified by comparing (\ifx)
with the definition in the format.

Also the format could have disabled \meaning to make
reverse engineering more difficult.

Yours sincerely

Dear List,

I want to install a new font (Adobe Garamond).
In the past, I succeeded with the installation. But, somehow, in recent 
LaTeX and postscript versions, things have changed significantly. The 
'old' installation guide doesn't work any more (I cannot find certain 
configuration files).

Has somebody a recent installation manual (step by step)?

Nothing had been changed for years.  I suppose that you simply missed
one step.  LaTeX is stable since 1994 and PostScript/Type1 even longer.
 
 > Has somebody a recent installation manual (step by step)?

Uncompress pad.zip from http://home.vr-web.de/was/fonts in TEXMFLOCAL.
You can expand this variables with

  kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFLOCAL

on the command line.

Delete $TEXMFLOCAL/dvips/config/pad* because otherwise updmap will
probably complain about font maps in this directory and abort.

Install your .pfb files in $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/type1/adobe/garamond and
rename them according to $TEXMFLOCAL/fonts/map/dvips/pad*.map .

Run 

  texhash
  updmap-sys --enable Map=pad.map

You should then be able to use the fonts, assumed that I didn't forgot
something myself.

If you don't succeed, try to provide more information.  We have to
know *what* doesn't work.  The least we need is the error message.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The Math IR Symposium is a traditional-style half-day workshop
with scientific contributions about mathematics information
retrieval. Topics include but not limited to:

- MIR systems design and descriptions
- requirements for mathematics information retrieval: 
  use cases and typical queries
- formula normalization, similarity, indexing
  and search algorithms
- mathematics retrieval corpora preparation and tagging
- semantically enhancing mathematical corpora 
  for IR (from math OCR or presentation MathML in DML)
- extracting semantic relations from corpora
- Evaluation of MIR (methods and test corpora)
Symposium contributions do not have to be complemented by 
MIR system registration for Happening.

 
Math IR Happening at MIR 2012 (July 8th, afternoon) 
=============================
http://cicm2012.cicm-conference.org/cicm.php?event=mir&menu=happening

A friendly competition for the systems presented at the workshop.
Since math information retrieval is still quite young and developing,
we will not make this an official competition, but a happening, 
where we get together and try our systems on a common set of 
problems. We expect the happening to transcend the workshop proper. 

MIR is part of CICM multiconference and is followed by Digital
Mathematics Library track of CICM on July 9th:

But also irrelevant : a format is a /fait accompli/, and
if the object is to be able to re-create the format from
source, and then to be able to change that source, then
in practice it does not matter whether the source code
with which the reverse engineer ends up is /identical/
to the original source, or merely has the same effect.

Agreed : identity at the \meaning level is not necessarily
suffient, but it is most certainly a good starting point.

Of course : the format could have done many devious things.
But is this likely, in the real world ?  All that Messers
Bodducherla and Rao are trying to achieve is to be able
to re-create a source file that will enable them to regenerate
an existing format, and then modify that source file to accomplish
new goals : let us not make their life more difficult by
suggesting artificial difficulties that almost certainly do not
obtain in practice.

But quite a lot installation guides are very old and still mention
files like pdftex.cfg, config.ps etc instead of updmap.

Subject: [texhax] When using more than 16 math alphabets,
	\mathtt uses italic font
Message-ID: <5eccf3ec-9da9-6865-887d-f5647f899e7e@me.com>

I know that in TeX, you can only use 16 math alphabets but XeTeX extends this so I was curious to enlarge the number of my math alphabets and I had to redefine some internals of LaTeX. My minimal working example is attached.

But this makes the word?"Test"?to apear in Italic. You can delete any of the?\DeclareSymbolFont?and then?\mathtt?worked as expected. This shows that this only happens when the number of math alphabets exceeds 16. Why does this happen and how should one fix this?

I tried the same thing with luatex and I got expected result so it seems that something is wrong with XeTeX.

XeTeX's \fam primitive does not seem to have been extended to accept
higher values, and since the legacy mathcode format does allow higher
families as well, the only way to access higher math families for now is
through extended math primitives. A simpler test:

\tracingonline=1
\font\cmscten=cmcsc10 at 10pt
\font\dunhten=cmdunh10 at 10pt
\textfont15=\cmscten
\textfont16=\dunhten
$$
\fam15 a
\fam16 A
\XeTeXmathchar"0 16 `A
\showlists
$$
\bye

Subject: [texhax] help with bug in NAR.cls
Message-ID: <20120625222631.GA11222@FR-W-C130981.local>

Dear TexHaxers:

The journal Nucleic Acids Research, one of the Oxford Journals,
accepts LaTeX files.  Recently Long-Sheng Kuo, a postdoc at National
Taiwan University wrote to me with a problem.  I have confirmed the
problem with the NAR.cls but I don't know enough of that kind of code
to figure it out, so I ask for your help.

Long-Sheng was working with the template linked to from this page:

http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/nar/for_authors/msprep_submission.html

namely

http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/nar/for_authors/nar-latex2010.zip

On downloading and unzipping this file one can run LaTeX:

latex NAR-sample
latex NAR-sample
dvips NAR-sample
ps2pdf NAR-sample.ps
open NAR-sample.pdf

Long-Sheng Kuo then substituted his name for 'Corresponding Author' in
NAR-sample.tex.  Surprisingly the 'L' of his name is gone, coming out
as 'ong-Sheng Kuo'.

I suggested putting a math space in front of his name: $\;$Long-Sheng
Kuo.  This works as a work-around and he can go ahead with submitting
his paper.  Removing the call to NAR.cls (and removing things it
defined) also fixes the problem, demonstrating that the bug is indeed
in NAR.cls.

It would be good to fix NAR.cls but I don't know enough of the
commands in there.  Could someone please take a look and (hopefully)
figure out how to fix this?

Thanks,

Tom

{L}ong-Sheng should work too (tried on my minimal example).

IMHO, it is best to report to package maintainers about that.

P.S. I'm not a TeX expert, there are more qualified persons on this ML
but seems that command: `\authorfont' causes the trouble. This its
definition in NAR.cls:

\def\authorfont{\reset at font\fontfamily{\sfdefault}\fontsize{12}{14}\fontseries{b}\selectfont\leftskip0pt\rightskip0pt
plus1fill}

because it is used like

{\authorfont\@author\par}

If I add `\relax' at end of command, right after `plus1fill' I get `L'
in output without tricks. But I'm not sure if it is the "right" way.

AFAIK, the l|L is gobbled by `plus1fill' (TeX looks for next letter sees
L and thinks it is for 'fill' instruction).

But there may be other solutions.

IMHO, it is far more than a starter tip : it is both an
identification of the underlying cause and a correct
solution.  If your correspondent does not want the
first "L" of his name elided with the trailing "l" of
"fil", the latter should be terminated with a \relax.

Perhaps it should be noted that this mistake (\fill sucking in a following l)
is a known error that has been documented previously, and it certainly should be
corrected by the maintainer of the package. The user should not have to
worry about this.

Hallo Reinhard,

thank you for your explanation.
I now succeed to install Adobe Garamond.
I think, it is the new(?) updmap that makes the difference.

want to use colors. That works fine as long as I don't nest the tabus, i.e.:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{tabu}
\usepackage[table]{xcolor}
\begin{document}
\taburowcolors 2{green!25 .. yellow!50}
\begin{tabu}{*2{X[c]}}
a & b \\
c & d \\
a & b \\
\end{tabu}
\end{document}

As soon as I try to nest these in the following way:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{tabu}
%\usepackage[table]{xcolor}
\begin{document}
%\taburowcolors 2{green!25 .. yellow!50}
\begin{tabu}{*2{X[c]}}
a & b \\
c & d \\
a & \begin{tabu}{l}
abc
\end{tabu} \\
\end{tabu}
\end{document}

I get an error telling me:

./test.tex:12: Missing number, treated as zero.
<to be read again>
                    \tabu at 1.H0
l.12 \end{tabu}

?

The error even occurs when I comment out the \taburowcolors. It's just 
loading xcolor with [table] and nesting tabus. Is this a bug or am I 
doing something totally wrong?

cheers
Arno

To get this to work right, I had to insert an \hfill before the \nobreak 
above:

         {#4}\hfill\nobreak

  Without that, the section headers were right justified.  Thanks again.

Subject: [texhax] About footnote of figures/tables
Message-ID: <CABbN1RxL1A2p0_qta803YzLDWJZOMuwqPDar5uAiuaT7W_=Wzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list, my questions is about footnote insert in figures and tables,
because sometimes above all in the final of pages, the footnote remain
cut. Is there any way for correct this? ie, which remain in one page
or make a page break

Thanks all!

Thanks Heiko!, i?m use this
\documentclass{article}

 \makeatletter
 \@addtoreset{table}{section}
 \renewcommand*{\thefigure}{\thesection.\arabic{figure}}
 \makeatother
for the figure in the sections and works perfectly, at the first
figure appears correctly
2.1 and not 1.

Subject: [texhax] Vertical alignment of cell contents in tables.
Message-ID: <4FECEF5A.6010602@auckland.ac.nz>


I am trying to make use of the p{} column specifiers and I would like
the cell contents to "sit" on the bottom of the cell rather than rising to
the top.

At first I thought I could do this by using "\vfill"  before the cell 
contents.
This works when the maximal number of lines in other cells is two, but
not when it is three or more.

A minimal example of trying this approach is as follows:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{4cm}|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|} \hline
\mbox{ } \vfill Melvin & This is a whole load of dingos' kidneys.
History repeats itself; it also mumbles. &
\mbox{ } \vfill Clyde & \mbox{ } \vfill Irving \\ \hline
\mbox{ } \vfill Fred & This is another great load of dingos' kidneys. &
\mbox{ } \vfill Fred & \mbox{ } \vfill Fred \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}

Note that the "Fred"s all sit on the bottom as desired, but "Melvin",
"Clyde" and "Irving" only go down one line.

Is there any way I can (conveniently?) get all contents to sit on the
bottom irrespective of the maximal number of lines in other cells?

Remember that one cannot use "\\" with the p{} column specifier.

Thanks for any advice.

     cheers,

         Rolf Turner

\usepackage{array}

But you can use \newline and \tabularnewline.

Many thanks to Martin Schroeder and Peter Zimmermann who pointed
out to me that using the package "array" and the column type b{width}
gives exactly the results that I want.
