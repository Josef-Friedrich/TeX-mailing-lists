It would be great if somebody with more insight then me could look at the following minimal example. It seems to me, that the small dash between the words is to far away from the "T". Could this be enhanced?

--------- minimal example --------

That's a property of the font, whether it include a kerning pair
for "-T". The pair "Te" is much more common.

TeX Gyre Pagella is an example that contains a kerning correction
for "-T":

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{tgpagella}
\begin{document}
  \emph{Expert-Teams}
\end{document}

Unhappily the Latin Modern fonts don't correct the kerning.
Then manual fixing of the kerning remains
(e.g., by applying the difference of "Te" vs. "\hbox{T}\hbox{e}"
to the left side of the "T").

Yours sincerely

Subject: [texhax] Footnotes in separate file
Message-ID: <CAGNO_-r=vAFwRhf2romms5P70_Uy=8bVm7V0KxtOfcp45RTqCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi. I have written another footnote and endnote LaTeX package for
personal use. My package allows me to typeset a footnote or endnote
without having to insert its text into the sentence where the mark is.

But it is not just the \footnotemark and \footnotetext approach.
For one thing, the notes can, but need not, be defined all of them in
a separate file, and in no particular order at that.

That might be useful if your document has too many notes cluttering up
the code, or as is often the case with philosophers and people from
the humanities in general, if some of them are so long as to make
reading the main body difficult.?

My question is: is this feature already provided by another package?
I could not find such thing at CTAN.

The package fits my needs as it is, but I will try to improve the
code, write the documentation, and make it available somewhere only if
that feature is not well known or trivial.

Thank you,
Eduardo

A macro \PrintKern that prints the value of the implicite kerning
between two characters:

\newcommand*{\PrintKern}[2]{%
  \begingroup
    \sbox0{#1#2}%
    \sbox2{#1\kern0pt\relax#2}%
    \dimen0=\wd0 %
    \advance\dimen0 by -\wd2 %
    \typeout{* SetKern{#1}{#2}: \the\dimen0}%
  \endgroup
}

% Usage example:
\PrintKern{T}{e}

Superscript citation is not default LaTeX. so check the documentation
of achemso.  Various packages provide different commands for this
use.  With cite.sty you would say Ref.~\citen{aaa}.

achemso uses natbib, as described in the documentation and demo
document. Use \citenum to get the unformatted number only.

I tried the
\makeatletter
\newcommand*{\citenst}[2][]{%
  \begingroup
  \let\NAT at mbox=\mbox
  \let\@cite\NAT at citenum
  \let\NAT at space\NAT at spacechar
  \let\NAT at super@kern\relax
  \renewcommand\NAT at open{[}%
  \renewcommand\NAT at close{]}%
  %\citet[#1]{#2}%
  \cite[#1]{#2}
  \endgroup
}
\makeatother

It works, but due to I use bibdistill to extract the .bib form
bib-datebase. it won't recognize the new command.

my question is that which package can be used to extract the bib out.

Thanks with best regards,

The short answer to your question is that this is pretty well described
in the beamer user guide. Here is a working example:

\documentclass{beamer}
\usetheme{Madrid}
\setbeamertemplate{bibliography item}[text] %default is an icon of an
article

\begin{document}

\frame{\frametitle{Hello}
According to \cite{ref1} hello is a good word.

\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
\begin{thebibliography}{99}
\bibitem[Paper 1]{ref1}Auth, AB,  \newblock \emph{Journal}, \textbf{Vol
2}, \newblock 123, 2001.
\bibitem[Paper 2]{ref2}Bauth, AB,  \newblock \emph{Journal}, \textbf{Vol

\end{thebibliography}
}

Message-ID: <op.wamyx0cv2bm874@bc.ursus.pris.ca>

Sorry to bother you but I have looked on the net and various sites and  
haven't found an answer to the question: Is there a way to make links in  
LyX live links? I know they are live when the book is converted to a pdf  
if you set it that way in 'Document > Settings > Pdf Properties', but I  
mean live and clickable in Lyx. Obviously there is no way with the 'Insert  
> Hyperlink' route, but has anybody, ahem... figured a hack to get live  
links working. I want to use Lyx to help me study Spanish, and internet  
access from the LyX file to the net would be great.

if they are only needed for the book, just keep them in the same folder 
as the book files.

compiled just fine. I hope some of you can learn from my mistake.

And what's the problem?

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{dsfont}
\begin{document}
\begin{equation}\mathds{C} = A\end{equation}
\end{document}

Works fine both with pdflatex and xelatex.

Subject: [texhax] context newbie
Message-ID: <20120312134736.GZ8314@digitaltorque.ca>

Hi,

I've installed the latest context standalone, and I grabbed the latest ConTeXt
manual, and they don't always seem to agree with one another.

For example, on page 145 the manual speaks of \startappendicies and
\stopappendicies, but if I use those tags, I'm told that they are unknown.

I'm trying to do a simple preface, main body and appendix structure with
proper page numbering in each, reflected in the table of contents, and I'm
finding it difficult.

Is there a more recent manual?

Thank you,
mps

I don't know what the manual says, but from the wiki
(http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Reference/en/appendix) I would say
you have to much "i"s in your commands. This works for me in a not
completly recent context:

\starttext abc

\startappendices
\chapter{Appendix: Some stuff}
% ...
\stopappendices

\stoptext 


> Is there a more recent manual?

I'm not a context user but my impression is that the context
document often lags behind.

*sigh* Yep, thanks.

I'm an old time LaTeX user, but I'm comparing with ConTeXt, as customizing
output was always somewhat challenging in LaTeX, and I was never a big fan of
LaTeX tables. I love the html-style ConTeXt tables.

I'm comparing several environments right now, from LibreOffice, to some TeX
solutions, to Sphinx, etc. I'm not a huge WYSIWYG fan, and cross platform is a
must, although I admit LibreOffice has improved greatly in recent years.

I'm pouring through the pagenumbering section now to figure out how to get
roman numerals in the frontmatter, arabic numerals in the bodymatter, and
restart the numbering in the bodymatter.

Almost there, but not as simple as I was hoping. And I'll need a custom
\totalnumberofpages in my footer for the frontmatter, because

Page ii of 7 

looks funny :)

You need \userpagenumber and \lastuserpagenumber to print the converted values of the pagenumber.

\definestructureconversionset[frontpart:pagenumber][][romannumerals]
\definestructureconversionset [bodypart:pagenumber][][numbers]
\definestructureconversionset [appendix:pagenumber][][Characters]

\setuppagenumber[numberconverionset=pagenumber]

\setupheadertexts[Page \userpagenumber\ of \lastuserpagenumber]

Hi all

I know that there is a longdiv.tex that is widely available (written by Barbara Beeton) which fills in all the blanks, and the xlop package that will do it in the (French?) way.

However would there be something where I could easily typeset it without all the "answers" that Barbara's longdiv command produces?

(See: http://www.atscire.de/index.php?nav=products/polynom)

on tex live, there is a file longdiv.tex that

parenthesis to make the output look decent.

i'm not sure what you mean by "all the answers".
is what you want just the quotient and the
remainder?

Message-ID: <EC1F4A46189A4A1DA8E16A4C8F4CD997@Alisterlaptop>

Hello again everyone.
Can anyone give me some practical advice on using LuLu (etc.) to print PDFs 
produced by LaTeX and friends?
I use the Memoir class and have lots of floating and fixed diagrams, tables 
and pictures, all of which come out in the PDF nicely.  The LuLu site 
appears to indicate that with the right setup, it can cope, but the nature 
of these tweaks/options is unclear.  I dared to ask a simple question about 
it on the LuLu bulletin board and received a most unhelpful reply from 
someone who didn't even understand "stock size" or "type block" and accused 
me of being 20 years out of date!  I was not happy.
So, If anyone has used LuLu to print their typeset PDFs, please let me know 
how you did it.

Cheers,

Alister

   Yes, I suppose (am I wrong?) that Hubert ask for xlop feature where 
some numbers can be typeset in white (or what you want). For example to 
obtain:

        949
    -------
13 ) 12345

      -----
        645

        ---


        ---
          8

rather than

        949
    -------
13 ) 12345

Sounds interesting. I've been considering publishing a book via LuLu.

Was that from an official LuLu person or just a random person on a board 
(I;m not familiar with LuLus bulleting board)

A good question - as far as I can see, he's just a random member so I'm not 
putting much store in what he says.  So far no official reply.
As a matter of interest, it looks as if a PDF made nicely from LaTeX etc of 
the book internals, but not the title/cover material, it will probably turn 
out well on the likes of LuLu, Blurb and the new Amazon CreateSpace.  Much 
more testing required!

All the best,

That person is an excellent example of why I despise vanity presses and the sort of person they attract.

Use OpenType fonts, embed completely if possible or use pdflatex and the package to make the files PDF/A compliant.

Mostly it just works, but since Lulu sends stuff out to sub-contractors, glitches may arise w/ a specific sub, then vanish when another is used.

I have printed pdfLaTeX generated documents with Lulu.com. I have used 
the koma book class and a5 sized paper. Covers was created subsequently 
from the specifications generated by lulu.com during the upload of the 
book contents. The documents contains lots of screen shots and several 
diagrams generated with TikZ. The main font I used was TeX Gyre Heros. I 
have never needed to perform any tweeks or special configuration to 
accomodate Lulu.com.

Almost everybody uses beamer?at least among of mathematicians. It is a
part of TeXLive, very well documented

I've been using powerdot.  I use a very simple slide format (just blue
strips at the top and bottom,
http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/ftp/powerdot-zen.sty).  It works nicely
with pstricks.  Generally I position the current point with

\vspace{8.6cm}\hspace{0cm}% start at lower left point

One can temporarily put a grid up (by removing the comment):
%\psgrid(0,0)(-20,-20)(20,20)%

Then I place objects using rput:

\rput[bl]{0}(1.0,0.3){%
 {\rotatebox{0}{%
   {\scalebox{0.40}{\includegraphics*{slidesfigs/bits.eps}}}%
   }%
 }%
}%

This makes it really easy to position parts of the slide.
Paragraphs can be placed inside an rput:

     \parbox[t][3.0cm][t]{3.0cm}{% \parbox[c][\height][t]{\width}%

Sometimes I even nest rputs so that there are parts of the slide that
move together as a unit.

Well, unless it is a really special custom-made design, I guess one can
spot which package had been used. Why should one want to have this
information in the PDF? I mean, you don't write "proudly made with
Powerpoint" in your PPTs, or?

If you upload the slides somewhere we might check it out.

To aid you in finding the package check the Beamer and Powerdot
documentation:

1) Does the presentation look like one of the templates mentioned in the
manuals?

2) Do the slides feature something which would speak for one special
package (e.g. clearly recognizable PSTricks would point to Powerdot)

3) Does it have the navigation buttons from Beamer?

If a custom theme was used it may be quite difficult to tell.

I personally prefer powerdot as it's PSTricks friendly.

Unfortunately the downside to powerdot is that it bloats quite quickly when transitions are included. 

That's where Acrobat's Save as Optimised PDF function works well. It almost always manages to squish the file down as ghostscript is terrible with managing file sizes :p

In general no, but to some degree it can be guessed.

You can put the classes, packages, ... (the stuff that \listfiles
outputs at the end of the LaTeX run) in the creator field
of the PDF informations:

\documentclass{beamer}

\makeatletter
\newcommand*{\FileList}{}
\begingroup
  \@for\@currname:=\@filelist\do{%
    \filename at parse\@currname
    \edef\reserved at a{%
      \filename at base.%
      \ifx\filename at ext\relax tex\else\filename at ext\fi
    }%
    \expandafter
    \let\expandafter\reserved at b\csname ver@\reserved at a\endcsname
    \ifx\reserved at b\relax
      \let\reserved at b\@empty
    \fi
    \ifx\FileList\@empty
    \else
      \xdef\FileList{\FileList, }%
    \fi
    \ifx\reserved at b\@empty
      \xdef\FileList{\FileList \reserved at a}%
    \else
      \xdef\FileList{\FileList \reserved at a\space(\reserved at b)}%
    \fi
  }%   
\endgroup
\hypersetup{pdfcreator=\FileList}% takes some time
\makeatother

\begin{document}
Hello World.  
\end{document}

But it's quite a lengthy list and some of the auxiliary files could be
filtered out.

Yours sincerely

Oh!  That's interesting.  I found this option in Adobe Acrobat
Professional, File / Save As / Format / Adobe PDF Files, Optimized. 
It took my talk about the evolution of binding sites (a paradigm for
how information appears in living things) from 1223080 bytes down to
770944 bytes (63% original size).

Very nice.  I put these examples at

http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/papers/ev/
http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/papers/ev/evtalk.pdf 
http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/papers/ev/evtalk-compressed.pdf

I used pstricks extensively in this talk.  A cool example starts on
page 52.  The curved arrows were generated using the lovely Bezier
curve option.

\psbezier[linewidth=2pt,showpoints=false]{->}(5,0.0)(3.7,0.0)(3.7,0.5)(3.69,1.0)

One defines four points (which you can see by setting showpoints to
'true' - in cm.  So one has very fine control of positioning.

As you can see, my 'zen' style is very simple:  just a blue strip on
top and bottom into which you can place text if you want.  Even that
could be removed.  So it's probably not possible to tell this was
generated with powerdot.

Does anyone know how to use the Acrobat optimization from the command
line so that it can be embedded into scripts?

That information can be added to the pdf
by filling in the hyperref keywords

I'll have to read the hyperref manual to find the correct keyword; 
see below for link.

Here are what little I know about the keyword list:

First you need your video file in MP4 Format (preferably encoded with the
h.264 codec). You can use ffmpeg to convert existing video files

  ffmpeg -i Sample.mov -vcodec libx264 Sample.mp4

or one of the numerous online-services available, such as
www.mediaconverter.org (select `h264' and `aac' as codecs for video and
audio under `advanced options').

A sequence of numbered bitmaps, such as frame-0.png, frame-1.png, ... 
can be converted to a high quality video at small file size by

  ffmpeg -i frame-%d.png -vcodec libx264 myvideo.mp4

The MP4 is embedded together with a media player flash-app, such as
VPlayer.swf, which is already installed with media9.sty. If you prefer a
full-featured media player, I recommend StrobeMediaPlayback.swf. You can
get it from SourceForge.net (it's open-source):

http://sourceforge.net/projects/smp.adobe/files/Strobe%20Media%20Playback%201.6%20Release%20%28source%20and%20binaries%29/StrobeMediaPlayback_1.6.328-full.zip/download

StrobeMediaPlayback.swf resides in a subfolder of the expanded ZIP. Put it
into your working directory or any other directory. Use \addmediapath{...}
to configure the search path in the latter case.

Alexander

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage[english]{babel} %media9.sty needs it (language doesn't matter)
  
  \usepackage{media9}
  % in case you put your video files into a sub-folder, add it to the
  % search path:
  \addmediapath{./files} %mymovie6.mp4, StrobeMediaPlayback.swf
  
  \usepackage{graphicx}
  % the same for graphics files
  \graphicspath{{./files/}} %mymovie6.jpg
  
  \begin{document}
  \begin{enumerate}

    \includemedia[

Subject: [texhax] Adding bookmarks to present
Message-ID: <01df01cd05f8$539ae1e0$fad0a5a0$@yahoo.com>


Hello,

Background:  The beamer example beamerexample-conference-talk.pdf has the
slides organized into bookmarks (with the bookmarks containing multiple
levels).  Right clicking on a few bookmarks and exploring their properties
shows that the document has a collection of "named destinations" and each
bookmark has the action to "go to" a particular named destination;  and the
organization of bookmarks into multi-levels can be manipulated by "selecting
bookmarks and dragging with a mouse".  

I would like to add multi-level bookmarks to the output of present too
(http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/present).

Turns out HowToTalkTeX.pdf has three named destination (Further, Images, and
title), and examining HowToTalkTeX.tex, one can see what caused these named
destinations to exist in the pdf.

Question:  how does embed into the pdf from a present presentation a
particular organization of named destinations into multi-level bookmarks?

Thanks,

--Suresh

  Since then, I have came across:

      http://tug.org/applications/hyperref/ftp/doc/slides.pdf

  which has an really neat tree of bookmarks.  However, I have
  not been able to find the source used to create slides.pdf --
  if these sources are available to the public, where are they?

  I realize that the sources for slides.pdf are likely to be in
  LaTex whereas present is in (and my interest is in) plain TeX.

Subject: [texhax] how to last-name-first for all authors with biblatex
Message-ID: <4F67FBFA.8070504@binghamton.edu>

I'm trying to convert myself from bibtex to biblatex, and I'm having 
trouble figuring out how to get bibliography entries to look like:

1.  Author AB, Otherauthor CD, and Lastauthor FG.  ......

I'm on Ubuntu 10.04, which has unfortunately a rather old version of 
Biblatex: 0.81.

Here's what I've tried so far, in my preamble:

\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[style=numeric-comp, sorting=none, firstinits=true, 
terseinits=true, minnames=3, maxnames=6]{biblatex}
\DeclareNameAlias{labelname}{last-first}
\bibliography{HeatWaveReferences}

I use \supercite{} as my cite command.

This produces:

1.  AB Author, CD Otherauthor, and FG Lastauthor  .....

I'd be grateful for any advice.

Thanks.

Hello,
  
  Earlier, I asked about adding bookmarks to the plain TeX
  presentation "package" present http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/present
  
  I finally figured it out!  By reading the pdflatex manual!
  
  Briefly, here's how to modify present's manual
  HowToTalkTeX.tex to get it to show bookmarks:
  
  1) run pdftex on HowToTalkTeX.tex and open the resulting pdf
     -- when I do so, I get an error message -- which I ignore.
     This step is here just to show that this error message is
     not caused by the following Steps (2,3).

  2) Add the following toward the top of the file:

   %%
   \pdfcatalog{
     /PageMode /UseOutlines
   }
   %%
   \pdfoutline goto name {title}                          { How To Do A Talk

   \pdfoutline goto name {bmmotivation}                   { Motivation

   \pdfoutline goto name {bmrequirements}                 { Requirements

   \pdfoutline goto name {basicexamples}         count -2 { Basic Examples
}
   \pdfoutline goto name {basicexamples}                  { Basic Examples
1/2       }
   \pdfoutline goto name {basicexamplesb}                 { Basic Examples
2/2       }
   %\pdfoutline goto name {bmordinarystuff}                { Ordinary stuff
}
   \pdfoutline goto page 6 {/Fit}                         { Ordinary Stuff

   \pdfoutline goto name {bmfonts}                        { Fonts

Images        }
   \pdfoutline goto name {bmconcludingremarks}            { Concluding

   %%

  3) Create targets by modifying appropriate lines 
     by adding "\target{}" as indicated below:

A Lucida OpenType font distribution is now available from TUG --
http://tug.org/lucida has documents, samples, and ordering information.

These new OpenType fonts contain many more characters than the Lucida
Type 1 fonts (which remain available, by the way).  There is also a full
OpenType math font that works with LuaTeX and XeTeX, as well as non-TeX
programs.

Many people contributed to the effort, but primary thanks must go to
Bigelow & Holmes for doing the design work (of course!), and
Khaled Hosny for the technical work.

We all hope others will find these new fonts useful and beautiful :).

I don't understand the purpose and perhaps I have misunderstood
the question.

\documentclass{article}

\newenvironment{nopar}{\let\par\relax}{}

\begin{document}

\begin{nopar}
First paragraph.

I'm looking for a way to program a latex environment with several

There is no need for a package to do this.  If I understand the problem, all 
that should be necessary is to leave a blank line when you wish to end a 
paragraph.

I don't this that is what the OP wants. He wants something similar to this

\begin{env}
paragraph 1

paragraph 2

paragraph 3
\end{env}

resulting in

paragraph 1 paragraph 2 paragraph 3

i.e. typeset as if there was no blank lines.

As already answered elsewhere, this can be done by simply redefinining 
\par within the nevironment.

Maybe it's me, but I do not in the least understand what you want. minipage
for example is a latex environment, and it may contain many paragraphs. So
that's possible, but I guess that's not really what you meant to ask for.
Could you elaborate on what you need?

No.  Please read the question again, this time more carefully.

And there is no "Mohamed HOUSSNI problem" at all.

The error report was due to I put the \cite inside the figure caption.
so the hyrperref report error as above. But without hyperref package,
no error being reported.

\cite is a fragile command. Try \protect\cite{...} inside the figure
caption.

It's involves the figure caption part and reference from some a bit
heavy thesis.

I tried to build a new one, but choked. anyway, I uploaded whole into
following link.

Please do have a look and give me some feedback, I spend 30 minutes to
prepare for this template.

The only cite command in a caption I found was in toxicmech.tex, line 8:
Old line:     \caption[The density function .\cite{metabolism}}

You have one square and one curly bracket. I changed the square into a
curly and added a \protect command
   \caption{The density function \protect\cite{metabolism}}

And the document works just fine for me (again using pdfTeX, Version
3.1415926-2.3-1.40.12 (TeX Live 2011) on Mac OS X)

You probably already knows this, but the square brackets are for
alternative caption in table of figures.
    \caption[Alternative caption for table of figures]{The density
function \protect\cite{metabolism}}

How about using the 'unpublished' style instead? As it is not published 
in 'traditional sense'

in that style there is a 'howpublished' key, which one can use to 
specify the url.

There's a "cite this page" link near the top right of that web page,
which gives some good clues as to what to fill in the other fields.
Looks to me like @Incollection would be the most appropriate record
type.

Thanks,

Before I used middle button click it just to open the same page in a new Tab.
so I didn't notice this before.

Yes, it works well in the @Incollection, (I barely could think of
using it without you mentioned it.)

@Incollection{FADpropotion,
  author =       "Thomas D. Bird",
  title =        "Alzheimer Disease Overview",
  booktitle =      "GeneReviews$^{TM}$ [Internet]",

  organization = "Seattle (WA): University of Washington",
  address =	 "Seattle",
  month =   	 "Oct.",
  volume =       "",
  number =       "",
  pages =        "",
  doi =          "",
}

Thanks again,

Subject: [texhax] problems with texlive installation
Message-ID: <CAA2z38iynN-r0H-80JUXVUqL6wXWhzUQPuyinOsiqkiCCBiEfw@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to install texlive on my laptop running on windows 7. I
could not use the file install-tl, but could use the advanced version.
However, it does not find several of the packages which I routinely
use ; beamerthemesplit.sty being one of them. How can I configure the
texlive/texmaker combination so that it will find whatever packages
are needed, and install them automatically?

When I installed texlive on my desktop running windows vista, I could
run both install-tl and the advanced version, and found the folder
containing beamerthemesplit.sty automatically there. I copied the
folder to laptop, but that does not work.

I am not computer savvy, so it is hard to understand the discussions
on the blog. I will appreciate step by step instructions. If you wish
to call me, my number is 626-914-7002.

Thank you very much. With best regards, Hrushikesh

When you latex or pdflatex the file below, the
	\titleref{sec-1}
evaluates to the chapter name where \label{sec-1} is
located, (i.e. "Dummy Chapter") instead of the section
name.  I believe this is wrong behaviour.

If you comment out the \usepackage{titlesec}, the reference
is correct (i.e. "First").

What's the best way to get round this?

  Thanks,

%  In the default operation, the titles are recorded by a command inserted
%  into the various sectioning commands ("\@sect", "\@ssect", "\@chapter",
%  "\@schapter", "\@part", "\@spart", and "\@caption").  If this creates
%  conflicts with some other package, you can use an entirely different
%  method by specifying "\usepackage[usetoc]{titleref}".  As the name
%  implies, this option records the titles from the table-of-contents
%  entry without redefining the sectioning commands.  (This is the method
%  used in older versions.)

titleref does not use LaTeX's \@sect or \@ssect.

Can you tell us which Linux distribution you're using, how did you 
install TeXLive (tlmgr is the updater ---the installer is install-tl*) 
and how did you set the path to TeXLive binaries?

Thanks for replying.

1. Debian linux.
2. install-tl-20111110, with "install-tl"

A fix I'm currently using is to add
:/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/tex//

to the TEXINPUTS environment variable.

Not sure I follow your questions.

The distro is debian linux, and I've used the install-tl script (ver 20111110) from CTAN.

For example, hhtensor.sty which was installed into?
/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/tex/latex/hhtensor/hhtensor.sty

is not found, unless I add?

/usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf-dist/tex//

to TEXINPUTS

TIA

what does

which latex

say?

does that correspond to the one you have just installed.

If not, make sure to change your PATH

if you execute the command

which latex

it will tell you where latex is. I'd like to know if it is inside 
/usr/local/texlive/2011/ or not

If it is not, then we know what is wrong

"which latex" gives
/usr/bin/latex

This may suggest that you have two LaTeX installations on this computer.

You will need to make sure that the correct TL bin dir comes first in 
the PATH.

You're using Debian, which seems to be doing thing a little differently 
than Ubuntu (which I normally use), so you will have to figure out how 
one perform a global change to the system PATH

Some may say that you should add it via say bashrc. In my experience, 
this is usually not enough because then programmes started via a menu 
will not see this change and will continue to use the old LaTeX

the install-tl script was run after a fresh install of a debian system, and I did not select the debian latex packages. so seems to me unlikely another latex system was installed (say during the the debian netinstall process).

if you have the space, leave them, they may help on editor dependencies 
(which may exaplain why you got them in the first place)

I'm adding texhax again (such that this can be found in the archives)

Now you just have to figure out how you change the system path on a debian.

I failed the last time I tried.

Nice diagnosis, Lars! To the OP:

To add the path to TeXLive binaries in Debian (or rather, to prepend 
said path, which is what you need), *open as administrator* 
/etc/login.defs; find two lines like these:

	ENV_SUPATH	PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:
			     /usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
	ENV_PATH	PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:
			     /usr/local/games:/usr/games

Now ---in ENV_SUPATH put, *before* /usr/local/sbin the path to TeXLive 
binaries; if you're Debian is 64 bits it should be

	/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux:

If it is 32 bits, it will be different at the end: check in 
/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/ which binaries you have and put said line 
exactly as you see it.

So ENV_SUPATH will be (assuming 64bit):

	ENV_SUPATH	PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux:
				/usr/local/sbin: etc.

don't forget the colon!

Do the same with ENV_PATH and restart. Now which latex should output

	/usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux/latex

and you won't need the TEXINPUTS line, with which, by the way, you are 
using the Debian binaries with TeXLive packages!


Best

Axel

Thanks Axel, I've saved this for later use on Debian systems. Did not

As you said, it's different in Ubuntu (and Linux Mint), where prepending 
the path in /etc/environment is enough.

But, at least in Linux Mint, you also have /etc/login.defs, with said lines

	ENV_SUPATH
	ENV_PATH

but I haven't use login.defs with Ubuntu or Mint.

If you mean between Ubuntu and Mint, to start with, I don't remember if 
Ubuntu has login.defs ---most likely it does.

But beyond that, Mint started as basically an Ubuntu redistribution with 
non-libre codecs that might cause problems in countries with software 
patents (the USA and Japan, as far as I know), codecs that are not part 
of the Ubuntu default installation (that is, not in the DVD, but you can 
install on your own).

But with the recent move of Ubuntu as a competitor for MacOS-iOS and 
Microsoft 8 (one interface does it all ---desktop, tablet and 
television), which has alienated many traditional desktop users like me, 
Mint is gradually moving away from Ubuntu and getting closer to Debian; 
and it does provide various alternatives to the also controversial Gnome 
3 (like Mate and Cinnamon, as well as Mint Gnome Extensions), and 
*doesn't* provide Unity.

Only hours keep you apart from the cheap BachoTeX 2012 registration
deadline on 31st of March.To whet you appetite:

-- the emergence of OpenType TG Math - finally!
-- math typesetting by the experts
-- mlBibTeX ready for use with biblatex
-- e-books: the future now?
-- MFLua does OpenType fonts
-- fun around the "real" book: papermaking, calligraphy, lithography, 
bookbinding
-- ConTeXt now and future
-- Twenty years after: will we be around in twenty years?
-- the TeX Pearls session - surprises as usuall

... and much more. Bachotek is the place to be!

Although the program is already extremely interesting, we will still
accept submissions until Tuesday, April 10 -- please see the call
for papers at http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2012/cfp
but do not limit yourself to the main conference topic.

And again: cheap registrations are still open at

Oh, I see! ENV_SUPATH sets the path for the superuser, and ENV_PATH for 
normal users.
