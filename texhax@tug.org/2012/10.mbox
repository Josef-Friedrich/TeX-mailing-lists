Subject: [texhax] macro expansion and \input
Message-ID: <87d312h6wu.wl%neal@walfield.org>

Hi,

I have a number of generated files containing latex snippets.  So far,
I've include them in my document using \input.  But, to make life a
bit easier, I want to use a macro to generate the full filenames on
the fly.  This is resulting in some macro expansion issues, which I
don't understand.  The following is what I want to do:

  \documentclass{article}
  
  \begin{document}
  
  % My general-purpose macro.
  \def\mutate#1{
    \def\helper{#1}
    \helper
  }
  
  \input{\mutate{23}}
  
  \end{document}

But, this results in:

  ! Missing control sequence inserted.
  <inserted text> 
                  \inaccessible 
  l.11 \input{\mutate{23}}

It seems like \input is protecting its input from expansion.
Interestingly, simple expansion, such as the following, works fine:

  \documentclass{article}

  \begin{document}

  \def\filename{12}
  \input{\filename}

  \end{document}

Based on this observation, I tried to preexpand \input's argument:

  \documentclass{article}
  
  \begin{document}
  
  % My general-purpose macro.
  \def\mutate#1{
    \def\helper{#1}
    \helper
  }
  
  \def\myinput#1{
    \edef\filename{#1}
    \input{\filename}
  }

  \myinput{\mutate{23}}
  
  \end{document}

But, this results in a different error:

  ! Undefined control sequence.
  \mutate #1-> \def \helper 
                            {#1} \helper 
  l.16   \myinput{\mutate{23}}
                              
When expanding \filename, tex wants expands \mutate's \helper control
sequence rather than define it!

Now, I'm stuck and would welcome some help...


Thanks,

Neal

Neal, as you do not give us any information as to exactly how
you want to mutate the filename, I cannot be certain that the
following will work, but for my simple version which just
prepends the letter "X" it seems adequate.  It is based
on your \myinput, but puts /all/ of the functionality there
rather than requiring \mutate to be passed as a part of
the parameter string.

\def must be executed in normal processing to be effective. It is
not a macro (or other command) that works by expansion.  It is not
"expandable".

Why not make the \input part of your definition?

>     \edef\filename{#1}
>     \input{\filename}

>

Again, \edef expansion does not process \def.

I mean

\def\mutateinput#1{%
  \def\helper{#1}%
  \input{\helper}%
}

Note I removed the blank spaces you were inserting.

Copy caslr.mf in from your old distribution into an appropriate place in the new and re-fresh the filename database (unless you put it somewhere that doesn't need the refresh --- it should work if in the same directory as the .tex file).

Thanks!!

The solution, apparently, is to add '[]' for powerdot slides:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1pt,labelsep=3pt,itemsep=6pt]

becomes

\begin{itemize}[][leftmargin=1pt,labelsep=3pt,itemsep=6pt]

This worked while in a PowerDot slide but FAILS for normal LaTeX!

Why was this done and where is the "documentation" about it?

The consequence of this is that one cannot use the same code
for different presentations (eg by reading in with \input{}).

Could this be fixed?

Then you should remove the reference to it from your .tex file.

I am aware of: comment, optional, tagging, version, versions,
and xcomment. Precede "ctan.org/pkg/" for learning more about 
each of them, e.g.

This is from technote.pdf that in fact Ulrike Fischer pointed to,

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2012-September/019740.html

rather belonging to the enemy alliance.

> So the reason is that is decidedly non-latex in style and (my own take):

Indeed (from technote.pdf):

    The problem is that when LATEX was originally created, 
    it adopted most of its mathematics features straight 
    from plain.tex. But in the case of \matrix, \pmatrix, 
    \cases this was a mistake?the plain.tex syntax for them 
    is decidedly non-LATEX in style.

? "a mistake", boldly. It is a "mistake" in my view to confuse 
/support/ of the typical LaTeX syntax with /restriction/ to the
latter. The argument seems to be that /support/ without 
/restriction/ is a kind of "intentional inconsistency". 
I cannot find the English words for German "inkonsequent" 
and "wer A sagt, muss auch B sagen", deceptive tricks to 
convince stupid people in political affairs. However, I 
consider it OK, as others have done in the discussion, 
if a publisher or journal in fact /restricts/ markup syntax 
in submissions.

For that purpose, it may be a good idea to redefine Plain TeX 
macros or even some primitives so they produce error messages 
saying "Please replace #1 by ... according to the guidelines 
for submissions". However, it may be difficult to defeat the 
Plain TeX guerilla for good, who will reintroduce Plain TeX 
constructs by \newcommand under new names, such as \xirtam. 
I have just started to think how you can attack the journal's 
LaTeX guard in your submission, and how the guard in turn can 
protect the journal from certain types of Plain TeX attacks 
in advance, and what new types of attacks could be invented
... finally you might submit something not for the reputation 
of getting something published, rather just for enjoying a 
successful Plain TeX attack.

As to \over, \frac /might/ solve a certain problem by "controlled" 
use of the primitive, restricting appearance of the primitive 
to contexts where it cannot corrupt the result of typesetting, 
maybe only /after/ the math style has been determined (by the 
outermost \frac). The technote.pdf passage is not clear about 
whether the primitive actually sometimes results in bad 
typesetting, or whether it is just a matter of efficiency and
performance (with nested \mathchoice's). Maybe \frac has indeed 
saved minutes (fractions of hours) per TeX run in papers about 
fractions in the 1990s, does anybody know?

Citing from technote.pdf what Michael Barr cites:

    I construe LATEX?s provision of \frac, and the lack 
    of any mention in the LATEX book of the primitive 
    fraction commands, as an implicit injunction against 
    their use, although I don?t think Lamport actually 
    spent a lot of time pondering the issue,

... some strange guessing, "implicit injunction" ? 
perhaps Lamport was not aware of all the implications 
of his work? Idle. Nonsense.

In fact, the \kernel at ifnextchar macro in latex.ltx restores 
LaTeX's original \@ifnextchar. It has been a response to 
AMS LaTeX's attack on LaTeX by redefining \@ifstar.
Citing from source2e.pdf:

    \kernel at ifnextchar

    This macro is the kernel version of \@ifnextchar which 
    is used in a couple of places to prevent the AMS variant 
    from being used since in some places this produced chaos 
    (for example if an fd file is loaded in a random place 
    then the optional argument to \ProvidesFile could get 
    printed there instead of being written only in the log file. 
    This happened when there was a space or a newline between 
    the mandatory and optional arguments! It should really be 
    fixed in the amsmath package one day, but...

Ulrike Fischer as above:

  In for a penny, in for a pound.     Wer A sagt, muss auch B sagen.
  You must finish what you start.     Wer A sagt, muss auch B sagen.

However, I think that the discussion about LaTeX2e isn't overly
helpful because it's frozen forever.  LaTeX developers are working on
LaTeX3 now and I'm convinced that it will be much more consistent.

This is at least partly done by the onlyamsmath package and I suppose
that l2tabu has the same goal.

If they exactly know what they are doing, it's probably not a big
problem.

I'm not convinced that Plain TeX is less secure than LaTeX.  As you
said yourself, there is \newcommand.  TeX Live provides protection
already:

  shell_escape.tex = f
  shell_escape.initex = f

  % Allow TeX \openin, \openout, or \input on filenames starting with `.'
  % (e.g., .rhosts) or outside the current tree (e.g., /etc/passwd)?
  % a (any)        : any file can be opened.
  % r (restricted) : disallow opening "dotfiles".
  % p (paranoid)   : as `r' and disallow going to parent directories, and
  %                  restrict absolute paths to be under $TEXMFOUTPUT.
  openout_any = p
  openin_any = a

Since files in parent directories cannot be [over]written, it's safe
to put non-trusted stuff into subdirs and load it with
\include{dir/file}.  The default setting of openin_any is quite
insecure, it's easy enough to write TeX code which puts your private
ssh key into a PDF file, even invisibly.  If you have to process
material from people you don't trust, it's advisable to change this
setting.

You, as a TeX programmer, probably have something different in mind:
If a publisher has to \include many files, one file could break files
included later.  This can be solved by including each file within a
group, but I'm not sure whether it's safe to \let\aftergroup\relax.
Not to mention \global, \globaldefs, ...

I'm leaving for EuroTeX-2012 in a few hours and will be offline until
next weekend.

Regards,
  Reinhard

If you can't find the file, how can the system be finding and using the file?

Then there has to be a copy of caslr.mf, or the bitmap files derived from it available in texlive2007.

Try expanding the search to caslr*.* and see what is found.

If you have a .pdf generated which includes the caslr font, I'd be curious to see it.

Really though, this is the 21st century --- wouldn't it be better to use a modern font w/ a modern encoding?

Subject: [texhax] column breaks in eplain
Message-ID: <CAEByO6gFonZFhztcBtF--pComG4fmffhUhCMEftb0WZKbOPS1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm new to TeX and experimenting with eplain's columns feature, but I
don't seem to be able to get column breaks to work as expected. An
example:

\input eplain
\hsize 188mm \vsize 188mm
\hoffset 5mm \voffset 5mm
\nopagenumbers
\doublecolumns
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad
minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla
pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in
culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
\columnfill
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad
minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla
pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in
culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
\hrule
\bye

I would expect the two lorem ipsum paragraphs to be side-by-side, in
the two columns on the first page. Instead, the last line of the first
column gets forced into the top of the second column, which seems to
force the second paragraph onto the next page. This doesn't seem
specific to this example - however I try, \columnfill seems to pull
the last line of the paragraph into the next column.

Any advice for how to fix this?

Gratefully,
J

i don't claim to be a regular eplain user,
but when \columnfill is encountered, tex
is still in horizpntal mode.

try putting \par or a blank line before
the \columnfill to switch to vertical mode.

A \par in the appropriate place doesn't appear to make a difference.

Hi,
I'm looking for the above in order to create a pronunciation

The glossary in TeX by Topic contains a fair number of the primitives 
but not all of them.

Any help would be most appreciated
many thanks,

The following Perl script generates a list of command names that
are used in plain.tex. The list does not include active characters
and primitives that are not used in plain.tex explicitly.

%%% plaincmds.pl %%%

my %cmd;

chomp(my $file_plain = `kpsewhich plain.tex`);

    s/(\\[^a-zA-Z]|\\[a-zA-Z@]+)/addcmd($1)/ge;
    s/\\newif\\if([a-zA-Z@]+)/addcmd("\\$1true");addcmd("\\$1false")/ge;
}

sub addcmd ($) {
    my $cmd = shift;
    $cmd{$cmd} = 1;
    return $cmd;
}

map { print "$_\n"; } (sort keys %cmd);

Hi there Deyan and thanks for the response. Actually, my system is 
set up so that pure TeX source fares better than an XML solution. As 
for the pronunciation dictionary the general file structure is very 
conveniently minimulistic:
         /^[a-z]+?=[a-z ]+$/i
(almost) for each entry

Cheers
Paul

A brilliant solution, Heiko, and one which I am sure will
help Paul greatly.  In view of your closing caveat above,
I wonder if you might be able to write an analous Perl
script to extract the definitive list from TeX.pool :

	http://www.saildart.org/TEX.POO%5BPAS,DEK%5D

and then the two lists could be merged ?

hi, paul,

    I'm looking for the above in order to create a pronunciation dictionary for
    my speech synth.

    The glossary in TeX by Topic contains a fair number of the primitives but
    not all of them.

from a quick look at the file tex.web it
appears that all the entries destined for
the index by use of the prefatory string
  \.{\\
are primitives.  what follows the third
backslash can be either a string of letters
or a single non-letter.  of course there
are numerous duplicates, but given knuth's
propensity for careful documentation, i
expect the results of extracting all these
entries would yield a complete list.

separately, i've sent paul a copy of a
list of all control sequences in plain and
ams-tex, but as mentioned already, not all
primitives are necessarily used in plain,
so the plain/amstex list may not be
complete in that regard.

tex.pool contains strings. Some of them are command tokens, but
other are not and unhappily these strings are mixed up.

I have added the summary chapters of texbook.tex and
etex_man.tex to get new tokens.

Easy.

Subject: [texhax]  change margins for some pages in a doc
Message-ID: <20121012085253.GA16865@Magnolia>

Dear list,

My document class is \documentclass[english,12pt]{scrartcl}

I need to add on a few pages large .xls tables and wish them to fill
more space, e.g dismish top,bottom,let and right margins. This should
only be applicaple to some pages, not the whole doc.

Best would be to have access to 1 and 2 in the usual page layout
graphic.
1 one inch +\offset (left space)
2 one inch +\voffset (top space)
but I have no idea how to change these values.


Playing with scale \includegraphics[scale=1]{xl1.pdf} is not satisfying.
\pagebreak \enlargethispage does nothing
\renewcommand{textwidth}{npt} does nothing

I do not understand very well the fancyhdr package. Maybe it is the
solution?

Thank you for help

The package "geometry" solves your problem.
In the preamble:
\usepackage[left=3cm,right=3cm,a4paper]{geometry} (change the values to the
correct margins, see the documentation for more options).

In the document, you can use \newgeometry{left=1cm,right=1cm,top=1cm} to
change the left,right and top margins to one cm.
Simply use the command \restoregeometry when you want to go back to the
orginal margins.

This should be possible with the current version of the geometry-package.

is best, as I can see number page. But still strugling to have a bigger
height for the .xls table.

Using : \newgeometry{left=0pt,top=0pt,bottom=0pt,includehead} is not too
bad, but not perfect.

Please find attached a short view of my document + the .xls file to
include.
As you will see, 
1- the header is distorted on page 3
2- the .xls feet width but not height. Must be a ratio issue 
3- page 3 is not numbered.

Thank you for your help.

I have recently up loaded Texshop 3.11 on a Mac OSX version 10.7.4 on a MacBook Air.  I want to make my own template but I can't find where to store it.  I have no file chain \library\Texshop\templates which I used on version 10.6.8.  Where do I put my Template so that it shows in the template pull-down.

It's not surprising that you can't find the directory if you use "\"s :-}

But all seriousness aside, try "~/Library/TeXShop/Templates" (no quotes).  Also, the mailing list "macosx-tex at email.esm.psu.edu" may be better for questions about TeX that are specific to Mac OS X.  See <http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex> for details.

Message-ID: <208425568.103571.1350422402786.JavaMail.root@math.uzh.ch>

I cannot get the media9 package to work.

Error:
I try to compile the file test.tex:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[english]{babel}  % Rumored to be required by media9, language irrelevant
\usepackage{media9}  
\begin{document}
\end{document}

using

# pdflatex test.tex

LaTeX Error: File `media9.sty' not found.

Double check:

# apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
texlive-latex-extra is already the newest version.

texlive-latex-extra contains media9 according to this list: 
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/quantal/+package/texlive-latex-extra

================
Attempted fixes:

0. Using tlmgr:

tlmgr: command not found. It looks like Ubuntu took it out?

1. Manually adding media9 package:

$ sudo -i
# kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFLOCAL
/usr/loca/share/texmf
# unzip media9.zip -d /usr/loca/share/texmf
# texhash
# pdflatex test.tex

This had no effect.

2. Unzip media9.zip from CTAN into my source folder.

Of course, now it found the style file, but it couldn't compile it. The error was:

! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \msg_error:nnn 
           {media9}{support outdated}{l3kernel}\tex_endinput:D 

I commented out similar lines (it looks like error handling) and produced similar errors:

! Undefined control sequence.
l.90 \pdftex_if_engine:T

etc.

================
Configuration:
* Ubuntu 12.04 
* texlive-full 

Reproduced the errors on a different version of linux with unknown tex configuration at the office. (I'm not root there)


This looks like something Google would solve in a jiffy, but I couldn't find anyone with similar problems. Much thanks to anyone who can help.

'Managed' TeX Live does not use tlmgr (the whole point of using Ubuntu's
package system is that it knows what files are available).

This really should work: what does "kpswewhich media9.sty" give after
the local installation? Doe you have the correct structure

  /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/media9/media9.sty

(the 'TDS')?

I'd expect more errors than that. media9 uses the LaTeX3 'expl3'
programming language, which is very actively developed. You will
certainly have an older version as part of TeX Live, but need the latest
one. On CTAN, you need to find l3kernel.tds.zip and l3packages.tds.zip
and install both in your local TeX tree.

Would this not just go down as another BibTeX field? (biblatex/Biber 2.0
has flexible source mapping, so adding fields is easy.)

At something of a tangent, it's not clear to me that ORCHID is any more
(or less) likely to succeed than completing approaches, such as
ResearchID. (The latter is popular in my field, at least.)

Cool.  I hadn't looked.  Thanks.

Well, given that Thomson Reuters is a launch partner with ORCID
(http://about.orcid.org/about/community/launch-partners), I have a
feeling that they may merge at some point.

The current version of LaTeX is LaTeX2e (since 1995).  So just use
LaTeX und you'll see semething like this on screen:

  This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.4-1.40.13 (TeX Live 2012)
   restricted \write18 enabled.
  entering extended mode
  LaTeX2e <2011/06/27>

Hence you can proceed as usual, unless you have a *very* old
installation.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The probability is very very high that you are already writing in
LaTeX2e, albeit without perhaps being aware of the fact.  The
"original" LaTeX is now very very old, and the fore-runner to
LaTeX2e, itself called LaTeX 2.09, has not been developed for
about fifteen years.  If your documents start with

	\documentclass

and not with

	\documentstyle

then you are already using LaTeX2e, and your existing work will be
compatible with the needs for your research paper.

With very best wishes :
Philip Taylor

Are you certain you are using texlive 2012?

In that case which one? The Ubuntu one, og the one supplied by TUG?

I assume a map file needs to be activated, did you do that? and did you first verify that kpsewhich could find the map file?

I followed the same steps to install the fonts on my previous computer (running Mac OS X) and everything worked perfectly, so I'm not sure what's going on with my current installation. I wonder if you could help me troubleshoot these problems?

Thanks for you help!

Thank you for your response!

I realized that I had a partial installation of an older version of texlive installed on the machine, so I ended up reinstalling texlive. The problem persisted, but I noticed that I had (foolishly) set the environment variable DVIPSHEADERS at some point in my desperate attempts to get the fonts working. After un-defining that variable everything seems to be working as it should.

Thanks again!

Will

According to my copy of the Companion, the command \clearpage will cause 
all pending floats to be printed.  It doesn't.  I am dealing with a paper 
in which the last float is printed on a page inserted between the first 
and second pages of the bibliogaphy.  So I inserted \clearpage before 
\begin{thebibliography}{10} and recompiled.  Exact same result.  Is there 
any way to really force the float (which in fact appears just before the 
bibliography) to print before the bibliography?

Different publishers/journals have different guidelines, 
so l2tabu badly can aim at them. I rather think that its athours

? By "Plain TeX attack" I only meant placing a Plain TeX construct in a
paper although the staff has spent years developing strategies and
macros to keep Plain TeX constructs out. A funny game against another
funny game. Or a kind of fundamentalist suicide attack.

Good to learn -- indeed, January 2012, I haven't read the CTAN 
announcements for a year -- oh no, the update hasn't been 
announced at all, annoying.

Bingo!  Although there is no redefinition of \clearpage in the ms itself, 
there are loads of packages loaded, many of which I have never heard of. 
So I put \let\CLEARPAGE\clearpage at the top of the file and replaced 
\clearpage by \CLEARPAGE before the bibliography and, mirabile dictu, it 
worked!  Thanks for the suggestion, many thanks.

This would be a way for what I called a "Plain TeX attack" elsewhere 
(one posting before was not intended, an attack from my email program).

Especially, I had thought of using MiKTeX's on-the-fly installing 
for including definitions that the editors don't want to have.

And now there even is the `texliveonfly' package!

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Installing culmus hebrew fonts on mactex
Message-ID: <CAA-PQXCo3ox82cDL8OPd9WKtaur9c1Y5SBCAdfOY=c1n3QhPxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I did install once these fonts on MacTex by following this:
http://www.tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html#fndb
Now, I've installed the new 2012 MacTex, and follow these instructions
again, but it doesn't work for me.
I also tried to follow this:
http://www.tug.org/fonts/fontinstall-personal.html
but that didn't work also.

Does anyone have an idea how to make it work?

Thank you very much!
Roi

Howdy,

Please describe where and how you actually installed the fonts. If you installed them in your personal tree did you run

updmap ...

or

sudo updmap ...

or

sudo -H updmap ...

(the last two are wrong with the last one being terribly wrong). If you put the fonts in the texmf-local tree did you run

sudo -H mktexlsr
sudo -H updmap-sys ...

or something else? What are the outputs of those commands? We need more information to figure out what happened.

Finally, how old was your previous version of MacTeX?

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

I just lent a friend of mine the tex-live disk I got from TUG.  He has a 
Mac and I have a Win box.  I know how to get started on a PC and I assumed 
that somewhere in the Miktex\doc directory there would be a "getting 
started" document.  But I couldn't find any such doecument.  I cannot find 
anything called local guide, for example.  Now I have been using tex since 
about 1985 and I know these things for a PC like the back of my hand, but 
I haven't any idea how you do things on a Mac and I don't know how to find 
it.  I do know this: if I were a new tex user on a Win machine, I could 
not get started from the documentation I could find on mine.

Assuming that files in the miktex directory describe MiKTeX, I doubt
that it's useful to point Mac users to them.

Point him to

  http://www.tug.org/mactex

instead.

This is not a question of how to help a Mac user. 
Michael Barr is complaining that MiKTeX does not provide 
"getting started" information.  So there is no point in 
pointing to http://www.tug.org/mactex, rather I would 
like to point Michael Barr to http://www.miktex.org, 
most briefly, or he might tell his story on the MiKTeX list, 
or some MiKTeX user reading texhax could comment on Michael's 
complaint about MiKTeX.  The Mac part of the story only 
explains how it came about that Michael found a reason to 
complain about MiKTeX's documentation.

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Miktex installs a documentation in the normal windows start menu. It
contains e.g. this page

http://docs.miktex.org/2.9/manual/localguide.html#gettingstarted

It is a question of how to help a first time Mac user as well, because:

The answer to Michael's original question, in addition to the mactex
site, would be to point the Mac user to

	Applications -> TeX -> READ ME FIRST.pdf

and

	Applications -> TeX -> What is installed.pdf

from the Finder.  Assuming of course that since the Mac user was lent a tex-live disk
s/he ended up installing texlive.
