Subject: [texhax] kerTeX: e-TeX, CWEB and packaging!
Message-ID: <20120101225625.GA7780@polynum.com>

The 0.9999.0.2 version of kerTeX has been released.

This version includes:
	
	- NEW! NTS team' e-TeX (e-TeX passes the 3 steps ETRIP test); for
	the ones unaware, amongst other things, e-TeX offers left-to-right
	and right-to-left...

	- NEW! Donald E. Knuth and Silvio Levy' CWEB programs (CWEBINPUTS
	accept the same syntax for path searching as the other kerTeX
	programs: colon separated alternatives);

	- NEW! A packaging system!

kerTeX passes the TRAP (METAFONT), TRIP (TeX), TWIST (New name for
MetaPost torture test) and ETRIP (NTS e-TeX) tests.

                         WHAT IS KERTEX?

KerTeX aims to be a portable, maintainable, small and robust TeX kernel
System, providing the basis upon which everything depends: D.E. Knuth's
digital typography programs.

It has maximum portability: C89 and that's all the binaries program. For
running, one program---MetaPost---depends on a handful Bourne shell
script. For the administration of the system, we use only a limited
subset of essential POSIX.2 tools (that can typically be found on
Plan9).

KerTex has to be thought as a guest system: it is hosted by an OS. Once 
kerTeX is "ported" to the OS, the ideal would be that TeXpkg are solely
the problem of kerTeX: one packages for kerTeX, and the host system has
nothing to worry about.

KerTeX is small (see LISEZ.MOI/README):

	- 10 Mb of sources to download.

	- The sources are taken read-only by the R.I.S.K framework. So one
	needs, at least... 16 Mb of writable space to compile and package
	(with R.I.S.K SAVE_SPACE=YES option, that removes all intermediary
	products---including the generated Makefiles...---once a target is
	obtained (make SAVE_SPACE=YES; make SAVE_SPACE=yes pkg).

	- The initial installation needs 16 Mb of free space.

	- After installation, kerTeX uses its own packaging system to
	compile the dumps (for METAFONT, TeX, e-TeX and MetaPost) and to
	generate the fonts and derived TFM. It is so for not running the
	compiler/interpreter as root. 

		This adds 9 Mb to the base system. So it needs apx. 25 Mb to
		install.


                 TeX THE AWARD WINNING SOFTWARE!


AWARDED! best software of 2012! [so far]


       READ WHAT OTHER CUSTOMERS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT kerTeX!


Mr Euclides [Alexandria]: "Whoa!... If only I had had it before, I
wouldn't have to copy my books by hand! And furthermore, I wouldn't have
to answer again, and again and again! the very same question: How were
your "other" books lost ? That's not my _books_ that were lost: that's
my time, trying to install another TeX distribution!"


                      EXTRACTS FROM THE FAQ

Q: We are professionals in the printing business, with professional
needs. Do you have a kerTeX-pro?

A: no: all our products are professional ones.

Q: We were planning to install a TeX distribution. So we have bought a
Top10 supercomputer; planned to hire 30 TeX wizards and were in
negociation to buy some Megawatts when heating is almost over, and
cooling not already there, in order to have cheaper prices. And now, you
announce this!!!! What shall I do?

A: Resp.: sell, fire and revoke. With your pocket money, go to the next
supermarket and buy a middle sized programmable toaster. It should have
memory enough to cross-compile kerTeX for your wrist-watch.

                         GET THE FACTS!

The scientific community has shamelessly hiden what is known as David
Hilbert's 24th problem---because it was deemed too hard. Here we restore
the facts. David Hilbert has spoken in this way:

"And last, because it is the most urgent; because it is the most
difficult and shall be done first! I'm going to speak about the
mathematical typographic problem!

"We hear: TeX-easy ignorabimus: we don't know how to install TeX easily,
and we will never know. I say: TeX-easy ignoramus: we don't know _yet_!

"But because typography must help the mind; must be by its clarity the
shortest path to the meaning (when there is one...); because a
mathematician has to be able to draw new signs if he sees fit; to
express the link between the notions by choosing the same letter, but at
the same time showing the differences by rendering them in different
shapes, a mathematician should never again [pause; lump in his
throat]... never again [closing his eyes and shivering] be forced to
use, because there was nothing else left, a gothic font! [loud cries;
guitars; mathematicians shouting their love and throwing their
underwears toward the platform].

"So I say: from the mathematical typographic heaven Donald E. Knuth's
has offered us! nobody should be allowed to banish us!"


                           CONCLUSION

In this moment when everybody will deliver "best wishes", I must
recognize that the "best" is not my realm: I'm human. All I know is an
effort towards a better. But a better _done_.

This effort has a name: kerTeX!

Subject: [texhax] \bigcupdot / \bigdotcup in LaTeX
Message-ID: <4F0166BE.3030806@gmx.de>

I've been wondering how to use the \bigdotcup symbol without the
MnSymbol package.

My current hack is not too beautiful, but it works at least in
\displaystyle:

% Uhhh....
\newcommand{\bigdotcup}{\ensuremath{\mathop{\makebox[-2pt]{\hspace{16pt}{\(\cdot\)}}\bigcup}}}

Problem: it absolutely does not work in \textstyle (the \cdot is
misaligned).
Is there some command to define it separately for \displaystyle and
\textstyle?  Or is there a hopefully better definition for the symbol?

Since some users may be uncorfomtable with the commands to launch the
compilation, I attach here a script that makes (minus the typo about
kertex-bundle.tar -> kertex_bundle_{en|fr}.tar) what is explained.

This is for a _default_ installation of course. Because everything is
configurable.

If there is positive feedback about the usefulness of the script, I will
simply put online and in the bundles.

[Note, the script cleans or removes nothing.]

  Thanks!  I found my mistake -- in conducting the experiments
  that varied the kern value from 0.1pc to 1pc to 10pc, I was
  changing the \kern value in the wrong macro and so wasn't 
  seeing any change in the location of the page number in 
  the output.

Subject: [texhax] Delimited arguments and ProvidesFile macro in hyphen.cfg
Message-ID: <201201030117.q031Heio095364@net.indra.com>

This is a basic TeX macro syntax question.  I think, anyway.

I've been trying to wrap my head around (some of) the innards of LaTeX, 
by tracing through little parts of its source code in "latex.ltx" to see 
what happens (by saying "tex -ini latex.ltx" while in the directory 
"./texmf-dist/tex/latex/base", after unpacking the ".ins" install file to 
create "latex.ltx").

Towards the end of LaTeX's compilation, it processes a file "hyphen.cfg", 
a copy of which I tweeked with tracing commands and placed in the same 
directory.  I know it's the file being processed, because the log file 
contains the traces of the code I tweeked.

The first thing that happens in that file is the macro \ProvidesFile is 
(re)defined as follows:

\def\ProvidesFile#1[#2 #3 #4]{\toks 8{Babel <#3> and hyphenation patterns 
for }\b
bl at tempa #1[#2 #3 #4]\let \ProvidesFile \bbl at tempa }

The definition doesn't matter; what I'm focused on is how it's collecting 
its 4 delimited arguments, a few lines later when the macro is invoked.

When I trace this macro's execution, the output TeX creates begins:

\ProvidesFile #1[#2 #3 #4]->\toks 8{Babel <#3> and hyphenation patterns 
for }\b
bl at tempa #1[#2 #3 #4]\let \ProvidesFile \bbl at tempa 
#1<-{hyphen.cfg} 
#2<-2008/07/06
#3<-v3.8l
#4<-Babel language switching mechanism
{\toks}
etc.

My question is, why does the argument token list for parameter #1 include 
the open and closed braces (followed by a space)?  I thought TeX stripped 
the outermost set of braces during argument collection.

The reason I'm confused is because if I trace the following simple test 
macro with parallel argument delimiter structure

{
	\def\tester#1[#2 #3 #4]{}
	\tracingcommands=3
	\tracingmacros=3
	\tester{sweet}[babel onion tears]%
}

during a normal run of TeX (using the LaTeX format), the log file contains

\tester #1[#2 #3 #4]->
#1<-sweet
#2<-babel
#3<-onion
#4<-tears

and the first argument has had its outermost braces stripped, as I 
expected.

How can both traces be correct?  I'm clearly missing something about 
delimited macro arguments, or about some secret thing LaTeX's code does, 
or both.

Thanks in advance for any illumination.

Hi Doug,

    This is a basic TeX macro syntax question.  I think, anyway.

I'm not sure "basic" is the right word :).

    My question is, why does the argument token list for parameter #1
    include the open and closed braces (followed by a space)?

I don't immediately see it either.  As far as I know, the outer braces
are stripped in all cases except when the argument text contains
mismatched braces, which is evidently not the case here.

Maybe I missed it, but did you include where and how the \ProvidesFile
is being called from your modified hyphen.cfg?
Maybe seeing the beginning of your hyphen.cfg would help.

And, perhaps try running latex directly on the standard and modified
hyphen.cfg, with tracing enabled, and see where they begin to differ.

It might also help to run etex instead tex, since there is more tracing
output.

It probably has the dot too low, but try:

You don't show that \makeheadline actually invokes \leftheadline
or \rightheadline, so that might be the problem.

Because of the space, hyphen.cfg installed on my system
contains:

  \ProvidesFile{hyphen.cfg}
                  [2008/07/08 v3.8m %

The first argument of the definition above is a delimited
argument, delimited by "[". In this case this is
"{hyphen.cfg}" and the line end that becomes a space: "{hyphen.cfg} ".
Now the braces are not a pair of outermost braces and are not
removed.

Compare with "\tester{sweet} [babel onion tears]".

  You are right:  I first copied manmac.tex's \leftheadline and
  \rightheadline into my document and then used the ideas in them to
  make a new macro that was actually used by \makeheadline;  but
  after making my macro, I did not delete the copies of
  \leftheadline and \rightheadline.  Then while experimenting with
  changing the \kern value, I made the changes in the unused copies
  rather than in the used new macro.

  By the way, thanks for the your post of Aug 10, 1998 which showed
  the modifications to the output macro.

 From Donald's and Heiko's insights, I would have expected
line four to read :

	"#1<-{hyphen.cfg} "

whereas in my copy as received, it reads :

	"#1<-{hyphen.cfg}"

Is it possible for you to check the original output and
see whether the trailing space of #1 is indeed reported
in the log file, as I would have expected ?

Message-ID: <1325584437.56141.YahooMailNeo@web120805.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

After recently installing texlive , I've noticed that \input{file} adds an extraneous space, for example, if f.tex contains
abc

then
\input{f}test

produces 
abc test

Here is a minimal example:
\documentclass[10pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\input{f}test
\end{document}

Would appreciate suggestions how to solve this.

True.  However, if "f.tex" contains solely "abc%" with no extra
characters, then this does not occur; thus there is an implicit
space in your version of "f.tex".  A more general solution would be
to \unskip following \input {}.

When TeX reads a file it adds \endlinechar at the end of each line.
Normally this gives a space. That's why

abc
cde

gives "abc cde" in a document and not "abccde". 

TeX is doing this for every line of your main document and your
input file -- including the last line of this file. 

You can suppress \endlinechar for all following lines by using
\endlinechar=-1. For the last line of your input file you can use
whatever you would use for the same purpose in single lines of your
main document: A "%", or a command which swallows the following
space like \relax or \endinput, or a command which swallows the
preceding space like \unskip.

The space is correct.
If TeX reads a line, it removes the end line marker and spaces
at the end of the line. Then it inserts the character, configured
by \endlinechar. Usually it's <CR> (0x13) with catcode end of line (5)
that then becomes a space.

Rationale. Without space the previous paragraph would read like
  The space is correct.If TeX ... and spacesat the end ... configuredby ...

> Would appreciate suggestions how to solve this.

If you don't want that space at the line end, one solution is
already shown. A comment char at the line end puts the
inserted end of line character in a comment:
  abc%
But that means, the contents of the file needs to be modified.
Another way is to set
  \endlinechar=-1
during the reading of the input file. Then the insertion of
the end of line chararacter is suppressed, e.g.:

\begingroup
  \endlinechar=-1 %
  \input{f}%
\endgroup
test

If the contents of the file should be put in a macro, then
package catchfile helps.

Hey,

For a cooperative latex document with a lot of authors, it was decided to use tables for certain structures. Therefore, I have to cope with the problem of automatic page breaks of tables that only consist of 1 column and several rows. The column often contain different lists. The attached example shows the problem: The table does not break within a list. Is there a way to work around this issue?

Thank you in advance

Subject: [texhax] listings options
Message-ID: <87wr98kfab.wl%neal@walfield.org>

Hi,

I'm using the listings package to typeset some code.  I have some
short snippets that I'm including inline and some longer examples that
I put in floats.  I want to apply different options to each of these.
For instance, I want the floating listings to have line numbers, but
the inline listings shouldn't.  Further, the inline listings should be
slightly indented, but the floating listings shouldn't be.

I thought I'd do the following:

  \usepackage{listings}
  \newcommand{\lstfloatsettings}{float, numbers=left}
  \newcommand{\lstinlinesettings}{xleftmargin=4ex, xrightmargin=4ex}
  \lstset{
    columns=fullflexible,
    % Don't use visible spaces in strings.
    showstringspaces=false,
    basicstyle=\small,
    captionpos=b,
    frame=single,
  }

But, that doesn't work:

  \begin{lstlisting}[\lstfloatsettings, label=lst:example]
  ...
  \end{lstlisting}

=> 

  ! Package keyval Error: float, numbers=left undefined.
  
  See the keyval package documentation for explanation.
  Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
   ...  

Any ideas or suggestions for a better approach?

Thanks,

Neal

because of the expansion you canno store listings keys in macros. Use 
listings styles instead, i.e.

\lstdefinestyle{mystyle}{
key-vals
}

and then use it via style=mystyle

A longtable row is a single box that cannot break accross pages.

A *manual* page break could be implemented in a straightforward way,
saving the counter value,

But actually you do not need any alignment, you are abusing longtable
for drawing lines around blocks. So you can get something similar
with the framed or mdframed package (ctan.org/pkg/framed,
ctan.org/pkg/mdframed), i.e., a framed block may break across pages.

I am aware of differences, such as (i) having a single horizontal line
instead of two between those blocks (essential??), (ii) having
a shorthand like \\ closing one block and opening another,
(iii) narrowing the content text so that the vertical lines delimit
the type area rather than being in the margins --

-- but actually p{\textwidth} is a mistake, you get "Overfull \hbox"
warnings, don't you?

Sorry, I cannot afford dealing with details right now.

Hope it helps though

part and chapter are different beasts in memoir, and has their own

The problem is that I want a default style but a bit smaller and
cannot find an appropriate style. I tried

\renewcommand{\chaptitlefont}{\normalfont\Large\bfseries}
\renewcommand{\chapnamefont}{\normalfont\Large\bfseries}
\renewcommand{\chapnumfont}{\normalfont\huge\bfseries}

and it works but then it coincides with the section size (all above
are \huge in default) and I cannot figure out how to make it a bit
larger than \Large but smaller than \huge (\LARGE = \Large in memoir)

So what about

??? \usepackage{fix-cm}
??? \renewcommand{\chap...font}{%
??????? \normalfont\fontsize{VISIZE}{VIBASELINESKIPpt}\bfseries}

or something with

??? \newcommand{\subchapsize}{\fontsize{VISIZE}{VIBASELINESKIPpt}}

When I realized that I can get much more money from
widow/daughter/lawyer of some former Nigerian strongman who wants my
small help in transferring USD $10 billion out of the country and
offers me 10% for help :D I decided to give my discovery to mankind
for free :D

Sufficient for my purposes

{\setsecheadstyle{\centering\LARGE\bfseries\slshape}

Dear All,

I have drying multicolumn package with footnote placement in the text area width (automatically adjust in the \textwidth area). That is possible in LaTeX or XeLaTeX? If yes, could you please provide me some sample. I have tried ledmac, footmisc, etc., but this is controlling in the footer align only. But, I need to automatically update in the textarea width.

Thanks in advance.

Maybe it's worthwhile to look for lower level commands.  pgf is just a
wrapper for the PostScript imaging model which PDF inherited.

Thus, I assume that that pgf must have representations of low-level
PostScript instructions like moveto, lineto, curveto, and so on.
It's based on them.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I do not quite understand (i) "footnote placement in the text area width",?
(ii) "controlling in the footer align", and (iii) "automatically update in the
textarea width". The only sense I can make of (i) would be getting
footnotes typeset in a single column of text area width on the page
below the columns, spanning all of them.

And actually I do not quite understand (iv) "drying multicolumn package".
First I thought you tried the *multicol* package already, but you may be
looking for a package allowing multiple columns with text-area-width-wide
footnotes. Anyway, according to what I read, multicol *is* a package that?
does this. It happens without any additional footnote package, just

??? \documentclass{article} %% or so
??? \usepackage{multicol}
??? %% more?
??? \begin{document}
??? %% title and such
??? \begin{multicols}{NUMBER}
??? TEXT.\footnote{FOOTNOTE TEXT.}
??? \end{multicols}
??? \end{document}

Maybe it stops working as soon as you add another footnote package,
I don't know, sorry ...

Hi Uwe,

Thanks for your response.

Actually i have need to place the footnotes in the each page 3rd column bottom alignment only (in the text area part).? I have tried in ftnpara package.? But, this is working in 2 column only. But my requirement is 3rd column bottom placement.

simple code is:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{multicol,ftnpara}
\begin{document}
\title{Title here}
\author{Author here\footnote{Author email id}}
\section{Introduction}
\begin{multicols}{3}
<some text here>
\end{multicols}

\end{document}

Text area width means need to place the footnote in the <some text here> layout.

Hope you can understand my requirement.

Thanks and Regards,
jack

I do not know of any ftnpara package and cannot find it on CTAN.
"ftnpara" however reminds of "ftnright" (from the tools bundle in the?
"required" distribution of LaTeX) that places all the footnotes of a page
in the right column when a document is typeset in 2-column mode.

So I guess from your words above that by analogy you want to have
all the footnotes of a page in the rightmost column of the three of them.

I have sometimes tried to know all the possibilities of typesetting
footnotes available from CTAN (and other notes), but I am not
aware of a package that typesets footnotes in the rightmost column
with the {multicols} environment.

This would mean that you want to have the footnotes in a rather small
part of the type area, a part whose width is less than one third of the
type area width. Your earlier posting and your subject line rather
indicate something opposite to this interpretation of what you have
posted today.

I consider "<some text here> layout" a quite counter-intuitive "meaning"
of "text area width". Most things from outside the multicols environment
will appear within the type area (and its "width") too, so it is a funny idea
to refer to multicols content by "type area". Maybe you are working for
an intelligence service and therefore need to "encrypt" your requirement?

Even footnotes appear within the type area, within "type area width",
regardless of any multicols environment.

However, I see the \footnote command within the \author line.
You should not expect that the author line has any effect without
\maketitle -- BTW. BUT! from your wordings I guess that you hope
that that \footnote command OUTSIDE the multicols environment
works as if it had been placed WITHIN <some text here>.
OK! This will remain a secret of the two of us, I won't tell anybody else,
you can trust me!

Now, I can conceive of tricks to make stuff from outside the multicols
environment behave as if it were issued from within the multicols
environment. But unless we can place even the footnotes from
\footnote commands WITHIN the multicols environment within the
third column only, such a trick won't help you.

Sorry -- this doesn't help

I do not quite understand (i) "footnote placement in the text area width",?
(ii) "controlling in the footer align", and (iii) "automatically update in the
textarea width". The only sense I can make of (i) would be getting
footnotes typeset in a single column of text area width on the page
below the columns, spanning all of them.

And actually I do not quite understand (iv) "drying multicolumn package".
First I thought you tried the *multicol* package already, but you may be
looking for a package allowing multiple columns with text-area-width-wide
footnotes. Anyway, according to what I read, multicol *is* a package that?
does this. It happens without any additional footnote package, just

??? \documentclass{article} %% or so
??? \usepackage{multicol}
??? %% more?
??? \begin{document}
??? %% title and such
??? \begin{multicols}{NUMBER}
??? TEXT.\footnote{FOOTNOTE TEXT.}
??? \end{multicols}
??? \end{document}

Maybe it stops working as soon as you add another footnote package,
I don't know, sorry ...

Subject: [texhax] listings' alignment function
Message-ID: <87obuajz8i.wl%neal@walfield.org>

Hi,

I like the listings package a lot, in particular, I like that I don't
need to use an ugly monospace font to have the code reasonably well
aligned.  I'd like to improve the alignment a bit.  Consider the
following C code:

  for (s = list;
       s;
       s = g_slist_next (s))
    ...

The three s's are supposed to be aligned.  Unfortunately, they are
not.  listings does not realize that an open parenthesis indicates
where the text on the following line should start.  It instead formats
the code as follows:

  for (s = list;
          s;
          s = g_slist_next (s))
    ...

It's acceptable, but not pretty.

Is there a way to do what I want?  Perhaps some function that I'm
overlooking that says, align here, e.g.:

  for (\alignhere{}s = list;
       s;
       s = g_slist_next (s))
    ...

Thanks,

Neal

Search for 'columns' in documentation and play with it.

P.S. I tried small example with listings but it default style distract
me. From 'listings' documentation: "If fancyvrb and listings provide
similar functionality, you should use fancyvrb's.".

Message-ID: <CAMV-+kvWTvEHpPjSgff14L8bcGHzRC1iGBRRampwVtcUk=ArNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello fellow TeXnicians:

   I've installed the Libertine-legacy package into a local directory
on my system ( /local/texmf in particular ).  I have ran both "texhash
/local/texmf", and the
"updmap --enable
Map=/local/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/libertine-legacy/libertine.map"
commands.  These seemed to do the proper job of creating a local
.texmf-config and .texmf-var in my home directory.  I've also ensured
that I've set the environment variable TEXINPUTS to
".//:/local/texmf//:" to include my local
installation of the Libertine-legacy package.  Unfortunately, it seems
that not all is well, as when I attempt to use it in a simple LaTeX
file by using the following lines:

<CODE>
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{libertine}
</CODE>

 **And then I try to compile it with either "latex" or "pdflatex", I
get the following:

Okay gang!

  So I RTFMP on "tex" and found out about the TFMFONTS environment
variable ( along with MFINPUTS, VFFONTS and PKFONTS variables) which
should be set as well.

In my case I had to do the following ( in tcsh:  setenv TFMFONTS
.//:/local/texmf//: )

Then my pdflatex compilation of my file just worked.

Lesson of the day:  RTFMP

Sounds wrong (or at least to complicated). You should add the root
"/local/texmf" of your local texmf tree to e.g. TEXMFHOME. See the
e.g. the answer of egreg here:

Please provide a minimal example

This aligned fine for me

\documentclass[a4paper]{memoir}
\usepackage{listings}
\begin{document}
\begin{lstlisting}
for (s = list;
      s;
      s = g_slist_next (s))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{document}

note in your example there are too many spaces in front of some of the 
line in order for them to align on the s's

I'm sorry, I should have included this from the outset.  The key
missing detail is that I'm using fullflexible columns.  The alignment
is correct for flexible columns.  Here's a minimal example that
demonstrates the problem:

\documentclass{book}

\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{
  columns=fullflexible,
  showstringspaces=false,
}

\begin{document}

\begin{lstlisting}
for (s = list;
     s;
     s = g_slist_next (s))
\end{lstlisting}

\end{document}

> note in your example there are too many spaces in front of some of the

I'm not sure what you mean here.  I checked my original email and all
of the s's are aligned in my example's input.


Thanks for your help.

Good day,
 
Is it possible to buy the Tex Collection *2010* instead of *2011* on DVD from you?
 
I'm on an Apple iMac G4 running Mac OS X 10.4.11 which means that MacTex 2011 will not work.
 
The download of MacTex 2010 is huge and I have no possibilities to archive such a download as I have no DVD burner.
 
Thanks very much for your help!
 
Best regards,

Mr. Fischer is correct.  I did *NOT* need to specify TEXINPUTS,
TFMFONTS, MFINPUTS, etc, etc.

All that was needed was to specify:

setenv  TEXMFHOME   .//:/local/texmf//:

Then pdflatex was able to open the font files properly.

An interesting point to make is that certain combinations of the
previously mentioned environment variables did in fact impact the
search path, but for whatever reason did not include the type1 fonts,
so I would get error messages of the form:

"Warning: pdflatex (file fxlri.pfb): cannot open Type 1 font file for reading"

I wish the tex manpage mentioned the TEXMFHOME variable (  although
I'm using an old LaTeX:  "LaTeX2e <2003/12/01>" )

Hello,

Thanks to the courageous who tested and reported, a bug fixes release of
kerTeX has been published today: 0.9999.0.4.

With get_mk_install.sh, and pkg_latex.sh, you could be "cutting edge"
mind you :-^

It should work on literally anything (provisions have been
made---including path separator dance---even for Windows, but I will
tackle the task after 1.0 since I have probably the more clues on what
has to be done...).

So how about trying it on your favourite system?

You should consider to update. It makes a lot things easier. E.g.
you could install the libertine package with the package manager
instead of doing everything manually.

Yes.  I'm pretty sure we still have a stack from past years.  (Robin, if
not, let me know, I have a spare.)

I believe the most efficient way would be for you to go to
http://tug.org/store/, fill in the form as if you were ordering the 2011
DVD, and then write in the comments field (on the next page) that you
want the 2010 DVD.  A human (Robin, in the office) reads that before
doing anything with the order.

Subject: [texhax] problem with MathTime Pro 2 fonts and MikTeX
Message-ID: <op.v7222cqswhlurl@jesse-hp.grandenetworks.net>

I'm trying to install MathTime Pro 2 fonts to use with MikTeX 2.9 (using  
WinEDT 6 under Windows 7).  I used the instructions at  
http://www.pctex.com/kb/56.html, but this didn't work.  I tried to typeset  
this with Plain TeX:

\input mtp2

text.

\bye


but got an error.  The log file's empty, but I copied/pasted the text that  
shows up at the bottom of the screen in WinEDT at the bottom of this  
message.  Has anybody had the same problem, or can anyone make sense of  
the errors?  I checked, and the tfm files are in my root directory.  I  
also checked another installation of MikTeX on a Windows XP computer, and  
everything works fine there even though there's no file named "mt2m.cfg"  
there, either.

Thanks,


Stan

Subject: [texhax] Book Design
Message-ID: <201201141803.04676.ghaverla@materialisations.com>

There is common advice about how a person should not loan money 
to.  My guess is that in that same advice book, it says don't be 
the editor and publisher for a book your Mom wrote.

I'm 51, and Mom is 79.  I've been playing TeX games since probably 
the mid 80's.

I've started a few books, one in DocBook, the rest in LaTeX, none 
ever got finished.  Darned todo list keeps getting in the way.

Mom has done well at Toastmasters (finishing in second place, 
twice, to a young lawyer at provincial level competitions, and 
many people thinking she should have won), and a big chunk of this 
is speeches that she has given.  As such, I pretty much have to 
leave the grammar as is, even if it is bad.  Mom only went to 
school for 5 years, starting grade 1 at age 10, and finishing 
grade 9 at age 15.

The Memoir class looks interesting.  LyX is annoying me, and I 
will probably suck everything into emacs and convert it to memoir.  
Are there examples anywhere of chapter design with memoir?

These stories run over 8 decades.  I think the timeframe of the 
story and the year of the speech either need to be in each chapter 
heading, or perhaps in margin notes?  I've seen books (or 
newspapers) where the ink is missing in places for some letters, 
with so much broken English, I think a typeface that was "broken" 
might be interesting.  As far as dead tree goes, I am guessing 
that it probably needs to be printed in 12 point, as many of the 
people wanting copies of this are older and would appreciate a 
bigger typeface.

I suppose a person is going to be generating some kind of ebook 
output at some point as well as dead tree.

Ideas?  Suggestions?

Is there a way to obtain a plain text version of the final document processed by latex?. By final version I mean, where all macros, labels, and bibliography entries have been processed and assigned their "final" values. Of course, such a plain text version won't contain any floats.

Does 

   pdftotext -layout <your PDF file>

do what you need?

pdftotext is part of xpdf.  If you don't have it, just install xpdf.

TeX Live provides xpdf (and thus pdftotext) for Windows.  For other
systems I recommend to consult the dedicated package manager.  xpdf is
ubiquitous.

 > Of course, such a plain text version won't contain any floats.

It depends.  It's a matter of fact that a JPEG can't be represented as
plain text, but if the float is a table, it will appear in the output.

Furthermore I assume that pdftotext provides best output if you're in
an environment which supports UTF-8.

  Reinhard

  As per this page on ctan.org, Tex Live does _not_ provide xpdf
  (and neither does MikTex):  http://www.ctan.org/pkg/xpdf 
  I googled and got it from www.foolabs.com -- and was very happy
  to find that words in the pdf file with ligatures, like "first"
  with the "fi" ligature, were properly converted to "first" in
  the text file (which is unlike what Adobe's "save as text file"
  feature is capable of doing).

Yes, you are correct.  xpdf itself, as its name implies, depends on
the X11 window system, which unfortunately isn't supported by Windows.

However, what TeX Live provides are the wonderful command-line tools
which are part of the xpdf distribution, such as pdftotext, pdftops,
pdfimages, ...

  Reinhard

I found those pages too.  Reinstalling as suggested in the first page  
didn't fix the error I'm getting.  (Mine's similar but not identical to  
the one on the sourceforge page.)

>
> P.S. Did you try MT Pro 2 with LaTeX?

Yes, with no luck.

I might have found the problem, but I still don't know how to solve it.  I  
decided to open "updmap.cfg" in a text editor, and saw that it doesn't  
have the lines from step 5 in http://www.pctex.com/kb/56.html.  I searched  
for other files with the same name, and found one in my "roaming" folder  
under "appdata".  It was created when I did step 4.  It contains only the  
following lines:

%% T1 font configuration settings. See the MiKTeX manual for help.
# MathTimePro II
Map mtpro2.map

It doesn't seem to matter what directory I'm in when I run the initexmf  
line and the updmap line in steps 4 and 7.  It's not modifying the right  
copy of updmap.cfg.  (Or what I think it the right copy, the one under  
C:\Program Files (x86)\MikTeX\....)  I can't modify that file directly in  
a text editor, since I don't have permission to save to its location.   
Making a copy of it in My Documents, modifying it in a text editor, and  
then replacing the original with that copy didn't work.  Do you know if  
that's the copy that needs to be changed?  I couldn't find anything in the  
MikTeX manual about it.

Thanks,


Stan

"It" being "pdftotext", not Xpdf itself, of course ...

Probably because you've used a font with the "Th" ligature and it isn't
recognized. Indeed, with a document in CM, "Th" renders to "Th", while
the same documents in Chaparral renders "Th" as some impossible glyph.

It also renders "ff" as a ligature, unless you include (in the TeX
document with pdfTeX or LuaTeX):

  \pdfgentounicode=1
  \pdfglyphtounicode{ff}{0066 0066}

in which case it properly analyzes the ligature.

So something along those lines should be tried with "Th", provided you
find the glyph's name (not "Th" in Chaparal):

  \pdfglyphtounicode{<name>}{0054 0068}

Hopefully it works. But still that must be done before compilation, or
perhaps pdftotext as some option signalling such glyph must be mapped to
such character(s)?

Best,
Paul

On the main Linux computer of our Dept

/usr/bin/pdftotext
pdftotext version 3.00
Copyright 1996-2004 Glyph & Cog, LLC

as it came from RHEL and there is no other pdftotext at all despite
having TL2010 and 2011

On my Macs it is
/usr/local/bin/pdftotext
pdftotext version 0.17.2
Copyright 2005-2011 The Poppler Developers - http://poppler.freedesktop.org
Copyright 1996-2004 Glyph & Cog, LLC

as I installed by myself compiling poppler.

I am not sure that CML utilities of xpdf are part of TL. On the other
hand while compiling xpdf could be tricky, these utilities come out
easily
pdffonts
pdfimages
pdfinfo
pdftoabw
pdftohtml
pdftoppm
pdftops
pdftotext

Get the version with poppler (http://poppler.freedesktop.org) - it's
highly improved.

W/o minimal example (LaTeX one would be perfect) and its log generated
by pdf[la]tex it is difficult to find the source of the problem.

I don't have Windows machine and MiKTeX right now at hand to check but
"roaming" directory seems ok.

Try to run
C:\> initexmf --mkmaps
C:\> updmap

The first command should merge all updmap.cfg files into one, the second
command should generate file that pdflatex of dvips uses to produce pdf
or ps file.

Below is example document with many mathematical formulae and include external graphics:
<example file="ex1.ltx">
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{article}

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[spanish]{babel}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage[intlimits]{amsmath}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{a4paper,text={6.75in,8.5in},topmargin=0in}

\begin{document}
% Texto
\end{document}
</example>

General advice #1: start with simple preamble (like in the example) and
add packages only when know what they provide.

General advice #2: READ [PACKAGE] DOCUMENTATION, e.g. if you use TeX
Live distribution run in terminal (command prompt):
texdoc geometry
or
texdoc [package name]
to read package documentation.

The example from my original email is the smallest I used, but it doesn't  
even get far enough to put anything in the log file.  A log file is  
created, but it's empty.

No luck.  Could there be some necessary step that the instructions take  
for granted?  I've been refreshing the File Name Database, for example,  
each time I try this, which is not stated anywhere in the steps.  (I'm not  
actually sure that's required after doing it once after moving the mtp2  
files into my local directory, but I've been doing it each time just in  
case.)  I wonder whether omitting something like that is stopping the  
"real" copy of updmap.cfg from being modified.


Thanks,

Stan

I've tried using pdftotext to obtain a plain text file, but I'm getting the following error:
Error: Illegal entry in bfrange block in ToUnicode CMap

pdftotext is whatever is installed on my debian linux machine.

Is this font related? or something else?.

I should asked you eariler: what TeX distribution do you use? MiKTeX?
TeX Live?

Could you LIST the content of the archive with MT Pro 2? For example, if
'mtpro2.zip' is archive with MT Pro 2 files unzip them and run in
command line
C:\Temp\mtpro2> dir

Where do you unpack the archive, does your TeX distribution knows where
to search for that files? Run
C:\> kpsewhich [sty file from archive]
according to some PDFs this is 'mtpro2.sty', kpsewhich command provided
by both MiKTeX and TeX Live.

Minimal LaTeX example:

<example file="ex.ltx">
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{mtpro2}

\begin{document}
This is example.

The great formula $\exp^{\imath x}=\cos{x}+\imath\sin{x}$.

\end{document}
</example>

Run:
C:\Temp\test>latex -interaction=nonstopmode ex.ltx

P.S. I suspect that this LaTeX file could fail with 'File .. not found' or
similar message. This would mean that tex don't find needed file and MT
Pro 2 is installed incorrectly.

I'm using MikTeX 2.9.

I found "dir /s /b > print.txt" online as a way to print the file names to  
a file.  (attached)

I ran this, and the line

    C:/TeX/tex/texmf/tex/latex/mtpro2/mtpro2.sty

appeared.  That's probably good?

I ran your example, and got a log file (attached).  The stuff that  
appeared in the terminal window while it was running looks like what  
appeared in the window at the bottom of WinEDT when I ran my original  
Plain TeX file.  One of the lines in the terminal output was "Couldn't  
find `mt2e.cfg'".  I searched myself for that file in my local folder and  
the MikTeX folder, and the local and roaming appdata folders, and didn't  
find it.  Is this something that's supposed to be created when running  
updmap?


Thanks,


Stan

To be a little bit more verbose than Vladimir:  If you run

  latex foo.tex

you get a file called "foo.log" in the current working directory.
This is the file we need.  You can also inspect it yourself.  Maybe
you find something suspicious.  If not, don't hesitate to send us the
file.

  Reinhard

Yes, this means that latex finds the file.

I looked into it.
Now strange thing: latex finds style file but it can't
find font files (TFM). According to 'print.txt' they in distribution,
could you check the following:
1. make sure that you copied distribution files in proper place;
 the above 'kpsewhich' command shows that 'mtpro2.sty' file in
 'C:/TeX/tex/texmf/tex/latex/mtpro2'
 Is 'C:/TeX/tex/texmf' (exactly this directory!) in MiKTeX search path
 (listed under tab 'Roots' in settings app)?
2. make sure that there are TFM files in 'C:/TeX/tex/texmf/fonts/tfm/pctex/mtpro2'

In any case try the following:
1. Remove 'C:/TeX...' directory from 'Roots' (if it doesn't contain
other essential TeX/LaTeX files), remove only from the LIST!, not from
DISK!
2. 
 a) Extract distribution archive to C:\Temp\mtp2 as you do eariler.
 b) Add directory 'C:\Temp\mtp2\texmf' to the list of 'Roots'.
 c) Refresh file name database (FNDB),
 d) add 'map' file to 'updmap.cfg': run
  initexmf --edit-config-file updmap
  and add line 'Map mtpro2.map' to it,
 e) run 
  initexmf --mkmaps
3. Run latex on example file. Now it should find TFM files (font files).

If this would work then you improperly installed MT Pro 2 (I suspect that
latex from MiKTeX finds sty file even in wrong place but font
files must be in proper place).

Hi,

If you realy want help on your LaTeX file you should, of course, know
something about LaTeX (I have felling that you don't see latex file for
many years).

To get help you should 1) inform others about you progress (did you
change your '\psfig' commands, convert figures, try to isolate problem
with math) and show you log again (after modification).

I've got "C:\TeX" listed there.  I'm assuming that's okay since that  
should include all the directories under it.

They're there.

It worked, but not entirely as I thought it would.  I attached the TeX  
file, and the log and pdf.  The \exp, \cos, and \sin are all in Computer  
Modern, but the x and dotless i are in mtp2.  I haven't set up mtp2 in a  
while - obviously - but I don't remember any special commands needed for  
making stuff like \sin typeset in mtp2.  Does the log file indicate why  
that's happening?



Thanks,

Stan

You should have therefore showed how you attempted to use \underset, because
it does work in the obvious way.

As I said, a LaTeX engine will find sty file even if its location is wrong
(somewhere under 'C:\TeX' if the path is listed under 'Roots'). This is not a
bug, it is a feature. Font files are another beasts, dvips or font part
of pdflatex engine will search them only in specific directories.

and as I said that means you have improperly installed MT Pro 2 distribution.
Now you have to install them correctly but afraid it could be painful.

If you wish to continue you have to be careful.

1. As you have installed MT Pro 2 manually you have to manually remove it.
Accoring to print.txt (archive listing) there are two directories in distribution:
  templates/
and
  texmf/
and file 'EULA*.txt'.

AFAIU, you extract content of the archive into
  C:/TeX/tex
so there are
  C:/TeX/tex/templates
and
  C:/TeX/tex/texmf
directories.

If before installation there were no such directories under 'C:/TeX/tex' simply
remove them.

2. Extract context of the archive into some temporary place, for example
in
  C:/Temp/mtp2
Then copy all directories under
  C:/Temp/mtp2/texmf
directly into[1]
  C:/TeX
For example, file 'mtpro2.sty' (package 'mtpro2') must have the following path:
  C:/TeX/tex/latex/mtpro2/mtpro2.sty
and TFM fonts must be in directory
  C:/TeX/fonts/tfm/pctex/mtpro2/

[1] May be you already notice that 'C:/TeX' has special structure, there
are directories 'doc', 'fonts', 'tex' and etc. If not, take a look into
directory in which MiKTeX was installed (usually 'C:/Program Files/MiKTeX')
to get idea.

Now do steps c), d) and e).

The only left directory is 'templates'. You can copy it to
  C:/TeX/doc/latex/mtpro2
(you have to create this directory of course).

Do you see 'testMTP2LaTeX.pdf' file from distribution? It is in
'texmf/doc/fonts/mtpro2'. I think you find answer on your issue.

This worked perfectly as far as I can see.

This was just a careless mistake of mine.  (Why did I think that \rm would
redefine itself?)


Thanks greatly for all the help,

Subject: [texhax] Space before remark or theorem
Message-ID: <000001ccda93$c5ca9f20$515fdd60$@mathshelp.com>

Dear Tug technical help

/

I have the following code inserted in my MikTeX 2.9 setup before I call
remark.

For some reason, the "measure of space to leave above and below" do not have
any effect; whereas the others do.

/

\newtheoremstyle{remark}% name of the style to be used

  {3pt}% measure of space to leave above the theorem. E.g.: 3pt

  {4pt}% measure of space to leave below the theorem. E.g.: 3pt

  {}% name of font to use in the body of the theorem

  {0pt}% measure of space to indent

  {}% name of head font

  {;}% punctuation between head and body

  {12pt}% space after theorem head; " " = normal interword space

  {}% Manually specify head

/

Can anyone suggest why, please?

What can override these instructions?

/

Is there a reason you can't go directly to .pdf from Word using one of the free conversion programs?

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/

should make this conversion trivial.

If you really need for the document to be a .tex file first you'll need to:

 - perform the conversion --- the free rtf2latex may work for you: http://sourceforge.net/projects/rtf2latex2e/ (save the file as a .rtf out of Word) --- if not, try the commercial word2tex: http://word2tex.com/

 - install a LaTeX installation if you don't have one already --- https://www.tug.org/begin.html (an alternative way to do this would be to install LyX, which you may find of use: http://www.lyx.org

 - then you'll need to open up the .tex file in an editor or integrated shell such as TeXworks:
https://www.tug.org/texworks/
and ``typeset'' the document using pdflatex to get a .pdf

Please let us know if you need further assistance or information.

It's also not a good idea to specify a width and a height at the same
time.  This has an impact on the aspect ratio of the graphic.  It's
better to specify the width only, relative to \textwidth:

 \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{...}

Alternatively specify both, and add keepaspectratio to the list of options.
This uses the maximum size filling the given width x height space which
does *not* change aspect ratio:
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth,0.8\textheight,keepaspectratio]{...}

Hope that helps,

Friends,

I've received word that the Graduate School at Michigan State  
University will begin requiring that every entry in the LOF must be  
the ENTIRE caption of the figure, including the word, "Figure". Since  
the construction of the LOF seems to be hardwired into the LaTeX  
kernel, I don't see how I will be able to do this. Any ideas?

Thanks,


Cliff

I don't speak a word of LaTeX, but package "TOCLOFT"
springs to mind as a possible candidate solution.

Another idea, just spurting it out without any looking up of details (which
would be rather futile without knowing more about the class and packages
you are using):

There are language specific definitions of the text used instead of
'Figure' (perhaps you need babel for that). You might use the appropriate
command to redefine that to the empty string (\renewcommand{\figurename}{},
though I do not not know if \figurename is the correct command; that
depends on the class and packages you are loading).

Then you would have to redefine how figure numbers are shown. You would
have to look up how it's difined now, then add the word Figure. Something
like \renewcommand{\thefigure}{Figure \thesection.\arabic{figure}}.

Possibly you would have to prepend some commands to this macro definition
to make up for the introduced white space (as a result of the empty figure
name). I do not know how flexibly this figure name stuff is coded.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

In the memoir class this is as easy as

\rewnewcommand\cftfigurename{\figurename~}

If I'm not mistaken tocloft offers the same solution (perhaps with a 
different name)
