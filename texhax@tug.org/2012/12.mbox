Subject: [texhax] TeX query 5:  \hsize and \settabs
Message-ID: <50bb0801.820eb40a.29a5.ffffabd9@mx.google.com>

Hi folks,
I've been playing with the `\settabs' macro and have made the 
following observations (with a little help from a sighted friend):

* All columns are left-aligned by default.

* The `\settabs' structure ( `{\hsize ... \settabs ... }' ) is 
left-aligned on the page by default.

* The `\hsize' value determines the length of the gap between the 
left-most edge of the left column and the left-most edge of the right 
column for each pair of columns.. So, the `\hsize' value in a table 
with 4 columns will apply to columns one and two, two and three, and 
three and four. The gaps between the points in all pairings is the same length.

* A `0' value assigned to `\hsize' will left align all columns and 
place them on top of each other over the left-most column in the table.

* A positive value of `\hsize' will measure the two points in the 
column pairings in the order the columns appear in the source.

* A negative value of `\hsize' will produce a mirror of the output 
produced by its positive inverse.

Other than that, please feel free to point out any errors or fill in 
the gaps in above notes.

Many thanks,
Paul

Hi folks,

It seems that the first argument/value passed to zsettabs doesn't 
make much difference to the output. For example with `zsettabs 2 
zcolumns', it is still possible to typeset three columns in the 
"table" and the TeX compiler makes no plaintiff noises.  Here's an example:

%start code
{\hsize = 5cm \settabs 2 \columns
\+column 1&column 2&column 3\cr
\+one&cattle&herd\cr
\+two&fish&school\cr
\+three&lions&pride\cr}

\bye
%end code

produces the same output as:

%start code
{\hsize = 5cm \settabs 3 \columns
\+column 1&column 2&column 3\cr
\+one&cattle&herd\cr
\+two&fish&school\cr
\+three&lions&pride\cr}

\bye
%end code

Any idea what's going on?

Many thanks,
Paul

Message-ID: <8738zo38c4.wl%neal@walfield.org>

Hi,

The document that I'm working on now takes about a minute to typeset.
I want to improve this by only compiling a subset of the chapters.  I
know about breaking the document into multiple files and using
\includeonly to only select a subset of the chapters, but I like
having a single file.  I thought that I could get the same effect
using the filecontents package.  I've written some macros that appear
to do what I want, but the file inclusion results in an "infinite"
loop.  Here's the output of the attached example:

  LaTeX Warning: Overwriting file `./b-segment-1.tex'.
  
  
  LaTeX Warning: Overwriting file `./b-segment-2.tex'.
  
  (./b-segment-2.tex
  
  ! LaTeX Error: \include cannot be nested.

   ...

I think that the problem has something to do with the interaction of
\filecontents and \include.  If I replace the \include with just some
text, it seems to work fine.

Thanks for any help!

It seems to me that you are confusing \include with \input, 
trying to issue \include conditionally. Instead, you still must issue 
\include for /each/ "segment" (chapter). What to "actually include" 
is controlled by \includeonly. So your "segment" macro only should 
determine the file name. Separately from that, you must transform 
\segmentsToInclude into the proper input for the \includeonly macro, 
which must happen in the document preamble already.

It appears to me that the main difficulty with your idea is 
that you want to refer to the "segments" by something different 
from their file names, I cannot help you with that tonight ...

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

The reason that I use \include is that I want to use the .aux files of
the not included files.  So, you are right: I need to unconditionally
use \include and use \includeonly to control what gets included.

Unfortunately, \includeonly needs to be issued before the files are
\included.  Right now, I only know the names when the segments are
encountered.  I need to rethink my approach.  Perhaps I should just
steal the .aux inclusion machinery.

FWIW, replacing the use of \include with \inputdoesn't help.  I still
get an infinite recursion.


Thanks for your help!

Message-ID: <62e99d8c2c7e66f341037d09fe365614.squirrel@alu.dc.ufc.br>

Dear mates,

I would like to define macros that in their turns define other macros, in the
spirit of the following erroneous TeX code:

---------------------
\def\macromaker#1{%
  \def\submacro#1{I am submacro #1}%
  \def\anothersubmacro#1{I am another submacro #1}}

\macromaker{test}
\submacrotest
\anothersubmacrotest
---------------------

With the code above I expected to define macros "\submacrotest", which would
print "I am submacro test", and "\anothersubmacrotest", printing "I am another
submacro test", but apparently none gets even defined.

Could someone please explain "what's going on" here? My background: I've been
using LaTeX for years, I am a computer scientist and C/C++ programmer, and
read parts of the TeXbook, but have not found the opportunity to master it to
the level where I could do the TeX programming that I have always wanted to
do.

One last thing, so that I can understand it better: what if I wanted
"\submacrotest" to have two parameters and to print them, say, "I am submacro
test and received #1 and #2"?

Thanks in advance, --Pablo.

I do this all the time, and control it by whether there is a filename to 
be input.  If I don't want the input, I test for EOF and then close the 
input register.  If I do want it I close the input register and then 
reopen it.  Works every time, but, of course, it isn't LaTeX.  All that 
is needed is to include or exclude the input file from the source 
directory you are using.

\openin\announceread=rh-Sheridan
\ifeof\announceread
\closein\announceread
\GTskip{2}  % Skip the Sheridan lines and leave a space
\else
\closein\announceread
\input rh-Sheridan  % Read the input lines from rh-Sheridan.tex
\fi

  Note that \closein has to be used in each branch so that the read, if 
wanted, will start at the beginning of the file.  Is this allowed in 
LaTeX? I don't know, but it ought to be.

Short answer : you cannot achieve what you are trying
to achieve without using \csname ... \endcsname.  This
is the nearest you will get without those :

\def \macromaker#1%
     {%
         \def \submacro #1{I am submacro#1}%
         \def \anothersubmacro #1{I am another submacro#1}%
     }

\macromaker {test}
\submacro test
\anothersubmacro test
\end

Fuller answer (maybe) when I am less busy.

The number of declared columns doesn't prevent you from using more, it
just sets the size of each column; in your previous message (TeX Query 5), 
you said 

> The `\hsize' value determines the length of the gap between the 
> left-most edge of the left column and the left-most edge of the right 
> column for each pair of columns.

but actually \hsize sets the width of the entire line (as usual); then

    \settabs 2 \columns

creates columns with a width of half the width of a line, while

    \settabs 5 \columns

creates columns whose width is a fifth of a line, and so on. Again,
that doesn't prevent you from using as many columns as you wish, it
simply sets their widths.

(I have nothing else to say on your previous message, TeX Query 5, which
is why I didn't reply to it; but I'm no \settabs wizard.)

Best,
Paul

This should do what you want:

  \def \macromaker#1%
       {%
           \expandafter \def \csname submacro#1\endcsname{I am submacro#1}%
           \expandafter \def \csname anothersubmacro#1\endcsname{I am another submacro#1}%
       }                                                                          
  
  \macromaker {test}
  \submacrotest
  \anothersubmacrotest
  \end

> Could someone please explain "what's going on" here?

When TeX is expanding \macromaker, it doesn't paste the control
sequence and #1 together.  As I understand it, when the definition of
\macromaker is processed, the control sequences are already recognized
as control sequences.  Instead, TeX recognizes #1 as an argument
delimiter.  So, to invoke your macro, you'd do:

  \submacro test

instead of

  \submacrotest

You need to double the number of hashes to avoid expansion of the
arguments.

  \def \macromaker#1%
       {%
           \expandafter\def \csname submacro#1\endcsname##1##2{I am submacro#1; '##1'; '##2'}%
       }
  
  \submacrotest{a}{b}

Inside the replacement text of \macromaker, you must double 
`#'s for "submacros": \def\submacro##1{I am submacro##1}. 
See Chapter 20 of The TeXbook.

Another mistake seems to be that your \macromaker just 
gobbles its own parameter, I believe that it does not 
make sense for \macromaker to have a parameter.

Other \macromaker's may well have parameters, to collect 
what is going to be defined and how, perhaps conditionally 
only, LaTeX's \newcommand is of this kind.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Dear Philip, Neal and Uwe, thanks a lot!

The doubling of the hashes was easy to understand. I also did a quick reading
about "\csname" in the web and in principle understood how to use it. Later I
will try to use these techniques and see whether I succeed. In any case, now I
have a clear indication of what to study.

Uwe: I really wanted the argument of \macromaker to be used in the names of
its "submacros". The need for this was perhaps not clear from that
artificially built example, but I do want to use it in my real context.

Thanks again, --Pablo.

doubling hashes is actually wrong for what you have in mind, 
when the outer parameter should be used in the inner definition(s). 
Neal's idea is a better interpretation of your mail, I did not 
properly try to make sense of "this is a submacro" and "this is 
another submacro" (I may be trying again below).

The \csname thing actually is used with "LaTeX objects" such as 
environments, counters, or references having an "identifier" like 
your outer parameter where "properties" of such an object are coded 
by "submacros" perhaps in your sense, each property with its own 
"namespace" encoding it. Heiko Oberdiek has used this "view" and 
terminology in his `zref' package. His `aliascnt' is a package that 
"copies" objects under different identifiers, where the "class" of 
"objects" just is that of "LaTeX counters". 

For one class of objects with three properties, you could define 
an object #1 by a macro \setobject as follows:

\newcommand{\setobject}[4]{%}


Cheers,

    Uwe.

Dear Pablo, dear all,

please ignore the previous posting, my Ubuntu Mail program seems to 
interpret a certain key combination as "send" while I don't want that. 
(Continuing at \newcommand ...)

\newcommand{\setobject}[4]{%
    \def\objectId{#1}%
    \@namedef  {propI|#1}{#2}%
    \@namedef {propII|#1}{#3}%
    \@namedef{propIII|#1}{#4}}

This way you could use \objectId to refer to the object's identifier 
in the second, third, and fourth argument of \setobject, such as 

\setobject{first}
          {First property of object `\objectId'}
          {Second property of object `\objectId'}
          {Third property of object `\objectId'}

Then with

\newcommand{\useobjectproperty}[2]{\csname #1|#2\endcsname}

you could call the single properties. There are smarter ways, 
such as a definedness check producing an error as with 
LaTeX's "environment" and "counter" classes.

[Not tested.]

Cheers,

    Uwe.

P.S.: the key combination for "send" is "Ctrl-Enter", which has a 
different meaning in my favourite text editor.

Sorry, this was very wrong with respect to \objectId.

\newcommand{\setobject}[4]{%    
    \@namedef  {propI|#1}{#2}%
    \@namedef {propII|#1}{#3}%
    \@namedef{propIII|#1}{#4}}

would be okay without the \objectId feature, which would mean 
something like that properties do not know whose properties 
they are.

So long ...

    Uwe.

... thinking of the original idea that the "submacro" actually 
reports whose submacro (property) it is. I find four possibilities 
for such an \objectId feature:

(i)

    \newcommand{\setobject}[4]{%
        \def\objectId{#1}%
        \@nameEdef  {propI|#1}{#2}%
        \@nameEdef {propII|#1}{#3}%
        \@nameEdef{propIII|#1}{#4}}
 
with 

    \newcommand{\@nameEdef}[1]{%
        \expandafter\protected at edef\csname#1\endcsname}

Then you can use \objectId and \protect in \setobject, 
and \protect may be essential in certain cases.

(ii)

    \newcommand{\setobject}[4]{% 
        \@nameOdef  {propI|#1}{#2}%
        \@nameOdef {propII|#1}{#3}%
        \@nameOdef{propIII|#1}{#4}}

    \newcommand{\@nameOdef}[1]{%

This works without \protect, but is not robust.

(iii) and (iv) that I have in mind use a macro parameter 
instead of \objectId.

(iii)

    \newcommand{\setAobject}[4]{%    
        \@namedef  {propI|#1}{#2{#1}}%
        \@namedef {propII|#1}{#3{#1}}%
        \@namedef{propIII|#1}{#4{#1}}}

This way \useobjectproperty{O}{propI} "finally prints" {O} 
unless you choose #2 so that it gobbles the argument ahead, 
e.g., #2 may end on \@gobble.

I am not sure what I should tell about my previous idea of (iv). 
It has been some elaboration of (iii), providing macros that 
either gobble {#1} in (iii) indeed or combine it with other 
information about the property, and I have thought of more than 
one way to do this ...

(iii) and (iv) are somewhat more powerful than the following 
simple way:

(v)

    \newcommand{\setobject}[4]{%    
        \@namedef  {propI|#1}{#2}%
        \@namedef {propII|#1}{#3}%
        \@namedef{propIII|#1}{#4}}

... my first way to correct my first mistake. Then to get a 
"report about the object", you can define a general way such 
as

    \newcommand{\reportobjectproperty}[2]{%
        Property `#2' of object `#1' is 
        \useobjectproperty{#1}{#2}.}

Then the report \reportobjectproperty{O}{P} is different from 
the property itself, while, e.g., with 

(vi)

    \newcommand{\setSobject}[4]{%    
        \@nameSdef  {propI}{#1}%
        \@nameSdef {propII}{#1}%
        \@nameSdef{propIII}{#1}}

and 

    \newcommand{\@nameSdef}[2]{%
        \@namedef{#1|#2}{%
             Property `#2' of object `#1' is me.}}

the report about object and property is part of the property.
However, would that be useful?

We can render the self-reference `me' in (vi) more formal 
when we replace `me' by \useobjectproperty{#1}{#2}, 
but I expect that the result is not much different from the 
result of 

    \newcommand{\run}{\run}

I tend to conclude that the original idea

    \def\macromaker#1{%
        \def\submacro#1{I am submacro #1}%
        \def\anothersubmacro#1{I am another submacro #1}}

leads into a bad direction (in just reporting and repeating #1) ...

Cheers,

Subject: [texhax] OTFtoTFM font installation
Message-ID: <20121206103026.DEB17E480A4@mail.premediaglobal.com>

Hi Team,

 

I have converted ITC Stone Serif OTF font to afm, tfm, vf and pfb files. I
have updated the map files (ps2pk35.map, dvips35.map, dvipdfm35.map,
pdftex35.map and psnfss.map). 

 

I have also created the t1pst.fd file. But when I put all the font files
(ex: .afm, .tfm, .vf and .pfb) and the t1pst.fd files inside the working
folder, I got all the fonts without any problem.

 

I want to access those fonts and map files from a default folder so that I
can use them from anywhere. I am using MikTeX 2.9 version and am developing
the fonts for the first time. Please guide me step by step and also tell me
the folder structure. I have no localtexmf folder in my current settings. 

 

It will be a great help if I could get the reply at the earliest.

 

Thanks in advance

SDAS

Subject: [texhax] TeX Query 7: measuring the real height and width
Message-ID: <50c40534.8618b40a.56ba.4ce9@mx.google.com>

Hi folks,
How does one draw a `virtical' line to a specified length in order to 
measure the height of box or boxes in the output?

For example, a virtical line to get an idea of the `real' height of 
the following structure:
%start code
{\hsize = 5cm \settabs 3 \columns
\+column 1&column 2&column 3\cr
\+one&cattle&herd\cr
\+two&fish&school\cr
\+three&lions&pride\cr}
%end code

There may be other ways of getting the real height and width of boxes 
and compound structures, if so, i'd be grateful for more info.

many thanks,
Paul

Paul,

if you say

\setbox0=\vbox{
{\hsize = 5cm \settabs 3 \columns
 \+column 1&column 2&column 3\cr
 \+one&cattle&herd\cr
 \+two&fish&school\cr
 \+three&lions&pride\cr}
}

\showthe\ht0


\showthe\dp0


you will get the height and depth of that construct.

This doesn't draw a vertical line for measuring, but if that was an
indirect method anyway, you might like this better.

If you really want a rule drawn, try this:

\setbox0=\vbox{
{\hsize = 5cm \settabs 3 \columns
 \+column 1&column 2&column 3\cr
 \+one&cattle&herd\cr
 \+two&fish&school\cr
 \+three&lions&pride\cr}
}
\hbox{\vrule  height \ht0 depth \dp0 \box0}


Cheers.
				Jim

Subject: [texhax] TeX support in Autorevision
Message-ID: <CAFUtaNHCda2W0wQCp=F=vHjVDcQOybtxA1eSHxhoZS+tSm8mNw@mail.gmail.com>

I've added TeX support to Autorevision
(https://github.com/Autorevision/autorevision) and thought folks here
might like to know about this.

Autorevision works similarly to <http://ctan.org/pkg/gitinfo>,
<http://ctan.org/pkg/rcs>, and others, except it supports multiple
repository types (git, hg, svn, and bzr) and multiple languages.

At some point (either in a Makefile or in a checkout hook), run the command

    autorevision -t tex > ar.tex

This produces a file which you can \include{} in your document, and
defines the following macros:

\vcsType
The repository type - "git", "hg", or "svn".

\vcsBasename
The basename of the directory root. For most VCSes this will simply be
the basename of the repository root directory. For Subversion,
autorevision will navigate up though trunk, branches, and tags
directories to find the actual root.

\vcsNum
A count of revisions between the current one and the initial one;
useful for reporting build numbers.

\vcsDate
The date of the most recent commit in true ISO-8601/RFC3339 format,
including seconds.

\vcsBranch
The name of the branch of the commit graph that was selected when
autoversion was run. Under Subversion this will normally be either
trunk or the basename of some branch or tag subdirectory, depending on
where autoversion was run. Under git, this will normally be the
shortname of the current branch (the asterisked line in the output of
of "git branch") except that when the branch doesn?t have a shortname
it will be a full refspec. Under hg the feature that is called
branches is actually a sort of graph coloring (multiple heads can have
the same branch name) so this variable is filled with the current
bookmark if it exists, with the current branch name as a fallback.
Under bzr, this is the nick of the branch you are on.

\vcsTag
The name of the most recent tag ancestral to the current commit. Empty
under Subversion.

\vcsTick
A count of commits since most recent tag ancestral to the current
commit or an alias of vcs_num if there are no prior tags. Empty under
Subversion.

\vcsFullHash
A full unique identifier for the current revision.

\vcsShortHash
A shortened version of \vcsFullHash, but \vcsFullHash if it cannot be shortened.

\vcsWcModified
Set to "true" if the current working directory has been modified and
"false" if not.
[The original documentation says: Set to 1 if the current working
directory has been modified and 0 if not. If the output language is
interpreted and has native Boolean literals, true will mean modified
and false unmodified.]

The generated file is about as simple as can be: a sequence of lines of the form

    \def \vcsType {<type>}

I?m not so excited about my choice of "true" and "false" for
\vcsWcModified, but don?t see a good choice for boolean values outside
Expl3 mode. Perhaps this should be a \newif\vcsIfWcModified ?
Suggestions welcome.

Hi,

I am confused about how to pick up the right font to achieve the same

Here is the simple .tex files.

I wish to have this effect.

This is my working one, need use documentclass \{report\}.

I wish the characters in this one can be as dark and clear as the

The numerical numbers (1,2 ..) and the Greek characters (alpha, beta

The first document is set in Times New Roman and Helvetica; now you
just have to know how to use them in LaTeX (I can't help you there).

Subject: [texhax] How do I set options with mk4ht?
Message-ID: <1355493670.29849.YahooMailNeo@web120902.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

How do I set an option with mk4ht? 


I am trying to get inline footnotes when I am generating html from mk4ht.??

So I have a latex file:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

Sentence.\footnote{Footnote}

\end{document}

I'm using mk4ht (version 2008-06-28-19:09) to convert it to html:

mk4ht? xhmlatex foo.tex


This generates two html files: foo.html and foo2.html?
foo.html has the main text, and foo2.html has the only footnote.? I would instead 

like to have one file foo.html with the footnotes inside.? 


In the file html4.4ht there is:
?? \Log:Note{for inline footnotes use
????????? command line option `fn-in'}
and things like:
\:CheckOption{fn-in}\if:Option


What I can't figure out is how to set the fn-in option.? 


One of my guesses was that I could do this from the command line:

mk4ht xhmlatex foo.tex "" "" "xhtml,fn-in"


However this just gives an warning:
--- warning --- Can't find/open file `xhtml,fn-in.lg'

Another guess was that maybe something like having a config.cfg file:

\Preamble{xhtml}
\begin{document}
\Configure{fn}{fn-in}
\EndPreamble


and the command:


mk4ht xhmlatex foo.tex config
This gives a warning:
l.3 --- TeX4ht warning --- \Configure{fn}? ---

and still produces the two html files.? 

So I haven't figured out how to set options for mk4ht.?

This problem has been discussed here:

  http://tug.org/pipermail/tex4ht/2012q3/000598.html

[...]

One of my guesses was that I could do this from the command line:

It should  be:

   mk4ht xhmlatex foo "xhtml,fn-in"

ie., these are options that should be passed on to tex4ht.sty and hence,
these should be the first set of options.

Another guess was that maybe something like having a config.cfg file:
>

\Preamble{xhtml,fn-in}

The above line is not needed and is wrong.

Thank you.? That solved my question.? 


I am mildly curious if it can be done with a configuration file, but the command line
certainly works.?

Subject: [texhax] Insert chapter and section heading into document header
Message-ID: <20121215133004.165968b7@scorpio>

I am still very new to Latex. I am in the process of creating a
document that requires that the "Chapter" + "Section" + "subsection" if
applicable be included in the document header. This is a large one
sided report.

I have used the "fancyhdr" package to create the footers I required,
but I just cannot get the headers correct.

I used the following to control the vertical spacing or the Chapter
headings.

% Change chapter vertical spacing
\makeatletter
\def\ttl at mkchap@i#1#2#3#4#5#6#7{%
    \ttl at assign\@tempskipa#3\relax\beforetitleunit
    \vspace{\@tempskipa}%<<<<<< REMOVE THE * AFTER \vspace
    \global\@afterindenttrue
    \ifcase#5 \global\@afterindentfalse\fi
    \ttl at assign\@tempskipb#4\relax\aftertitleunit
    \ttl at topmode{\@tempskipb}{%
        \ttl at select{#6}{#1}{#2}{#7}}%
    \ttl at finmarks  % Outside the box!
    \@ifundefined{ttlp@#6}{}{\ttlp at write{#6}}}
\makeatother

I then modified the numbering for my needs.

%Format section numbering
\def\thesection{\arabic{section}.}
\def\thesubsection{\arabic{section}.\Alph{subsection}}
\def\thesubsubsection{\arabic{section}.\Alph{subsection}.\Roman{subsubsection}}

I changed chapter" to "article" which was required since it is a legal
document.

% change chapter to article and center it
\renewcommand{\chaptername}{Article}
\renewcommand{\thechapter}{\Roman{chapter}}
\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\LARGE\bfseries\centering}{\chaptertitlename\ \thechapter}{-0.125in}{\Large}

I then made sure "fancy" was the default style

% Swap plain for fancy when using "chapter" since chapter set the document style to plain
\makeatletter
\let\ps at plain\ps at fancy % :\Let plain be exactly the same as fancy
\makeatother

\begin{document}

% Create Table of Contents
\clearpage
\thispagestyle{fancy}
\pagenumbering{Roman}
\fancyfoot[r]{{\footnotesize \textbf{Contents:\ \thepage}}}
\fancyfoot[l]{{\footnotesize \textbf{\date{01-08-2013}}}}

\setcounter{page}{1}
\thispagestyle{fancy}
\fancyfoot{}

I'll keep this short as others on the list will be more proficient, but I think you'll need to get the information you need into the appropriate \leftmark or \rightmark commands. Although it's a bit confusing, read section 9 of the fancyhdr documentation, noting in particular:

"The \leftmark contains the Left argument of the Last \markboth on the page, the \rightmark
contains the Right argument of the ?Rst \markboth or the only argument of the ?Rst \markright
on the page."

This is designed to be clever in twosided printing, for example, and to show on a spread the information corresponding to the beginning on the left page and the end on the right page (I think). The rest of that section of the documentation shows how to re-define, e.g., \sectionmark (which is called when you issue a \section command) to put the information you want, and format it as you want, into \markboth or \markright. I'll stop here as I've hit the limit of my ignorance, but suggest you play with these and replace your 

\fancyhead{r}{\chaptertitlename\ \thechapter\ \thesection \thesubsection}

with something like

\fancyhead{r}{\rightmark}

In essence, your problem stems from the fact that the output from things like \thechapter depends on WHEN in your latex run that command is executed and the header put together by latex.

I am beginning to think it either cannot be done; or at the very least,
it is beyond my skill level. Since I used code that forces all of the
"chapters" to run together rather than each starting on a new page, it
appears that I cannot accomplish my task. I just spend over two hours
trying every thing I know without success.

What pisses me off is that I can do this in MS Word.

I'm pretty sure it is doable, but it might not be straightforward.  If nothing else, you could save a reference to each chapter as you create the chapter mark, then in your heading, compare the current page number to each chapter start page in the list and then decide which chapter number(s) to show.

That said, since your change won't ever affect the number of lines, you might also be able to do something clever like overwriting the existing line when you hit a chapter mark, or moving the chapter mark drawing code into AddToShipoutPicture so that it gets processed at the end of the page (after you have changed the chapter number).

Incidentally, if you're starting chapters in the middle of a page, I'd be tempted to show both chapter numbers on the first page of the chapter unless the heading falls at the start of a page.  The code for doing so is left as an exercise for the reader, but probably involves comparing the current drawing position to the top of the page....

I am (1) sure it is possible and (2) beyond my skill level. I have
written about this question on several other forums and been informed
several times that it is probably possible; however, no one knows how
to do it.

I was lucky that I was able to get MS Word to create the document in
the form specified. I will continue to investigate this further on
though and if I ever do learn how to accomplish it, I will write it up.

First, I don't think you mean for the headings to look like
"The Chapter Title I 2.2.5"... you have repeated the section 
number ("2").

I don't belive you want the chapter number after the chapter 
title. That was probably sloppy typing/asking though, because
your report of "Article II 1.1.C" below suggests you really used:
\fancyhead{r}{\chaptername\ \thechapter\ \thesection \thesubsection}

> The problem is that it does not stay in sync with the document.

Now the meat of your problem: You have not defined the things that 
are supposed to control the headers! They are \chaptermark, \sectionmark, 
and \subsectionmark.

% Note that the section number is included in \thesubsection
\renewcommand\chaptermark[1]{\markright{\chaptername\ \thechapter}}
\renewcommand\sectionmark[1]{\markright{\chaptername\ \thechapter\ \thesection}}
\renewcommand\subsectionmark[1]{\markright{\chaptername\ \thechapter\ \thesubsection}}

And your heading should specify:

\fancyhead{r}{\rightmark}

If you want to include the actual title in any of the header marks, use "#1" in the
definition of the relevant mark command.

If you really are a beginner diving into internal macros and document-class
creation, then ask when you get confused about what to define, before getting
pissed off.

Sorry if I appear "pissed off", but I really am not. I believe the word
that would most correctly describe the situation is "frustrated". In
any case, I believe I have tried all that you described above;
however, I will take a fresh look at it perhaps later today or
definitely sometime this week.

Since the project was completed successfully in MS Word, there is no
longer an urgency to it. However, I would like to learn more about
Latex. By the way, your remark, "If you want to include the actual
title in any of the header marks, use "#1" in the definition of the
relevant mark command", is the first I have seen of that. Finding
accurate, concise documentation in a centralized location appears to
be as hard as finding a virgin in a whore house. At least that has been
my experience so far. I would love to find an all encompassing book,
but have not been able to locate such an item. Do you have any
suggestions?

In section 9 of the fancyhdr manual:

   if ?Section 2.2. First steps? is the current section, then

     \renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markright{\thesection.\ #1}}

   will give ?2.2. First steps?

You've said you're frustrated, but I'm not sure your analogy helps.
Indeed, it sounds childish.

The texdoc command will pull up the manual for a package.  For
instance:

  $ texdoc fancyhdr

starts a pdf reader with the fancyhdr manual.

Compared to other code bases I've worked with, LaTeX packages are very
well documented.  If you need an introduction to LaTeX, the not so
short guide to LaTeX and Lamport's book are both excellent.

I would sincerely hope that no child would be in a position
to knowledgeably offer a simile based on the demographics of
the occupants of a place of prostitution :-)

Well, as pertinacious as you may be in you opinion, I personally
believe lying to children is about as bad an example as can be set by a
responsible adult. Feeding  a child lies; ie, "there is a Santa
Clause", or "Easter Bunny", or "God" etcetera is far worse them
informing them of the truth. However, none of this banter belongs on
this forum. I would enjoy debating it with you off-list though if you
would like.

You had used the word "pissed". I hope the frustration diminishes.
LaTeX *is* hard for the beginner.  

> any case, I believe I have tried all that you described above;

Clearly not all together.  Perhaps you defined the xxx-mark commands
in a try where your header layout made no reference to \rightmark.

I used your suggestions from an earlier email. They worked better than
the ones I was using; however, it still fails to keep in sync with the
page or writes a totally cryptic header. Since it works correctly on
some pages and wrong on others, I am trying to diagnose exactly what is
causing it to fail. So far my Sherlock Homes skills are betraying me.

I am thinking of creating a stripped down document that still exhibits
the problem I am describing and forwarding it to you for your analyses.
I fully realize that this is not your problem nor what you do; however,
if you are interested please let me know. We could do this off-list so
as not to pollute the forum environment. I take no offense if you are
not interested. In any case, thanks for your assistance. At least I am
heading in the right direction.

Even a "stripped down" version would be far to large to post here. I
will post a link to it when I get a chance to parse the original

Message-ID: <1356289717.60175.YahooMailNeo@web126203.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Good morning?Congratulations for your effort!!!My name is Doukissas Leonidas,?
i am ?from Greece and i'm using Latex (with Winedt editor) the last month and i am excited!My only problem is that although?I've?written up to 50 page in Latex (with?\documentclass{amsart}),when i try the same code with the same technique ((with?\documentclass{book}) the compiler fails and doesn't recognize my keybord's greek symbols.As a result when i create the pdf displays #*#*#*0* in stead of greek symbols as well. For example?


\documentclass{amsart}
\usepackage[greek,]{babel}
\usepackage[iso-8859-7]{inputenc}
\newtheorem{???????}{???????}
{\bf ?????? ????????:}\newline
$Glivenko- \,Gantelli$
$$F_{n}(x)\rightarrow F(x),\,\,\,\forall x$$
??? ? \,$F$\,????? ??????? ???? \,$\Rightarrow$\,? ???????? ????? ?????????? ??????
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\sup_{x\in \,\mathbb{R}\,}|F_{n}(x)-F(x)|=0$$

It works properly with {amsart}, and when i change to \documentclass{book} and i leave the rest as it is, it doesn't work.
As a second example i mention this strange fact.It displays normally "Chapter 1 (in greek)"but the greek word "??????" is displayed as 0?0?0?0?.
\documentclass[12pt,]{book}
\usepackage[greek]{babel}
\usepackage[iso-8859-7]{inputenc}
\begin{document}
\chapter{?????? }
\end{document}
?
Could you please give me an advice what should i do?
??
Yours sincerely

Dear TeX users,

Well, the world didn't end as predicted, so I suppose I need to
write yet another newsletter to round out the year.

2012 was a good year for TeX and TUG, with progress being made
on several fronts. Of course, more participation is always
welcome. If you wish to run for a position as a TUG officer,
now's your chance: 2013 is an election year. See all the details
at http://tug.org/election.

And don't forget that TUG 2013 will be in Tokyo.  Deadline for
presentation proposals and more is July 15.  More details as they become
available will be on the TUG website (http://tug.org/tug2013).


More news:
- TUGboat 33:3, the last issue of 2012, is now online and in the 
   mail (if it hasn't reached you. Mine got here last week, and I'm
   usually among the last to get my issue). And consider writing something
   for the next issue. Articles on any aspect of TeX and friends are 
   always welcomed. Deadline for the next issue is March 1.
   http://tug.org/TUGboat/


- The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (aka CTAN) now features an
   all-new, enhanced website. Point your browsers at
   http://www.ctan.org

I suspect you found my web page
(http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/latex.html) which contains a lot of
infomration about using LaTeX - and it can be overwhelming.

The best source for all things tex is:

The TeX Users Group web site
http://tug.org/

You should be able to download LaTeX from there.

However, I suspect that Ubuntu may already have LaTex.  If not,
google:
latex on ubuntu
picks up a bunch of pages.

I'm ccing this to TeXHaX which is a news group with experts who can
help you more than I.

Good luck and have fun!

While I agree w/ everything Tom wrote, I believe you might be more comfortable w/ a graphical front end for LaTeX, LyX:

http://www.lyx.org

There's specific mention of Ubuntu at:

http://www.lyx.org/Download

so it should be straight-forward to get running.

Once you have LyX installed it has very good documentation, including a bit on the distinction between TeX (the compiler), LaTeX (the pre-processor / macro package / markup standard) and the front-end (which can be a text editor w/ a button to typeset the file or a visual front-end like LyX).

Hi Fenghelong,
you can use 

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/examples/template-zh.tex

as a template.  You have to download

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/examples/picture.jpg

as well in order to be able to compile the document.

I can compile the document with pdflatex but not with xelatex or
lualatex, so pdflatex is your friend.

Your text editor has to be configured to use UTF-8 encoding.  This is
important.  If your editor doesn't display Chinese characters
properly, don't save the file and use a better one.

On Windows the best one is TeXworks, which is shipped with both, TeX
Live and MiKTeX.  If there isn't an icon on the desktop, you'll find
it in the start menu.  On other systems editors use UTF-8 by default.

If you have further questions, please tell us which operating you are
using and - if it's Windows - which TeX distribution (TeX Live or MiKTeX).
It's easier to help you if we know more about your environment.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I have no problem with Chinese people, or any other nationality or 
race looking for work.

I do have a problem with resumes, and the conventional process (in 
the western world) of finding employees.

I'm 52 and it was about 12 years ago that I discovered that I have 
Autism.  Discovering I had Autism explained a lot of observances I 
had acquired over the years, so far it hasn't produced a solution.  
But knowing there is a reason for a problem is the closure that 
many people seek when confronted with the death of a loved one.

Knowing that I was Autistic, has led me to find problems with the 
existing hiring process.  Employers and government aren't 
interested in hearing about these problems.  Even if I try to 
phrase things in a generic context (no mention of Autism), I get 
no response.

People in society are always producing new ways to help employers 
find employees.  Some of these obviously discriminate against 
people with Autism.  When presented with evidence, they are not 
interested.

As near as I can tell, mankind is not interested in being a fair 
employer.

In terms of people applying for jobs (job applications or 
resumes), I think the best solution is that people provide a 
marked up document (such as something based on XML), and that if 
at some point someone on the hiring side wants something printed, 
it gets printed according to formatting rules for the 
organization.  All applications that get printed, use the same 
typesize, same font, same inter-glyph spacing, same kerning, and 
all the other minor details which go into typesetting a document.

But what do I know?  I'm just a M.Eng. from one of the world's 
best engineering schools, who after 26 years, is still looking for 
my first job where the job title is "Engineer".

I've never relied on status for anything, in writing the above 
paragraph I have used the fact that some people recognize status.

Sorry, this doesn't solve how to make a resume.

I wish you the best in pursuing your career.

I suppose that it's best to concentrate on very young and small
companies.

The reason is that those little companies don't have stupid human
resources departments.

And one more hint: If you find a job offer, don't hesitate to use the
telephone.  Most people are too shy.

First of all, allow me to say that I am sincerely sorry to hear that
you are having problems finding suitable employment. However, that is a
problem that has plagued many individuals now for several years. My
sister was a paraplegic and had trouble at first finding suitable
employment. It took a lot of work, both by her and her family to find
suitable employment for her.

In the United States, the only country whose laws I am familiar with,
there are laws against discrimination in the hiring of people with
disabilities. Yes, unfortunately, they are not always uniformly
enforced but they do make a difference. I am not familiar with your
locale; however, there might be similar statues that you can avail
yourself of.

I also noticed that you used the term "autism" in a very general
manner. Autism is a generic word. Without knowing the specific type of
autism that you have been diagnosed with, I really cannot help you in a
more specific manner.

Good luck.

In amsmath book, why does the \infty (infinity) symbol display so small in
math mode in comparison to other maths characters , say, x, y or a greek
letter such as \beta (Beta)?

Is there a way of scaling the \infty only?

I would prefer it to be larger rather than bolded.

    In amsmath book, why does the \infty (infinity) symbol display so small in
    math mode in comparison to other maths characters , say, x, y or a greek
    letter such as \beta (Beta)?

the first question to ask is, what fonts
are being used?  in the computer modern
fonts, the size of \infty compares favorably
with that of x -- the height is the same,
and it's wider (about the width of m).  this
is the traditional size and shape.  (a good
reference as to the history of the symbol
and its use is "a history of mathematical
notations", by florian cajori, section 421.)

    Is there a way of scaling the \infty only?

again, this depends on what fonts are used.

    I would prefer it to be larger rather than bolded.

where can we see an example?

    I have these entered at the beginning of the "usepackages".

    \usepackage{amsmath,bm} % was amsbook,bm
    \usepackage{amsfonts} %
    \usepackage{appendix} %
    \usepackage{palatino} %
    \usepackage{bookman} %
    \usepackage{helvet} %
    \usepackage{amssymb} %
    \usepackage{amsthm} %
    \usepackage{fix-cm} % metric font size
    \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} %

    When I reach a line like:
    \noindent \fontsize{11.0}{11.0}\selectfont{value will approach
    \hspace{2pt}$x^2+3x-7 + a_5+ a_3 + a^2+ a^3\hspace{2pt}-\infty\hspace{2pt}
    \beta$},

    The infinity seems out of all proportion to the x, y, and beta - even to
    the minus sign.
    Can you somehow get a "fontsize" command inside the math mode section?

too many fonts loaded here for me to make a
stab at defining an 11-point math environment;
i've added math at "larger" sizes many times
for headings in ams plain-tex document styles,
and the ams latex document classes "do the
right thing", but they use only cm fonts.

the font size definitions for cm math symbols
are in the file omscmsy.fd in the latex/base
area of tex live; this is called from the
file fontmath.ltx, same area.  i think you'll
need something like this to increase the
size of \infty when used with palatino or
bookman, plus the calling mechanism.  in
the latex/palatino area there's a file
omsupl.fd but i'm not sure where it's called
from.  that info might be a start.

    Subject: Re: [texhax] Infinity symbol output too small
    
        In amsmath book, why does the \infty (infinity) symbol display so small
        in math mode in comparison to other maths characters , say, x, y or a
        greek letter such as \beta (Beta)?
    
    the first question to ask is, what fonts are being used?  in the computer
    modern fonts, the size of \infty compares favorably with that of x -- the
    height is the same, and it's wider (about the width of m).  this is the
    traditional size and shape.  (a good reference as to the history of the
    symbol and its use is "a history of mathematical notations", by florian
    cajori, section 421.)
    
        Is there a way of scaling the \infty only?
    
    again, this depends on what fonts are used.
    
        I would prefer it to be larger rather than bolded.
    
    where can we see an example?
