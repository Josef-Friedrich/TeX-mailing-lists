\spacefactor is what makes sense, but it has its limitations.  Perhaps
best is to define two commands \acr and \Acr and choose them manually
(just as you choose between "The" and "the" manually).

Incorporate \ifhmode or \ifvmode as part of the test.  Note that
the usual \leavevmode will get rid of the error, but will not
capitalize the first letter of the paragraph.

Space factors are legitimately under the control of the language.
To use them yourself you'd need to override whatever settings the
language specifies.  I don't know the mechanism in polyglossia,
but there must be one.

I am very surprised that it works with \frenchspacing!  Are you sure
you tested properly?  Perhaps you declared \frenchspacing before setting
your own \sfcodes, so the \frenchspacing was irrelevant.

Well,  i was searching in the web, and found the solution, at least
for the equation, only add after \label{eq}:

Hi 

? 

I am trying to create an index for an article. I have read Leslie Lamport's MakeIndex article and have the following questions: 

? 

1) the article says "Next, run the MakeIndex program by typing the following Unix command: makeindex myfile . idx . How do I perform this task under a Windows operating system? 

? 

2) When I include the \ printindex command in my . tex file I get an error message saying "unrecognized command". What command do I include to print the index in the document? 

? 

3) Are there beginner courses in Latex somewhere near where I live in Albuquerque, NM? 

? 

Thank you, in advance for your time and consideration. 

?

Do you use an editor for LaTeX, such as TeXworks or Texniccenter? My
TeXworks has (besides pdflatex, xelatex, etc) an pulldown item for
makeindex. You can however open the command shell
(http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/947-command-prompt.html) and run
the command.

The following example works and generates two pages:

\documentclass{scrartcl}
\usepackage[]{makeidx}
\makeindex
\begin{document}

Hallo Welt!

\index{Hallo}

\printindex

\end{document}

a) Run it through latex (pdflatex, xelatex, ...)
b) Call makeindex
c) Run it through latex again

No idea! I'm sitting in Germany. You could check local colleges or
universities if they offer courses.

No.  It sais 

  makeindex myfile.idx

Same as under Unix.

Please simply do what the documentation says and do not put arbitrary
space characters into file names and LaTeX commands. 

Furthermore, I recommend to configure the Windows Exploder to display
filename extensions too.  Then you see complete file names, not only
parts of them, in directory listings.

  Reinhard

I definitely prefer (2.2.1)--(2.2.8) unless I am using hyperref and
formulae spread across several pages, because there are no links to
(2.2.2),...,(2.2.7). In the latter case I believe one should be even
more detailed and list separately all formulae, or at least group them
so each page would be represented.

I am adding texhax as this is not MacOSX specific question.

I want to reverse occasional letters or words, reversion
in the sense of the letter or word being white on a black
(or dark gray) background.

If you could provide me with a macro to do this, that
would be wonderful.

Something like this?

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\newcommand{\reversedtext}[1]{\colorbox[gray]{0}{\textcolor[gray]{1}{#1}}}
\begin{document}
\reversedtext{reversed text}
\end{document}

0== black, 1 == white, values in-betwixt for grey tints.

Yes. You'll need to use either pdflatex or xelatex (or lualatex) for best results as I understand it.

For the former you'll want to \usepackage{cmap}.

I get copy/pastable PDFs in Acrobat 8.3.1 (professional) and Adobe
Reader 9.5.1 by the latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf route.  I just checked. 
I downloaded the latest Adobe Reader 10.1.3 (Mac OS X) and it worked
for cut/paste too.  I've never seen a problem with cut/paste.

Did you try a file containing non-ASCII characters?  I assume that
only then the cmap package is needed.

I'm using T1 font encoding, does that matter?

Using pdflatex, the resulting pdf seems to work with copy/paste in adobe. The
resulting pdf doesn't look as nice, presumably because it's relying on the pdf
viewer to display the fonts properly instead of drawing all of the curves
itself...

BTw, I've discovered that going directly to pdf using dvipdf creates
selectable/searchable pdfs as well. The problem seems to be in going through
postscript.

If you compile the following sample
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\section{one}
  \subsubsection{A subsubsection}
\section{two}
  \subsubsection{A subsubsection}
\end{document}

you will see that the first subsubsection is correctly named 1.0.1, but 
the second is called 2.0.2 instead of the expected 2.0.1.  Now I don't 
know why one would want a subsubsection with no subsection, but one of the 
contributors to the online journal whose class files I maintain did and is 
now complaining about this bug.  It clearly comes from the line
\newcounter {subsubsection}[subsection]

The Section counter, when incremented, resets the Subsection counter; 
Subsection when it is incremented/reset resets the Subsubsection counter 
but it must be used for the effect to take place; etc. In your example, 
Subsection doesn't appear so the chain is broken.

Sorry I said that wrong - didn't read carefully before sending. Here's 
try 2:

The Section counter, when incremented, resets the Subsection counter; 
Subsection when it is incremented resets the Subsubsection counter, etc. 
Subsection doesn't appear in your example so, while it is reset, it is 
never incremented and, therefore,  the chain is broken and Subsubsection 
isn't reset.

Dear TeX users,

The Ides of May is upon us. This month, I'd like to ask for your help on
a couple of fronts:

If you've ever been thinking about sharing your experiences with TeX by
speaking at a conference (and who hasn't), now's your chance! We still
have slots available for speakers. The deadline is May 21. Send title
and abstract to tug2012 at tug.org. (And even if you don't want to present,
please join us in Boston anyway. See below.)

Also, there are a number of worthy tasks looking for volunteers.
Karl Berry maintains a list of projects in the TeX community looking for
help: http://www.tug.org/help

More news:

- New corrected printings of Computers and Typesetting are (or will be)
  available.  Donald E. Knuth writes: "...the books themselves are
  significantly better in hundreds of small ways. I went through every
  page very carefully and introduced many refinements, which have made
  me extremely happy with the result. I'm now able to replace my
  personal desk copies, in which hundreds of handwritten notes had been
  scrawled since the Millennium edition came out, by fresh versions that
  are essentially perfect (as far as I know).  This is especially true
  of Volume B, because important updates to the TeX software that were
  made in 2002 and 2007 have never before been available in print."
  See the section entitled Spiffy New Printings at
  http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/abcde.html

- We are pleased to be able to offer the Lucida fonts in OpenType format.
  The Type 1 Lucida fonts are frozen and will not be developed further,
  while the OpenType fonts continue to be actively maintained and
  developed. The OpenType fonts support more languages, with a variety
  of visual improvements to their glyphs and spacing. Lucida OpenType is
  also one of the few font sets currently supporting OpenType
  mathematical typesetting, and (uniquely, to our knowledge) provides a
  bold math variant. The regular-weight Lucida OpenType math font
  includes a newly-designed script alphabet design.
  http://tug.org/lucida


- TUGboat 33:1 has been mailed to members. As always, TUGboat needs
  your article/review/blurb/ musing for the next issue. Articles on any
  aspect of TeX and friends are always welcomed.
  http://tug.org/TUGboat/


- TeX Live '11 is now frozen, which means the pretesting for
  TL'12 has started. Come and give it a try if you're interested.
  http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html
   
 
- As previously mentioned, TUG 2012 will be held in Boston,
  Massachusetts, USA, from July 16 through July 18 at the
  Omni Parker House. The discount code for our group's hotel
  reservations, registration forms, and other information is at:

Hi list, i am doing a presentation using Beamer, and the problem i
have it when i put the numbers of figures, i uses:

\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage[spanish,activeacute]{babel} % acentos comunes
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %si se usa Windows cambiar utf8 por latin1
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\usepackage{upgreek}
\usepackage{times}

\usepackage{textcomp}
\usepackage[intlimits]{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{capt-of}
\usepackage{captdef}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usetheme{Goettingen}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

% for example
\begin{frame}

\begin{center}
\frametitle{Campana de resonancia}
{\includegraphics[width=50mm,height=20mm]{/media/datos/Laboratorio2/ultrasonido/espectro_sonoro}}
\captionof{figure}{\small{Espectro sonoro}}
\label{espectro}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

when i compile does not appear for example "Figure n: Espectro sonoro"
This is my first use in this environment, but in
\documentclass{article} and the numbers on figures working perfectly.

Thanks all

this label did not seem in figure environment. I never try this. Just a

Well the solution was, before of \begin{document} insert
\setbeamertemplate{caption}[numbered]

and numerated the figures.

Subject: [texhax] texhax Digest, Vol 2012, Issue 125
Message-ID: <tencent_7654E77374BFE094496B1D1F@qq.com>

Hi texhax group,


I am using latex to write my undergraduate thesis and the bibliography format requirement of our school really annoyed me. I hope someone in this group could help me out.


I set up a wee example here for suggestions.
There are two files. One is the main content and another is bibliography database file.


main.tex file:


\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{natbib}
\begin{document}
In this example, I will cite two articles.
They are \citep{schneider1990} and \citep{yu1995}
\bibliography{tex}
\bibliographystyle{plainnat}
\end{document}



tex.bib file:


@article{schneider1990,
author = "Schneider T.D.and Stephens R.M.",
title = "{Sequence Logos: A New Way to 
 Display Consensus Sequences}",
journal = "Nucleic Acids Res.",
volume = 18,
pages = "6097--6100",
year = 1990
}
@article{yu1995,
author = "Yu W. and Schuster W.",
title = "Evidence for a site-specific 
 cytidine deamination reaction involved 
 in C to U RNA editing of plant 
 mitochondria.",
journal = "J. Biol. Chem.",
volume = 270,
number = 31,
pages = "18227--18233",
month = Aug,
year = 1995
}



Just put the two files above in the same directory and employ pdflatex to compile it. You should see the output. 


The reference output is like this:


References
Schneider T.D.and Stephens R.M. Sequence Logos: A New Way to Display
Consensus Sequences. Nucleic Acids Res., 18:6097?6100, 1990.
Yu W. and Schuster W. Evidence for a site-specific cytidine deamination reac-
tion involved in c to u rna editing of plant mitochondria. J. Biol. Chem., 270
(31):18227?18233, August 1995.





My problem is how to number each bibliography entry. According to the thesis format requirement of our university, I need to number the two literature without affecting the citing style, ie (author, year) in my content. The desired output is something like this:


References
[1] Schneider T.D.and Stephens R.M. Sequence Logos: A New Way to Display
Consensus Sequences. Nucleic Acids Res., 18:6097?6100, 1990.
[2] Yu W. and Schuster W. Evidence for a site-specific cytidine deamination reac-
tion involved in c to u rna editing of plant mitochondria. J. Biol. Chem., 270
(31):18227?18233, August 1995.



I know this counting is meaningless, but I have to conform it. Can anyone give me a hand?


Many Thanks!!

Hi Ruan,

the numbers of reference is determined by the bibliographystyle which you
used plainnat here. Please check this:
http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/reference/faq/bibstyles.html

there are quite a few ways you can choose beside plainnat, try plain to see
the difference from the plainnat. I attached the effect use plain.

if there is really no style fit for you. Then find the plain.sty file,
change the content and put under the same directory. I personally never
try. So I do not have experience for this way.

Good luck.

Hi Ruan,

Sorry for not checking what you said in the first email carefully.

I think it really takes time to change the .sty file, either the
plainnat.sty or plain.sty. There is a easy way to cheat with this. You can
open the a.bbl file, add the numbers manually after you run bibtex a.aux.

Let me know by which way you figure out. Thanks.

The example below does not work in {beamer} but works in {article} (if
removed \begin{frame} and \end{frame} and load hyperref and ams math.

Also it works in beamer if

\tag*{$(\ref*{eq-1})^*$}\label{eq-1-*}

is replaced by
\tag*{$(1)^*$}\label{eq-1-*}

\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage[english]{babel}

\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
\begin{equation}
1+1=2
\label{eq-1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
1+2=3
\tag*{$(\ref*{eq-1})^*$}\label{eq-1-*}
%\tag*{$(1)^*$}\label{eq-1-*}
\end{equation}

\end{frame}
\end{document}

If pdfTeX or LuaTeX are used, then package pdfrender might help.

I started on it:

\documentclass[showtrims]{memoir}
\setstocksize{610bp}{456bp}
\settrimmedsize{538bp}{384bp}{*}
\settrims{36bp}{36bp}

\setsansfont{Univers LT Std 67 Bold Condensed}

\usepackage{xcolor}
\definecolor{cmykwhite}{cmyk}{0,0,0,0}
\definecolor{cmykburgundy}{cmyk}{0,0.95,1.0,0.3}


\usepackage{atbegshi}
\AtBeginShipout{\special{pdf: put @thispage <</TrimBox [36.0 36.0 420.0 574.0]>>}}
\special{pdf: put @thispage <</TrimBox [36.0 36.0 420.0 574.0]>>}

\begin{document}
\fontsize{100bp}{120bp}\selectfont \textsf{\color{cmykburgundy}{1}}
\end{document}

Problems w/ what you want to achieve:

 - using OpenType fonts --- that requires that the above be typeset w/ xelatex or lualatex
 - using PANTONE spot colours --- there's support for doing this in pdftex if memory serves, but not in xetex AIUI (times like this, I really miss the pervasive licensing of PANTONE swatch libraries in NeXTstep)
 - the text at the back is converted to paths and outlined --- one would need to use pstricks or tikz or something along those lines to do this, which AIUI, precludes the use of OpenType fonts.

but that technique only works easily for individual letters --- you might be able to get farther by using \uspackage{soul} to space out the foreground copy to align against the background.

there is a question addressing this situation
in the ams author-faq.  go to this site
  http://www.ams.org/author-faq
and search for  "one appendix"  (including
the quotes).  the answer to this question
should help with resolving your problem.

Hello all. Instead of

  \newcommand{\lcall}{\lcallwithasillysuffix\xspace}
  \begin{document}
  \lcall
  \end{document}

I would like to be able to do

This doesn't work :

\documentclass{paper}

\usepackage{datetime}
\usepackage{xspace}
%\verbdef{\lcallsillysuffix}{LC_ALL}
%\newcommand{\lcall}{\lcallsillysuffix\xspace}
\newcommand{\lit}[2]{

}
\lit{lcall}{LC_ALL}
\begin{document}
\xxivtime \ \lcall \xxivtime

(The call to \lit triggers a bunch of errors starting with
"! Missing = inserted for \ifnum.").

Anyone can see what my mistake is ? Thanks in advance.

TeX (/qua/ TeX) has no intrinsict support for graphics, Jpeg or
otherwise.  Traditionally this was circumvented by using a
TeX \special to pass information concerning the required
graphic to the DVI driver, which would then incorporate
this graphic.  Thus if you are using TeX, it is your DVI
driver documentation that you need to study in order to
find the answer to your question.

However, if you are willing to use one of the more modern
TeX derivatives (PdfTeX, XeTeX, LuaTeX, ...) you will find
that each of them provides intrinsic support for the
incorporation of graphics, and (to the best of my belief)
all support the inclusion of Jpegs.

An example, for XeTeX :

	\XeTeXpicfile Resources/Images/#1.jpg width 0,7\hsize \relax

and for PdfTeX :

	\immediate \pdfximage width 2in 
{D:/TeX/Projects/Correspondence/Philip-Taylor.1.jpg}
	{\pdfrefximage \pdflastximage}

My choice would be to use any tool that would transfer them to EPS 
format.  Then they could be scaled to fit, using dvips (although often 
within only narrow limits owing to the inflexibility of bit-map formats) .
