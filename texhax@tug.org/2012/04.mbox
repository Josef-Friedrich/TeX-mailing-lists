Thanks all for the replies.

I would prefer to have only the texlive2011 installation, and not the one which performed by the debian installer.

After I purge the debian tex packages, how do I make texlive the working installation (in terms of directories being searched etc.)?.

TIA

No need to purge the Debian packages.  Just prepend
path/to/the/texlive/bin/directory to $PATH.

The TeX Live installer already sais:

   Add /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf/doc/man to MANPATH, if not dynamically determined.
   Add /usr/local/texlive/2011/texmf/doc/info to INFOPATH.

   Most importantly, add /usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/x86_64-linux
   to your PATH for current and future sessions.


Maybe the word "add" should be replaced by "prepend".

Regards,
  Reinhard

I already told you how in login.defs, whether you ?purge? the Debian 
packages or not.

But as Reinhard and Lars have already said, there is no need to do that, 
unless you are really short of disk space ---Lars told you it's a good 
idea to keep those packages to satisfy dependencies for other Debian 
packages (that's exactly what I do).

If you insist to do that, or need to free disk space, read ?Integrating 
vanilla TeX Live with Debian? in

Message-ID: <CACgVjARDWObKoU=6V5ObbqUbHP09UdVMCVWpxTOfPaUP9ZuKZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all:

I'm soliciting opinions about the correct spacing for em dashes --- the
kind that you use to interrupt text like this.  A space on either side of
the dash seems too airy to be right, and no space seems way too tight.
Tiny spaces (\,) are awkward to type, but maybe that's what one needs?
Also opinions about whether it's ok to end a line with a dash --- and how
I'd prevent it if it's not --- are welcome.

Thank you,

I had thought there's a certain amount of spacing built into the \dash and \Dash macros which are used in TUGboat.

Looking at ltugboat.cls maybe I'm wrong?

\def\dash{\d at sh\nobreak\endash}
\def\Dash{\d at sh\nobreak\emdash}

Usually when I mislike a full em dash enough to find it distasteful where's a 3/4 em dash available in the font which is spaced more openly. (em dashes are usually tight for those instances when multiples are combined)

tom sgouros asks about dashes and spacing
around them.  (hi, tom.)

william adams answers,
    
    I had thought there's a certain amount of spacing built into the \dash
    and \Dash macros which are used in TUGboat.

yes, you're right, because i don't like
the em-dash crashing into the words on
either side.

    Looking at ltugboat.cls maybe I'm wrong?

    \def\dash{\d at sh\nobreak\endash}
    \def\Dash{\d at sh\nobreak\emdash}

but you didn't look at the definition of
\d at sh:

  \def\d at sh#1#2{\unskip#1\thinskip#2\thinskip\ignorespaces}

\thinskip *is* breakable, hence the \nobreak
following the first one.  could have used
\, there, but this was first created for
plain tex, where \, was math only, and,
besides, having a command that "reads" the
same on both sides is more easily understood
by the next poor macro writer.

    Usually when I mislike a full em dash enough to find it distasteful
    where's a 3/4 em dash available in the font which is spaced more
    openly. (em dashes are usually tight for those instances when multiples
    are combined)

i don't have bringhurst available to check,
but i seem to remember he advocates using
an en dash will full space on either side.

the latest chicago doesn't say anything
about spacing explicitly, but there is a
small but visible space (a little more than
a hairline, but less than a thin space) on
either side of the em-dashes in examples.

by the way, for tugboat, authors sometimes
use \dash between numbers.  wrong!  in that
situation, an unspaced en-dash is what's
wanted.

as for breaking after an em-dash, i have
no problem with that.  it appears thus in
fowler, so i feel justified (sorry 'bout
that; it *is* april 1).

I guess you mean tabla-n instead of table-n, as table is not an Spanish 
word. Anyway, you can read how to make changes to the Spanish defaults 
in Babel in the documentation ---in your terminal type

	texdoc spanish

and in the PDF that opens (page 6) you'll find that the option es-tabla 
will change the \tablename from cuadro to tabla every time you use 
\begin{table}.

Thanks for the info, i solved writing in the preambule:

\renewcommand{\spanishtablename}{Tabla} 

and now the tables are tables!

It's much more convenient to type and read than \Dash.  I suspect it of

tom,

    Thank you all for the opinions --- justified and otherwise.  Is there a way
    to just redefine --- to have a tiny little space like Barbara's \Dash?
    It's much more convenient to type and read than \Dash.  I suspect it of
    being a macro somewhere (after all, what isn't?), but it's the first one
    whose definition I can't seem to find, presumably because of some dark
    \chardef magic.

not \chardef, but ligaturing info in the
.tfm files.  -- is ligatured to the en-dash,
and the en-dash plus a hyphen is ligatured
to the em-dash.  (type in four hyphens in
a row and see what happens.)

so, not easy to insert a space other than
as a macro.  i suppose you *could* "adjust"
the metrics to do it.  since the em-dash
isn't ligatured to anything else, a single
one wouldn't result in anything unsightly,
but there are a couple of good reasons
not to do that:
 - if you insist on entering a 3-em dash
   in a bibliography as a string of nine
   hyphens, there would be gaps;
 - your font(s) would be nonstandard and
   your source code wouldn't compile
   elsewhere with the same result.
i *know* you don't send your source code
off on its own, but mods like this are
still not desirable (even if you change
the file names, as i know you would).

possible (macro) workaround:  if you
don't have need for the macron, you could
consider redefining \= to be an em-dash
with tiny spaces around it.  still not
ideal, but a bit less onerous than \Dash.

Aha, I get it.  Plus I feel better about not being able to find it.

Does this mean that the spacing (or lack thereof) varies from font to
font?

re spacing around an em-dash:

    Does this mean that the spacing (or lack thereof) varies from font to
    font?

i can't speak with firsthand knowledge
for anything but computer modern.  but
i very much doubt that there is space
around an em-dash in other fonts because
one of the functions of an em-dash (at
least in metal) is to allow multiple
dashes to be set butted up against one
another to make a solid line, and for
that, spacing would be counterproductive.

Message-ID: <CALSq=BYBumtz-J6=XYfNR1WH59ige5Q5gXmiT5+T3-65rdBN0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

(From Google search results, I think this is a right mailing list to
send this query to. Please let me know a better list if not. :)

Hyperref includes the hyperfootnotes option which makes the
footnotemark in the text link down to the start of the footnote. Does
anyone know if there is a way that also makes the footnotemark that
starts the footnote link backwards into the text where the footnote is
referred from? This would be like backref/pagebackref in the
bibliography, but for footnotes.

Thanks,
Dan (please cc me on replies as I'm not subscribed)

I just checked:  adding \newpage before 
\bibliography{all}
made the bibliography go to the next page.

I don't know what you did or what the results were.  It would help to
explain the problem in step-by-step detail and maybe include a small
working example.  This page describes how to report errors:

http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/bugs.html

I suggest reading it before sending more reports.  We can't help you
if we don't understand the problem.

In general not a good idea.

What's the purpose of the "\qquad"s?

What happens, if you put a \clearpage after the table?
Perhaps the real table is too large for the page?

If there isn't text in the appendix, just the table, you could
also use a non-floating table, e.g.:

\usepackage{capt-of} % in the preamble

\chapter*{Appendix}
\begin{tabular}...\end{tabular}
\captionof{figure}{value for.}


Or

\usepackage{float} % in the preamble

\chapter*{Appendix}
\begin{table}{H}
  \begin{tabular}...\end{tabular}
  \caption{value for.}
\end{table}

If the table is too long for a page, then consider packages
longtable or supertabular.

Yours sincerely

This works for me.  That is, the bibliography appears on a page by its
own.  Removing the \newpage makes it appear a page earlier.

So I can't replicate your problem.  Please read:

again carefully.  Then trim your file to the absolute minimum that
still shows the problem.

You may notice the table is very slim. use those \qquad to move it
into the quasi-middle of the page.

Might be clumsy, I did this table one year ago and can't remember why
came so many spaces to move it into middle.

Still the same after put \clearpage after the table.

the big "Appendience" took up one whole page before the table.

I don't think so. since I tested it with "aaa", those three one char
also show in new page. with table on the following page.

Thanks for your suggestions. I must take care the extra packages going
to use. It's dissertation, involves so many things, a bit worry an
introduction of a new package going to affect other part. so I tried
to keep it as simple as possible.

Message-ID: <CAKiqjsaGe6U3=4-xB5nL+3gbDOiyOiHrAVdZG7oO1A9xS-Qq5A@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings TeXians!

I managed technical documentation for a software company in Finland
2000-2005.  Using a Linux OS, I developed styles and bash compiling
scripts, processing 11 user manual and reference volumes as well as a
range of marketing brochures in LaTeX -- single-source style.

I returned to the US, and after six years managing content and editing
for federal projects using MS Office on Windows, I'm rebuilding a
LaTeX environment on my Macintosh. I recently separated on friendly
terms from a contractor in Fairfax, and I'm taking a short sabbatical,
revisiting my LaTeX and scripting passion and attending seminars on
SharePoint, process improvement, contract management and project
management.

I'm intrigued to think that there may be spaces in the federal
government where LaTeX is useful.  Can you point me toward
opportunities that would take advantage of my comprehensive LaTeX
know-how?

All the very best!

I think that "The Computer Science of TeX and LaTeX" by Victor Eijkhout
is what you need. The announce:

Unfortunately the link there currently gives:

There is a problem with the resource you are looking for, and it cannot be displayed.

(Always check links before posting!)

However, one can find the book with a google for:

The example can be run with iniTeX, plain TeX, LaTeX, e.g.:

tex --ini test
latex test


Also I have written a package `fibnum' that implements an expandable
\fibnum{<n>} where <n> is an integer in the range [-(2^{31}-1), 2^{31}-1].
Until some time after I have managed my bundle update, it's available at
  http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71873949/tex/fibnum.pdf
The file `fibnum.dtx' is embedded as file attachment.
The package `fibnum.sty' is unpacked by plain TeX (or iniTeX, but not LaTeX):
  tex fibnum.dtx

Hi Amoakoh,for learning I would suggest l2short.pdf from
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english. It should give you a
good overview. There are also numerous books, I would suggest the "LaTeX
Companion" by Frank Mittelbach et al.

Converting Word Objects to LaTeX may not be a really nice process, but:

1) Instead of converting to EPS, convert to PDF. pdflatex is more or less
the standard today, with its successors xelatex and lualatex. Unless you
have very special requirements start with pdflatex.

2) Assuming you have various objects drawn in Word I guess you need to
manually copy them and paste them e.g. in Corel Draw or Inkscape from where
you can save them as PDF. I am not aware of an automated way of doing so
from Word (I also don't have any Word here to check it.)

If you have diagrams from Excel: These can be saved in Excel directly to
PDF. It is even easily possible to write a VBA macro which saves all
diagrams from an Excel file to PDF.

Uwe

There is also

  LaTeX: A Document Preparation System, ISBN-13: 978-0201529838

by Lesly Lamport.  It desribes the basics.  The LaTeX Companion only
explains the extensions but not the basics.

IMO, Lamport's book is a very good entry point for beginners.

The only thing it lacks is a pointer to amsmath, which IMO is
essential.  But fortunately we can run

  texdoc amsmath

on the command line nowadays in order to get its documentation.

As far as lshort is concerned, maybe the English version is usable.
All the translations are utterly flawed and out-of-date and should be
avoided.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sadly, that's been pretty much abandoned --- Altsys Virtuoso on NeXTstep was perfect (for my needs). Its successor, Macromedia FreeHand for Mac OS and Windows is still workable, but is not going to be up-dated, and won't work on the latest version of Mac OS X.

If you get Adobe's Creative Suite you can add enough plug-ins to make Adobe Illustrator usable, but it's still needlessly complex.

For opensource programs there are a number of options:

 - Inkscape --- while oriented towards SVG this should be usable for .eps and CMYK

 - Cenon --- originally a CAD/CAM program, it's been opensourced: 

http://www.cenon.info/frame_gb.html

There are others, but Cenon is my general-purpose suggestion --- if you have specific needs, let us know and I'll see if I can think of something better suited to your needs.

I would add Scribus to the list, which runs on most platforms. It's
aimed at high-quality page-layout, but it has enough graphics capability
for most needs, is easy to use, and generates very good vectorised
graphics (pdf or ps). You can point it to your tex fonts and then get
consistent font treatment across your text and graphics. Like other
posters, I use pdflatex and export pdfs from scribus - which I then do a
final crop using pdfcrop.

If you need graphics with variable shadings, fuzzy brushes and the like,
you'll end up in the bitmap graphics world, meaning Adobe photoshop (if
you have the money) or gimp (if you don't). Pdflatex works well with png
graphics - or jpegs if you need to compress and don't mind the loss in
quality.

Good luck.

For that matter, one could add Adobe InDesign --- the problem w/ using a page layout program is the nuisance of opening an extant .eps.

For what?

It's the ``GNU Image Manipulation Program'' (where ``Image'' means pixel map).

A .eps can have text and vector elements in it, neither of which GIMP handles elegantly, nor can it put them into a .eps in a resolution-independent fashion.

Here's an example of the sort of thing which I use a .eps drawing program for:

- Open crossword puzzle and matching template
- paste in styles and colour definitions and text block from template
- select all numbers on the crossword puzzle proper which are between 8.5 and 8.6 pts. in fontsize using the Graphics Find & Replace dialog
- click on the proper paragraph style to assign it, then nudge numbers into place
- select all of the puzzle text and paste into a four-column text block, assign appropriate paragraph style and edit as needed to fit nicely
- name all colours and redefine as black and a 50% tint thereof

GIMP is only useful for such when one is willing to accept flatting out text or vector elements to pixels.

Moreover, Corel's PS code is wretched, hard to trap or post-edit.

Lastly, Corel abandoned Mac OS, so their tools are Windows only.

I don't follow. It doesn't maintain vector to vector graphics?

Inkscape is handy for SVG, which convert to EPS, although I've had some issues
getting the look the way I like it.

The graphics situation in LaTeX is frustrating. For someone who just wants to
include an image without knowing much about them, a word processor is far
simpler. I keep using LaTeX because I'm stubborn, and I don't like word
processors very much.

No, GIMP only emits pixels (that would've been easier to grok if I'd written out ``flattening'' instead of the ``flatting'' typo, my apologies).

which is why I mentioned it w/ a caveat in my initial message in this thread.

If you need to include vector .eps images you may find Cenon or Scribus (mentioned by Steve Schwartz) of use.

I've collected a list of graphics programs.  (Search for the word
'Graphics'.)

I think that Xfig is still one of the best because it allows one to
make precise figures on a grid.  A lot of other programs only allow
freehand drawing which makes exact graphics hard.  I use the xfig
export to eps and then import that into LaTeX all the time.

If you would like some powerful graphics within LaTeX, PSTricks is
quite good - especially if you know a little postscript.

These observations are very important.  I still deal with printers who 
cannot really be trusted with anything but TIFF, and TIFF output is 
better from GIMP than (if it is even possible) from Illustrator.  But 
you have to beware of the resolution trap.  When you import Illustrator 
EPS into GIMP, you have to specify what resolution you want in the basic 
Gimp working copy.  It will default to 72 DPI, and from then on, no 
image scaling will help you.  Depending on the predominant character of 
the image, you really need to decide on something like 300 DPI for 
something that will look all right as a half tone, and 600 or, ideally, 
1200 DPI for something that is going to resemble line art in the final 
inking.  The results eat up the megabytes, but they look pretty good on 
paper.

If only!  Adobe Illustrator is the only thing that still tethers me to 
Windows, and I use the GIMP wherever I can, but GIMP and Illustrator 
have two completely different approaches to the creation of graphics.  
If I start with a Gimped image, I still have to use an old version of 
Streamline to prepare bitmaps for vector drawing when that is what is 
needed.  It is not easy, but it eventually works.  I try out new 
versions of SVG whenever I learn of them, but there are still many 
aspects of vector drawing that SVG cannot produce, (and I leave out all 
the color and blend refinements that I do not understand or need).

I usually do the dvips -> ps2pdf route of making pdfs, as I find it most
consistent. Will dvips handle pdf graphics? I thought I had to use eps.

I suppose it is only old FORTRAN programmers that would like my 
method.  Do it approximately in Inkscape and then edit the SVG 
with emacs.  :-)

If you want to use dvips, then you need eps graphics. Sorry, I got confused
by other posts.

That's correct, I'm really afraid.  Some years ago I asked the same question
and gut no other answer.

My 'solution' looks like this, eg

\pgfdeclarepatternformonly{wide north east lines}{\pgfqpoint{-1pt}{-1pt}}{\pgfqpoint{7pt}{7pt}}{\pgfqpoint{6pt}{6pt}}%
{
  \pgfsetlinewidth{0.4pt}
  \pgfpathmoveto{\pgfqpoint{0pt}{0pt}}
  \pgfpathlineto{\pgfqpoint{6.1pt}{6.1pt}}
  \pgfusepath{stroke}
}

Meaning I have to create a new macro for every new spacing.  Far from being elegant!
 I'm very interested in a more variable solution but not able to realise it.

Best regards,

Juergen

Assuming that you are happy with the Computer Modern fonts,
all you need to do is to make use of (e.g.,) CMBXTI10
(Computer Modern Bold eXended Text Italic 10pt), as in :

	\font \bolditalicfont = cmbxti10
	\bolditalicfont
	This will appear in bold italics
	\end

If you prefer to use system fonts, then XeTeX rather
than TeX will be your engine of choice, whereupon
you could write (for example)

	\font \bolditalicfont = "Palatino Linotype Bold Italic"
	\bolditalicfont
	This will appear in bold italics
	\end

Message-ID: <CABbN1RwbPC2pQ4OPw2V1ExSmdYu3m_-7jLjJ+oYwOzZhV5qQ0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, i'm doing a report and used for the bibliography the archive .bib.
I stated then after


\tableofcontents
\listoffigures
\listoftables

as

\newpage
\bibliography{biblio.bib}
\bibliographystyle{plain}

\end{document}

The problem is that the index generated by \tableofcontents not including
the bibliography (preferably at the end of index), ie. the index only
appoints all but not the bibliography.

How included?

Thanks

This depends on the document class you are using, as the commands for
headings are defined there. Which one are you using?

Subject: [texhax] Mathematics subject classification numbers question
Message-ID: <43784FAD-B3F6-4132-9C84-508ACBF6B08F@earthlink.net>

This has got to be something that's simple to do, but I have spent  
many hours trying to track down exactly how, so far without success.

I am preparing a paper for the Illinois Journal of Mathematics.  It  
instructs authors to include mathematics subject classification  
numbers ``in the usual format.''  The IJM has a sample .tex file for  
an actual paper.  It is in  \documentclass{amsart}, which uses the  
command \subjclass{} for the msc numbers.  This makes the argument   
appear in an unnumbered, unmarked footnote at the bottom of page 1.   
So apparently that's the ``usual format'' for the subject  
classification numbers.

But my paper is in  \documentclass{article} for which there is no  
\subjclass{} command (at least, I got an ``undefined control  
sequence'' error when I tried it).  I have tried \footnote{}, but that  
makes a numbered footnote.  I have also tried \thanks{} within  
\title{} or \author{}.  That also puts a footnote where I want it, but  
marks it (and the title or author's name) with an asterisk.  So how do  
I get an unmarked, unnumbered footnote for the msc numbers at the  
bottom of page 1?

Yes, I could simply change the .tex file for my paper to  
\documentclass{amsart}.  But if I do THAT, it will wreak havoc with  
line breaks in the many inline math mode expressions that appear  
throughout the text.  And my paper is over 30 pages long...

TIA, KF

Make a file w/ the \documentclass{amsart} format and use the command \show\subjclass to see what it is. Continue backtracking as necessary until you arrive at the original definition (or just look through the source for amsart and find it there).

Hi,

When I try to compile my .tex file, that was generated using Sweave in  
R,  and it gets to a \begin{Soutput} it generates a error message:  
LaTeX Error: Undefined color `darkred'.  Why does the compiler think

key and the compiler goes on its merry way till it gets to the next  
\begin{Soutput}.

Any suggestions?  I run TeXShop 2.43 on an iMac running 10.5.8 and R  
2.14.1.

Thanks,

Keith Jones, Ph.D.

Well, that is difficult to say without a minimal example (the smallest 
document you can create that still show the problem). So please post one.

The error might not even be Soutput related.

It seems that your mail was broken somhow because some of the programs
involved didn't recognize the character encoding.  Maybe it's better
to attach a compressed file instead.

Also, you didn't tell us what went wrong.  Did you get any error
message?  Then please post them here.  The log file is also helpful.
And please create a minimal example which only shows the problem.

What I see at a first glance is that you are using T1 font encoding
instead of T2A, which is needed for Russian.  Replace

 \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

with

 \usepackage[T1,T2A]{fontenc}

And finally:

 \usepackage[russian]{babel}

You have to specify specify at least one language here.

You also have to select a font which supports Cyrillic.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I guess that the Soutput environment is using darkred but doesn't
define it itself.  In this case you have to load another package
explicitly.  If true, this should be mentioned somewhere in the Sweave
documentation.  I would look there first.

Subject: [texhax] April 2012 TUG news: Lucida OpenType, TUGboat, bursary,
	conferences
Message-ID: <201204160017.q3G0HPNM017425@freefriends.org>

Dear TeX users,

Spring has come early to many parts of North America, and as you watch
the blossoms or reach for the allergy pills, here's what's going on at
the TeX Users Group.

- We are pleased to be able to offer the Lucida fonts in OpenType
   format. The Type 1 Lucida fonts are frozen and will not be
   developed further, while the OpenType fonts continue to be actively
   maintained and developed. For instance, the OpenType fonts support
   more languages, with a variety of visual improvements to their
   glyphs and spacing. Lucida OpenType is also one of the few font
   sets currently supporting OpenType mathematical typesetting, and
   (uniquely, to our knowledge) provides a bold math variant. The
   regular-weight Lucida OpenType math font includes a newly-designed
   script alphabet design.

- The latest issue of TUGboat has gone to the printer and should be in 
   your hands soon. As always, TUGboat needs your article/review/blurb/
   musing for the next issue. Articles on any aspect of TeX and friends
   are always welcomed.
   http://tug.org/TUGboat/


- Packages for inclusion in TeX Live 2012 should be submitted to CTAN
   soon.  Approximate deadline for inclusion in this year's
   distribution is May 10.
   http://tug.org/texlive/


- The deadline for the bursary to the 2012 annual meeting is approaching.
  You have until April 30 to apply. 
   http://tug.org/bursary/


- Speaking of which, TUG 2012 will be held in Boston, Massachusetts,
   USA, from July 16 through July 18 at the Omni Parker House. The
   registration form, discount code for our group's hotel reservations
   and other information is at:
   http://tug.org/tug2012/


- GUST is celebrating 20 years with a special BachoTeX at the end of April. 
  http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2012
 

- Other upcoming TeX conferences in 2012:
   August 23-26 - TeXperience 2012 (Beskydy, Czech Republic)
   http://katedry.osu.cz/kma/TeXperience2012/

   October 8-12 - EuroTeX 2012 and the Sixth ConTeXt User Meeting

I've asked for a full example, because

http://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/share/texmf/tex/latex/Sweave.sty

does not mention any corlors.

So the problem is either from the Sweave process itself or somewhere 
else in the document

As far as I know Greenland is not a part of Europe (even though they are 
a self governing part of Denmark)

For example in 2007, the Greenland national handball team competed in 
the handball world cup. Qualifying via the panamerican group.

Well, this is fair: people I believe leave Monaco empty (I mean with

The image associated with the command \GreatBritain is the United
Kingdom (of Great Britain _and_ Northern Ireland), not just Great
Britain - so it's a misnaming, rather than an omission.

According to both the Latex book and the companion, \pagebreak0 ought to 
suggest this might be a good place to break.  Instead it does break the 
page and prints a 0.  What is going on?

What I am actually trying to do is to have a bunch of paragraphs, each one 
not broken across a page break, with as much space at the bottom as needed 
to ensure this.  They are each 9 lines long.  What is the easiest way to 
do this?

The number is optional, so \pagebreak[0] should work.

Subject: [texhax] Lulu and CreateSpace formatting
Message-ID: <D97FB1A3-EAEA-4965-9882-62562A2F9D2D@stanford.edu>


Hi all,

I was a heavy LaTeX user in the 1980s and 90s, but since then have made much less use of it as my career changed. I now want to collect together a lot of earlier material and make it available at low cost in the form of print-on-demand books from Lulu and CreateSpace. Everything is in LaTeX 2.0.9, article.sty or book.sty, and my current editing package is Textures on a Mac.

Lulu and CreateSpace accept PDFs (provided the fonts are fully embedded), and provides page size and text area parameters, but little more. Certainly no LaTeX style files -- they do not seem to have any support for TeX. I assume I need to edit the book.sty file to generate PDFs of the required dimensions. But that's beyond anything I ever did before. So I'm looking for someone who could edit my book.sty file (a customized one I was provided for an earlier book project) so the output has the right dimensions for Lulu. I'm willing to pay for this, BTW.

Thanks,

Keith

Subject: [texhax] Virtual Font file format
Message-ID: <SNT114-W2925C7160B98AC4D20FBC7D9230@phx.gbl>





Hello,
I would like to ask where can I find a good documentation on the Virtual Font file format? I've searched the Web with Google but have no luck.
I am writing a DVI driver. Currently, it can convert a DVI to EMF natively, and to  PNG and PDF via the Cairo graphics library. I don't use PK fonts; instead, I used the TFM files and the corresponding PFM/PFB files.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Peter F.

I think the problem may be much easier than what it may appear to be.
Whoever ends up being your print house should have a user's manual
with a list of supported book sizes. Then you can simply use the
{geometry} package. In particular, you put this in the preamble
(before the \begin{document} section):
  \usepackage{geometry}

Then you can specify the dimensions you want as parameters in the
above statement or you can specify them in a separate \geometry
command.

For example, I helped a retired professor republish a book he had
coauthored years ago called "Distributive Lattices". For that book,
the desired size of the new edition was 10 inches by 7 inches. Here is
the geometry command I used:
\geometry{
  xetex,centering,twoside,includehead,nofoot,nomarginpar,
  paper=a4paper,layoutheight=10in,layoutwidth=7in,layouthoffset=16.1mm,layoutvoffset=21.5mm,
  bindingoffset=5mm,
  inner=15mm,outer=15mm,top=20mm,bottom=20mm,           % margins
  headheight=6mm,headsep=12mm,
  %showframe,showcrop
  }

If you publish through Lulu or CreateSpace, you may find that they own
the ISBN number, not you. So you may want to consider purchasing your
own ISBN number through Bowker at
  https://www.myidentifiers.com/

With your own ISBN number and a pdf file with imbedded fonts, you can
publish through Lightning Source:
  http://www.lightningsource.com/

Lightning Source is part of the Ingram Book Company, which includes
Amazon.com. So in the end, you can arrange to have your book show up
on Amazon.com's web site. Here is the "Distributive Lattices" book on
Amazon:
  www.amazon.com/dp/098380110X/

Maybe the first step is to collect all your material and combine it
into a single pdf file with embedded fonts. To check the fonts in your
pdf file, you can use Adobe Acrobat Reader
(File-->Properties-->Fonts). You can also use the pdffonts utility
from
  http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html

AFAIK, this is the definite documentation:

  http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb11-1/tb27knut.pdf

Maybe

  http://ctan.mackichan.com/help/virtual-fonts.knuth

can be read more conveniently on screen.

Fairly certain it was documented by Don Knuth in
a TUGboat article entitled something along the
lines of "Virtual Fonts : More Fun for Grand Wizards"
or somesuch.  Check the TUGboat archives, and if that
fails to provide anything, check with Barbara Beeton.

Hi everyone,

When I try this:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{ntheorem}
\usepackage{thmtools}
\declaretheoremstyle[headfont=\scshape,bodyfont=\itshape,numberwithin=section]{mystyle}
\declaretheorem[style=mystyle]{definition}

\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{blindtext}

\begin{document}


I got this:

! Undefined control sequence.
l.9 \declaretheoremstyle
                        [

My system is Ubuntu 12.04 with texlive, full install.

Thanks a lot!!

Message-ID: <CAFqVdr0Z38HknAX7y+b=W+VaVPavAnPfMNSSkEdDXSckuZDQ3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have implemented a  preprocessor that say convert a filename.tex to
filename.ltx (it puts LTR words, small sentences inside \LRE macro). I want
to automate the process via \write18 so that when a user has filename.tex
and runs pdflatex on filename.tex, then automatically via write18:


   - preprocessor is called and converts filename.tex to filename.ltx
   - pdflatex is run on filename.ltx (pdflatex filename.ltx)
   - deletes filename.ltx when PDF output is produced


What I find impossible is the second one. I can not have a second run of
pdflatex inside the first pdflatex run. Is there any solution to this
problem?

As an example amsmath.sty redefines \eqno and \leqno. Would not it be
better to define new macros rather than redefining existing primitives? and
how one can (if a package already redefines some primitives), restore the
original definition of the primitive? so that a primitive is really a
primitive? as in ams math package, \eqno and \lqno become primitives not
macros?

Never mind, I figured out the stupid error on my part which caused this.

which package version are you using.

Note that the ubuntu packages are hopelessly outdated.

a search of command definitions in the thmtools
package shows that \declaretheoremstyle is
defined in the file  thm-kv.sty  so that is
the one that needs to be updated.  whether the
new version of thm-kv will work comfortably
with the other thmtools files is uncertain, so
perhaps it would be safer (?) to download the
entire thmtools package.

I would recommend installing a new full latex installation. As can be 
seen from your paste, you have not updated all the needed files. Thus 
I'd recommend installing the TUG TeX Live instead. Then YOU decide when 
to update.

PdfTeX has \pdfprimitive that can be used to access the original
definition of any primitive, e.g. \pdfprimitive\eqno. LuaTeX and XeTeX
have it under \primitive name.

Subject: [texhax] Swapping the meaning of _ and \_
Message-ID: <008001cd21a3$5c04d9a0$140e8ce0$@yahoo.com>


Hello,

The context for this question is plain TeX:

Goal:  In my source .tex file and in my own macros, I would like to use _ as
an ordinary character and use \_ for subscripts in math mode.

What I tried:  Following some ideas in David Solomon's The Advanced TeXbook,
I toyed with the idea of starting and ending all my files with the following
blocks of code:

     \chardef\catcount=\catcode`_% store current meaning of _
     \ifnum\catcode`\_=\catcode`A\else%
     \catcode`_=11%
     \fi%

     \catcode`_=\catcount % reset meaning of _

However, the preceding is _not_ a complete solution, for the following
reasons:

1) Using un-escaped _ results in a raised dot -- why doesn't it result in
just the _?

2) Getting a _ with escaped _ is a tad bit more complicated than it used to
be because now TeX needs to know when the control sequence \_ ends.

3) What more needs to be done so that the un-escaped _ results in _?

4) Couldn't figure out how to get subscripts in math mode.

5) I understand that whenever I include anybody else's code, I would need to
change the meaning of _ to its default value before doing the \input.  After
the \input line, I can redefine _ to be what I want it to be.  What I don't
know if the preceding suffices to allow me to use macros from that file, or
if I need to set _ to its default value before using macros from that file
too?  I don't think so, but I am not sure.

So what's a good way to swap the meaning of _ and \_?

Thanks,

--Suresh

It depends on the font encoding, OT1 is awkward, only in the
typewriter family (\tt/\ttfamily) you get the underscore.
This is fixed in T1 encoding, for example.

Save the original \_ in a different macro:

\let\_\underscore

and use \underscore to get a underscore in OT1 with roman/sans serif
families.

> 3) What more needs to be done so that the un-escaped _ results in _?

Use fonts with a different font encoding (e.g. T1) that have
the underscore at the position of the underscore.

> 4) Couldn't figure out how to get subscripts in math mode.

Happily TeX provides primitives for the function of catcodes 7 (^)
and 8 (_): \sp for superscripts and \sb for subscripts.

\let\_\sb

It depends on anybody else's code:
* Some packages don't use _ at all.
* For example, I have tried to make my packages that also support
  plain TeX robust in regard of unusual catcodes. At the beginning
  package pdftexcmds.sty sets the catcode of _ to 12 and at the
  end the previous value is restored.
* For other packages you have indeed to set the catcode of _
  to the standard value before loading the package and can
  restore it afterwards. I think for most packages this will be ok.
* But some packages might use _ as part of there user interfaces,
  that might conflict with your redefinitions.

> So what's a good way to swap the meaning of _ and \_?

One way (untested):

\edef\RestoreCatcodeUnderscore{%
  \def\noexpand\RestoreCatcodeUnderscore{%
    \catcode95=\the\catcode95\relax
    % or \catcode`\noexpand\_=\the\catcode`\_\relax
  }%
}
\RestoreCatcodeUnderscore
% Now macro \RestoreCatcodeUnderscore is available that
% restores the previous catcode of the underscore.

\def\SetCatcodeUnderscore{%
  \catcode95=11 %
}

\let\SavedUnderscore\_
\let\_\sb

% and both can be put together:
\def\RestoreUnderscores{%
  \RestoreCatcodeUnderscore
  \let\_\SavedUnderscore
}
\def\SetUnderscores{%
  \SetCatcodeUnderscore
  \let\_\sb
}

\SetUnderscores

% loading a package
\RestoreUnderscores
\input foo
\SetUnderscores

Yours sincerely

That's fine (but you don't need the percent signs at the end of the lines).

That's what happens to be at the glyph position corresponding to _ in
the current font. Try loading a font that has an underscore at this
position, like cmtt or ecrm.

You should turn _ into an other character (catcode 12) instead, then
the control sequence \_ is unambiguous (like \& etc.).

\let\_\sb

Catcodes are assigned during the input stage, so as long _ has the
expected catcode while loading the file, you should be able to use
macros from that file (except they use \scantokens).

As far as I'm concerned, I've always thought it is a very bad idea to
redefine primitives. Some people do know the meaning of primitives and
do use them that way; as soon as you redefine them, you create a
discrepancy between the way the engine works and the way it is
supposed to work (according to the reference manual, TeXbook, etc.).

It should be used in display math only: $$...\eqno(15)$$

If your call is "pdflatex filename.tex" I can't even see how you do the
first one automatically; could you expand on that?

Anyway, solutions include: changing your call so that it first calls
the preprocessor, then "pdflatex filename.ltx", then deletes the file;
or you can use a master file with an input file:

%%%
\documentclass{whatever}

\usepackage{preprocessor}

\begin{document}
\preprocess{filename.tex}
\end{document}
%%%

where "\preprocess" (defined e.g. in the "preprocessor" package) would
write "filename.ltx", then call "\input filename.ltx" and finally delete
the file.

You can also avoid the master/input files with a call like :

pdflatex --jobname=filename
         \documentclass{whatever}
         \usepackage{preprocessor}
         \begin{document}
         \preprocess{filename.tex}
         \end{document}

If your text editor doesn't let you customize your call to TeX that way,
well, just switch to another one :)

Best,
Paul

IMHO, redefining primitives is a kind of vandalism, that the AMS (and 
AFAIK only the AMS) does all too often.  They "undefined" \over and its 
relatives (\overwithdelimiters,...) on the grounds (I got this explanation 
from the late Michael Downes) that \over as defined caused the engine to 
overwork because it could not know which of the four possible font sizes 
to use until it was finished, hence had to essentially use \mathchoice 
internally.  This may have been a reason in 1990, but is no longer a 
reason today.  A book I published then took about to tex; now it compiles 
in less than a minute.

I was helping a colleague prepare a book for AMS publication and he had 
used \over over and over.  Eventually, by delving deep into amstex, I 
discovered that they had \let\over something else and used that something 
else to define \frac.  So what this was was discipline for the use of some 
future program that would replace tex.  Some of those future programs now 
exist; I wonder whether they have eliminated \over.

Another thing the AMS has done is outlaw the use of the plain \matrix and 
its relatives.  In a book I published in 2002, with the AMS, there were 
dozens of instances of \pmatrix and the book wouldn't compile  under 
amstex. 
I just copied Knuth's original definition into my file.  But this cannot 
be done with primitives.

Bottom line: it is a terrible thing to redefine or undefine primitives.

there have been a lot of comments on
this, generally negative regarding the
desirability of redefining primitives.
i won't try to justify the practice, but
i have uncovered some reasons why it was
done, at least in the case of \eqno and
\leqno.

in amstex, \eqno and \leqno were not
redefined, but the handling of display
numbers was made more complicated by the
built-in handling.  from (not distributed)
documentation for amstex:

  Basically, \tag is supposed to mean \leqno or \eqno, depending on
  whether the flag \iftagsleft@ has been set.  [...]

  \tag has another slight problem, because \eqno and \leqno treat their
  arguments as math formulas, which isn't convenient when - is used as
  a hyphen; normally, it is better to have the argument treated as
  text.  We will allow the argument to be treated both ways, depending
  on the flag \ifmathtags at .  [...]

  [NOTE: TeX puts an \eqno or \leqno on a separate line unless the space
  between the tag and the formula is at least as wide as the tag
  itself, i.e., the formula plus a box twice the width of the tag
  should fit on the line.  By diddling with \tagform@, this rule could
  be changed.  For example, if the rule is that the space between the
  tag and the formula should be at least 1em (seems to be used by
  Cambridge University Press) we could

    \def\tagform@#1{\setbox0\hbox{\rm(\ignorespaces#1\unskip)}%
      \dimen0=\wd0 \advance\dimen0 1em \divide\dimen0 by 2
      \wd0=\dimen0 \box0 }

  Then twice the width of \tagform@{#1} would be the `real' width of
  the tag plus 1em.]

in practice among ams authors, text display
numbers are decidedly more appropriate;
perhaps if knuth had been asked in 1980 to
consider changing the handling of \eqno and
\leqno to text, things might have been
different, but it's too late for that now.

this reformatting of the equation number
as text was carried over into amsmath,
but even more forcefully.  amsmath is
more ambitious than amstex regarding the
formatting of multi-line displays, and
additional checking/changes were required
to accommodate that.  from the comments
in amsmath.dtx:

  Special handling is needed for flush-left equations. We need to
  measure the equation body (found in box 0 after we close it with
  the \egroup). Then after a fairly normal test to see if it fits
  within the available space, we need to consider overlapping into
  the displayindent area if displayindent is nonzero (as in an
  indented list). If there is an equation number we may have to shift
  it by hand to a separate line when there is not enough room;
  we can no longer take advantage of the automatic shifting provided
  by the \leqno, \eqno primitives.

since amsmath.dtx *is* distributed,
and the pdf file is included in tex live
(texdoc -l amsmath  and choose amsmath.pdf),
interested users can read the rest of the
commentary there.

in response to another comment regarding
the change to plain \pmatrix{...} to
\pmatrix ... \endpmatrix in amstex, that
got around problems with the immediate
tokenization of the argument which were
inherent when using the original definition
in complicated situations that knuth hadn't
had to deal with, but started arising when
actual examples drawn from material in ams
publications were attempted.  (this is the
same reason that \begin{...} ... \end{...}
environment syntax is more often used in
latex rather than simple commands with
arguments.)  should the command names have
been changed?  probably, but again,
hindsight is wonderful.

the first run is done by user. Just as you or anyone else from an editor
typeset a document by the means of "pdflatex filename.tex"

This is exactly what I have already said. But it seems impossible that
during one run of pdflatex (the one that user starts initially), you can
have a second pdflatex run.

Usually this is not a problem unless the same jobname is used
in the same directory. In the latter case two processes would
want to write the same files (jobname.log, jobname.pdf, auxiliary files).

Michael, do you really mean amstex or are you talking about amslatex?
As far as LaTeX is concerned, it has its own syntax and thus it's
consequent to disable things which are not part of its specification.

Using non-LaTeX commands in LaTeX often cause a lot of trouble, at
least unless you know _exactly_ what you are doing.

Regards,
  Reinhard

the preceding definitely refers to ams-latex.

\pmatrix et al were redefined in amstex.  this
was then carried over into ams-latex.

    Michael, do you really mean amstex or are you talking about amslatex?
    As far as LaTeX is concerned, it has its own syntax and thus it's
    consequent to disable things which are not part of its specification.

i'm not michael, but i've investigated the
background via the relevant documentation,
some of which isn't public.

    Using non-LaTeX commands in LaTeX often cause a lot of trouble, at
    least unless you know _exactly_ what you are doing.

agreed.
i've already responded regarding the reasons
for changing how \eqno and \leqno behave.

places pdf in the current directory but all other output files in the test

How can you reverse the order of \halign so that

Will mean


\halign{# & # \cr
2&1\cr}


I need to produce a multipage material with \halign.

Subject: [texhax] Auto capitilise first letter of acronym
Message-ID: <CAMjHiDxYr=BzjJVLtmuP45NRz93kNkYF-bbRtMfv7E1+_v-jZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello TeXhax

I'm trying to write a macro that auto capitalise the first letter in
an acronym if the acronym is the first word in a sentence. So far I
have come up with the following macro.

\sfcode`\.=1001\sfcode`\?=1001\sfcode`\!=1001\sfcode`\:=1001
\newcommand{\acr}[1]{\ifnum\spacefactor=1001
\MakeUppercase{\protect\StrLeft{#1}{1}}\textsc{\StrGobbleLeft{#1}{1}}\else
\textsc{#1}\fi}
It uses \StrLeft and \StrGobbleLeft from the xstring package to make
the first letter uppercase and the rest small caps.

MWE:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{xstring}
\sfcode`\.=1001\sfcode`\?=1001\sfcode`\!=1001\sfcode`\:=1001
\newcommand{\acr}[1]{\ifnum\spacefactor=1001
\MakeUppercase{\protect\StrLeft{#1}{1}}\textsc{\StrGobbleLeft{#1}{1}}\else
\textsc{#1}\fi}
\begin{document}
Hello. \acr{gps} is a \acr{gnss}. \acr{glonass} is another \acr{gnss}
\end{document}

The MWE works as expected, the output is "Hello. Gps is a gnss.
Glonass is another gnss" (with some small caps)

I have two problems however, that I can't find a solution for.
1) I get an error if I put \acr{} in the beginning of a paragraph.
! Improper \spacefactor.
\acr #1->\ifnum \spacefactor
                             =1001 \MakeUppercase {\protect \StrLeft {#1}{1}...

2) The macro fails to recognise the beginning of sentences if I use
polyglossia and set the default language to Swedish. Polyglossia and
English works fine. I think this has something to do with
frenchspacing, since the only difference I can find between the two
languages in \PolyglossiaSetup (in polyglossia.dtx) is
"frenchspacing=true" in Swedish. If I enable frenchspacing with the
\frenchspacing command (and omit polyglossia), everything works just
fine.

Does someone know how to fix the above problems?
