Subject: [texhax] TeX Queries 4: Overfull boxes
Message-ID: <50192f75.4867b40a.04bd.5972@mx.google.com>

Hi
extract from TeXbook, chapter 6:

[start quote]
\begindisplay
\hbox spread-1em{You don't get spaces between words narrower than 
this,\ and}\cr
\hbox spread+1.679895em{you don't get spaces between words wider than this.}\cr
\enddisplay
[end quote]

Does the above depend on the size of the font? Presumably the 
physical width of em varies from font to font.

What is a box?
Does it refer to an imaginary box encapsulating the line? What does `\hbox' do?
Anything else the list considers important about overfull boxes?

I'll leave "underfull" for another thread, unless the list considers 
it relevant.

many thanks,
Paul

If memory serves, there's a very good discussion of this in _TeX for the Impatient, which is available in source code form here:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/impatient/

which if you haven't found it yet, may be of interest / use.

>From concepts.tex:

``A \defterm{box}  is a rectangle of material to be typeset.  A single
\refterm{character} is a box by itself,
and an entire page is also a box.
\TeX\ forms a page as a nest of boxes within boxes within boxes. The
outermost box is the page itself, the innermost boxes are mostly
single characters, and single lines are boxes that are
somewhere in the middle.''

This goes back to Paul Isambert's row of bricks analogy, I think.

Subject: [texhax] Lucida Font map problem in MikTeX 2.9
Message-ID: <1343829218.501934e21fa70@webmail.mun.ca>


I am using MikTeX 2.9 + WinEdt7. I am trying to insytall Lucida Fonts that
I purchaesed from Y&Y long back. I created a local directory containing all the
Lucida .pfb, .tfm font files, and have added it to the Roots of MikTeX2.9 by
using
     Maintenance-> Setting-> Roots
     and updated the FNDB.  
When I pdfLaTeX a file containing Lucida fonts, LaTeX processes it correctly,
but by creating the pk fonts (instead of using Type 1 Lucida fonts).  
I feel it is not reading the lucida.map file, and uses bitmapped fonts.
I downloaded the file "lucida.map" from CTAN.
Where should it be placed  in my local (or home) directory, 
so that MikTeX can locate it before I use the following commands

    initexmf --edit-config-file updmap
    and add  
    'Map lucida.map'
    and run  
    initexmf --mkmaps

Any help will be appreciated.

Could you provide examples of where `\vphantom' and `\hphantom' could be used?
I can only picture two dimensions on the page, height and width, 
where does the depth fit into this?
Finally, where would smash be used?

Many thanks,

I use them when I need a space which matches an existing element on a page, or when preparing a student's edition from an instructor's edition (have a command which typesets the answer for the instructor's edition, but for the students' edition, it sets the answer in an hphantom macro so that instead, an empty space for the student to write the answer is placed).

> I can only picture two dimensions on the page, height and width, where does the depth fit into this?

Depth is how far a character or a box descends below the baseline.

Letterforms of varying shapes are arranged in a line from an origin point. The line is the baseline, and the origin point defines where the baseline falls. For lowercase / miniscule letterforms:

 - some range from baseline to x-height: aceijmnorsuvwxz
 - some have ascenders which continue above the x-height: bdfhklt 
 - lastly some have descenders which be below the baseline: gpqy

It's that last group (more-or-less) which forces the need for depth.

> Finally, where would smash be used?

To typeset something w/o taking its height into consideration.

Some typefaces will have em-squares (spatial canvas on which a font is designed) which are different from others, so if set on a line w/ another typeface will have a taller cap-height and will push the baseline down when set on the same line (Agfa Mathematical Pi is particularly egregious for this), so if one wants such special chars in a line w/ other text w/o disturbing the placement of the baseline one would \smash them.

\overline sets a horizontal rule over an element in math mode which has some meaning which I'm unfortunately ignorant of. It's a good example of that class of commands which create elements as vector shapes which will not be visible to a screen reader.

It's a description, but not a good one, IMHO.  There
are no rectangle, only a "virtual" rectangle that
notionally surrounds the material that it contains.
Of course, it need not actually surround it, since
there exist TeX primitives for forcing some or all
of the material to lie outside of the box. I was
going to try to answer Paul' questions myself, and
I still hope to just as soon as I can.

I will yield the floor to Philip on this, will note that ``very good discussion'' meant that it was suited to my needs, and look forward to reading his explanation and deepening my understanding of TeX.

Height and depth are both on the same axis in this two-dimensional space.
Height denotes the part from baseline upwards, depth the part from baseline
downwards.

Hope that helps,

The size of the letter 'M' (the source of the term "em") does vary
from font to font. But the dimension known as an em is defined to be
the "size" of the font. E.g., whether the font is 12 pt Times Extended
or 12 pt Times Condensed, an em is 12 pt long; for 18pt CM, the em is
18 pt long; etc., etc.

That's not to say that the character called the "em dash" will be
exactly 1 em long; font designers can play all sorts of typographical
games. But TeX, when given lengths measured in ems, will use the size
of the font.

The map file should go in the local directory you created in

Subject: [texhax] hyperref problem
Message-ID: <FD789165-4DF2-4E82-8DD7-91D70367976F@tufts.edu>

As part of a large book project, I am using hyperref on the pdf version of output.  There are many index entries which have compiled with no problem, but all of a sudden one set of index entries is returning an error message.  I have extracted what I hope is an illustrative minimal example.
**********************************************************************
%!TEX TS-program =  latex
\documentclass[11pt]{book}
\usepackage{makeidx}
\usepackage[colorlinks, backref]{hyperref}
\makeindex

\newcommand{\resp}[1]{(\textit{resp}. #1)}

\newcommand{\deffont}[1]{\textbf{#1}}%
\ifIndexDefs
\renewcommand{\deffont}[1]{\textbf{#1}\index{#1}}
\fi

\newcommand{\deffontcustom}[2]{\textbf{#1}\index{#2}}


\begin{document}

These are the \deffont{intercepts}.
The intervals between the intercepts are called the \deffontcustom{axes}{axis|of ellipse} of this ellipse;
the larger \resp{smaller}  is called the \deffontcustom{major axis}{axis|of ellipse|major}
\resp{\deffontcustom{minor axis}{axis|minor|of ellipse}}; thus the larger of $a$ and $b$ is the
\deffontcustom{semi-major axis}{axis  | semi-major | of ellipse} while the smaller is the \deffontcustom{semi-minor axis}{axis | semi-minor | of ellipse}.


\printindex

\end{document}
*****************************************************************************************************

I must admit at this point I don't understand the function of the definition of \deffont followed by \ifIndexDefs and a \renewcommand; there is an "undefined control sequence" error connected with the \ifIndexDefs line, but I don't think this is the problem.  But I get the error messages

./Hyperreftest.ind:3: Undefined control sequence.

l.3   \item axis, \hyperindexformat{\minor}{1}

?

If I ignore them, everything appears to compile OK.

I looked into the .ind file (even for the large project) and these entries are the only ones that seem to generate a
"\hyperindexformat" entry;  all others create subitems.

What is going on, and what can I do to stop it?

I've attached the .tex, .ind, .console, and .pdf files--in fact, all the files generated by this process.

Yes, it "depends", but it all depends on what you mean by "depends".
The dimensions of the box will vary with the font size; the effects
that DEK is describing will not.

Yes, the "imaginary" is the key; it exists as a TeX data
structure, but the resulting DVI does not (as far as I can
recall) contain boxes; I believe that it contains only the
contents of boxes (but I would be very happy to be corrected
here).

> What does `\hbox' do?

An \hbox is a horizontal box; it contains things that are stacked
horizontally; a \vbox is a vertical box : it contains things that
are stacked vertically.

> Anything else the list considers important about overfull boxes?

They almost always indicate an error (in thinking, or in
coding, or in allowing for boundary conditions, or whatever)
but not always; and they can generate horrible black solid
boxes (real boxes, at least as far as ink or toner can make
a real box) when they occur in typeset lines.

An underfull box will usually contain more white space than
is optimal for the size of the box and the size of the contents.
(perhaps "will always contain" : I'd need to think about this).
How the space is distributed is very much a function of the
contents of the box.  And of course the "white space" is virtual
white space : a gap will be left in the corresponding typeset
output, which will then be filled with the default background
colour for that region.

Please read the documentation of makeindex and learn about the
specials characters there. As default `|' is configured as
encap, therefore the name after it is treated as macro name.
The level char is available as '!':
  {axis!minor!of ellipse}
  {axis!semi-major!of ellipse}

Not always :


\font \xviiirm = cmr10 at 18 true pt
\xviiirm
\dimen 0 = 1 em
\message {1 em = \the \dimen 0 }
\end

(./untitled-1.tex 1 em = 18.00005pt )


\font \xviiirm = cmtt10 at 18 true pt
\xviiirm
\dimen 0 = 1 em
\message {1 em = \the \dimen 0 }
\end

(./untitled-1.tex 1 em = 18.89983pt )

I stand corrected. But?

What's going on with the example you gave? Why is this so?

Without doing any research (always a bad idea : I am usually
proved wrong) I would postulate that when I specify (e.g.,)

	\font \xviiirm = cmr10 at 18 true pt

I am specifying (in a very notional sense) the /height/ of
the font (which is why one so frequently sees font sizes paired
with leading, as in 10/12 pt Times Roman.).  However, when
I ask for the size of the em unit in the current font, I am
asking for a width.  Unless the font is square, the two
dimensions are unlikely to be the same, and the more the
font is extended or compressed, the less likely it is that
width and height will be close to each other.  This
argument fails for CSS, but there the authors have deliberately
chosen to place expedience over typographic history; fortunately
Knuth was more respectful of the traditions and usages of
countless generations of typographers and typesetters.

An overfull \hbox actually means that material is printed into the
margin.  In most cases this happens if words cannot be hyphenated.
Though TeX's paragraph formatting algorithm does a very good job in
order to avoid such problems (by trying other breakpoints), there is
not much freedom at the beginning of a paragraph.

In some cases overlong lines cannot be avoided, for instance in
fragments of computer code where the original linebreaks have to be
preserved.

The black boxes which are appended to overfull lines are a feature of
TeX.  The plain TeX format sets \overfullrule=5pt just to indicate
overlong lines visually.  Hence, Phil, they look horrible on purpose. 

If in the final document some overfull \hbox'es are unavoidable, one
can set \overfullrule=0pt and the black boxes will disappear (default
in LaTeX, unfortunately).  However, it's better to increase the value
of \hsize temporarily when computer code is typeset.  This allows to
write into the margin but you'll be warned if the increased value is
exceeded.

Didn't you write a TUGboat article about all these things (fine-tuning
TeX documents in order to avoid overfull boxes) many years ago?

Since TeX is not aware of background colours (or colours in general),
it only leaves a gap (interword glue, in TeX parlance).  It doesn't
fill anything with colours.

Backgrounds (either coloured rectangles or pictures) can be inserted
by PostScript or PDF backends via \special or \pdfliteral.  They have
to be inserted immediately after a pagebreak and before anything is
typeset.  It's usually required to hook into the output routine.  

But because TeX passes such instructions literally to backends or
post-processors, all these wonderful things happen behind its back.

  Reinhard

The example is extremely specific and ad-hoc.

The default inter-word space with the cmr10 font has a stretch of 1.66666 pt
and a shrink of 1.111111 pt.  The em size for cmr10 is 10 pt, so the interword
shrink is 0.1111111 or one ninth of an em.  Knuth chose his words so there
were nine spaces on the line that is forced to shrink by 1 em.  

The second line is trickier and somewhat of a lie as well.  Whereas the
limit on shrinking is absolute, there is no actual limit on the amount
of stretching.  The logic of Knuth's sample goes like this:  Plain TeX
has a \tolerance parameter of just 200, and lines with badness 200 (at
the limit of tolerance) have a stretch ratio of $(200/100)^{1/3} = 1.26$ 
(the cube root of 2).  Each of the eight spaces in the sample must stretch
by $1.26 \times 0.166666 em$ for a total stretch of 1.68 em for the line.

The lie is that, with forced breaks due to penalties, some lines may
indeed stretch more than the tolerance would normally allow.

> What is a box?

It is the conceptual building block and container TeX uses.  It is described
in a chapter of the TeXbook.  Each character has its own "bounding box";  lists
of characters and spaces etc form a "horizontal list" which is contained in
a "hbox".  Lists of hboxes and line-spaces plus other stuff form a "vertical
list" which is contained in a vbox.

In a math construction we were using \overline to mark the closure of a 
set. As in \overline{X}, but would sometimes write \overline{X}^2, and 
because of the added height of the overline, the ^2 would disturb the 
spacing bewteen lines. Out solution, the following macro

\newcommand\closure[1]{\smash{\overline{#1}}\vphantom{#1}}

that is we typeset the overlines argument using smash to remove the 
height and depth of it, and then reintroduce the original height of the 
arg using \vphantom

\hphantom could be used within a large math expression where one would 
like to indent a broken formula to within a starting fence on the line 
before, something like

=\hphantom{ \sum_{i=1}^\infty \Bigl[ } ....

that is the sort of thing I use it for.

\smash is especially use when finishing manuscripts and I happen to find 
lines that are separated a bit too much.

Is that not something of an oversimplification, Reinhard ?
Is that not the case only when the box in question is
a line box ?  In Knuth's example, cited by Paul, it is
an explicit \hbox and not a line box, and I would therefore
be /very/ surprised if it caused any material to be printed
in the margin.  Indeed, since we don't know from Knuth's
examples the final disposition of the \hboxen, we do not
know whether they will cause anything to be printed at all.

Surely, if one must descend to such hacks, one should increase \hfuzz,
not \hsize ?

I did, and later Frank Mittelback shewed that it was overkill, and
there was a far simpler way to achieve my goal; but I still remember
and use my method, and have possibly never tried Frank's !

Hence my use of the passive voice : "which will then be filled", and
not the active "which TeX will then fill".  My point was to help
Paul to appreciate that what I had been calling "white space" is
neither explicit nor necessarily white.

Because the em value of cmr10 is 10.00002pt and 10.00002pt*1.8=
18.000036pt. 

And the em value of cmtt10 is 10.4999pt and 10.4999pt* 1,8 =
18.89982pt . 

The rest are rounding errors.

Hi Arno,

you are right here but we can give you a few hints anyway:

a) It is quite helpful if you have someone around who can "just have a
look" It is ofter more easier to show the real problem before posting it.
Well, if you have no LaTeX guy around, feel free to ask.

a*) When you ask here consider preparing a MWE, a minimal working example
showing the problem (http://www.minimalbeispiel.de/mini-en.html) It's
easier to help if we do not need to scan 20 pages of your paper ;-)

b) There is a lot of good documentation out there, so tell us: Where are
you from, which languages can you read and what are you using LaTeX for?
Some letters only or are you preparing your phd thesis in physics? Maybe we
can recommend some good documentation.

c) What is the general headache about? Where are your main issues with
LaTeX?

Happy TeXing!


Uwe

d) Are you familiar with any other "markup language"?

If you don't know what a markup language is, that's fine.  Some

Thank you for your answer.

I came to Latex via R-project and R sweave. I am not a computer guy but
a trader, so my knowledges in markup language are near zero.As a Arch
Linux user, I still have some understandings about codes in general.

For now I am training on short reports, like rewriting my CV or writing
weekly statement for an hedge-fund (weekly perf with ratios and
comments). BUT my final goal, very ambitious, is to be able to mix R and
latex in order to build automated reportings. As you can see, the way is
very long.

I have a long experience of mailing lists/forums, so I think I know how
to post in a correct manner.

Hopefully, on an IRC channel, I found a Latex guy which can maybe reply
to short questions.
As for the doc on internet, I found sssooo mmmaaannnyyy that I can't
even know which one to choose!

For now, I will keep trying to understand what I write and maybe come
here sometimes for more precise answers.

Regards.

Arno,

I can help you to set up your system. In the worst case there is always
Teamviewer. Sweave/R/LaTeX is a nice toolchain that I am quite familiar
with. We could also try knitR, a new player in this field  I haven't had a
chance to play with yet.

Uwe,

thank you so much for your proposal. I will cetainly one day come to you
and get some help.
For now, I need to practice more my Latex. My set up is Texlive+Texmaker
on a Linux box. Then, I need a litle more work on the R side, even if I
feel a litle bit more comfortable writing small scripts with R to deal
with data frames.
I have the ambitious (maybe too) to sell to small/medium hedge fund
automated reports in high quality (not the kind made with a mix of Excel
and Word). I will need many months to set up this activity, if I manage
to achieve it.

I am happy to see I can rely on some support. This is this kind of help
which made me a Linux, R lover. Even if a newby, with work + help from
the community, you can do it.

Best regards.

This is the first time I've seen an Ars Technica article on a

There are a few comments, a lot seem to indicate the font still

the article or comments (that I can see, but no coffee yet today 
either).

The bad kerning is probably from applications not supporting OpenType
style kerning (I see Word and LibreOffice mentioned, and both definitely
don't, not by default at least), shouldn't be an issue for XeTeX or
LuaTeX.

Subject: [texhax] macro expansion trouble
Message-ID: <87txwilpes.wl%neal@walfield.org>

Hello,

I have written a program that does some data processing and then
generates a plot using pgfplots.  I want to include the plot from a
LaTeX document, but I don't want to embed parts of my document in my
data analysis program, such as, how wide the plot should be.

I decided to add a hook (in this case, called \Arg) to the generated
plot, which I could set from my document:

  \begin{axis}[\Arg]
    \addplot[only marks, mark=o] coordinates {
      (3.000000, 1469.000000)
       (4.000000, 461.000000)
    };
  \end{axis}

And then define a macro that sets the hook variable and \input's the
plot commands:

  \newcommand{\includepgfplot}[2][]{{\def\Arg{#1}\input{#2}}}

In my document, I use the macro as follows:

  \begin{tikzpicture}
  \includepgfplot[width=0.5\textwidth]{/tmp/plot}
  \end{tikzpicture}

When I process this with LaTeX, I get the following error:

  ! Missing \endcsname inserted.
  <to be read again> 
                     \textwidth 
  l.1 \begin{axis}[\Arg]
                        
  ? 

The generated pdf is actually correct (when I use \nonstopmode to
ignore errors), but I want to figure out what the problem is.  The
following is a minimal working example:

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{pgfplots} 
  
  \newcommand{\includepgfplot}[2][]{{\def\Arg{#1}\input{#2}}}
  
  \begin{document}
  
  \begin{tikzpicture}
  \includepgfplot[width=0.5\textwidth]{/tmp/plot}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  
  \end{document}

To process the example, use pdflatex and save the above plot data
(from \begin{axis} to \end{axis}) as /tmp/plot.tex.

Any ideas what I am doing wrong?

Thanks,

Neal

Here is an even more minimal example (no need for \input):

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{pgfplots} 

  \begin{document}

  \def\Arg{width=0.5\textwidth}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[\Arg]
    \addplot[only marks, mark=o] coordinates {
      (3.000000, 1469.000000)
       (4.000000, 461.000000)
    };
  \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}

  \end{document}

Note: I only get the error if \Arg includes a control sequence.
Doing:

  \def\Arg{width=5in}

works and does not generate an error.

Usually the key value parser wants to see the equal sign directly:

\def\Arg{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{axis}[width=\Arg]

Or the optional argument can be expanded first:

\def\Arg{0.5\textwidth}
\expandafter\begin\expandafter{%
\expandafter a\expandafter x\expandafter i\expandafter s%
\expandafter}\expandafter[\Arg]

or 

\def\Arg{0.5\textwidth}

\begingroup\edef\next{\endgroup
  \noexpand\begin{axis}[\Arg]%
}\next

Yours sincerely

Hi Heiko,

Thanks for your helpful and quick response!  I opted for the following
solution, which I think is more readable, because it avoids the long
chain of expandafters:

  \def\BeginAxis{\begin{axis}}
  \expandafter\BeginAxis\expandafter[\Arg]

Thanks,

Neal

I've just installed latex2rtf [Mac]. I'm eager to see if it will work for me.

On my first attempt, when I did 'latex2rtf filename' I got '(Not set):1   Cannot open filename.' 

What else do I need to do?

Not a direct answer to your question but I use Pandoc for translating
Latex into another format: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/.  It
works well enough and it is actively developed.

Thanks, Chris. I've been aware of Pandoc for a while. And it has been suggested in this context. 

Maybe I should give the suggestions a try? 

I will.

Dear All,

I have updated the hyperref bundle so that I now have hyper ref v6.82v, an update from v6.82q.  The update is dated 2012/07/29.  Part of this update has seen nameref.sty updated.  In particular, the function \strip at period from nameref.sty has been (slightly) redefined and and, importantly, renamed \NR at strip@period.  So now the hyperref specific code in subfig.sty no longer works, as \strip at period is now undefined.  Specifically, I now get the following error message when compiling a file that has not had this problem before:

! Undefined control sequence.
<recently read> \strip at period

l.1732 ...degraphics{PowerSESDGM2}\label{fig:pc5}}

For my current purposes I can workaround the problem by reverting to the older version of hyperref.  However, this doesn't seem to be a great longer term solution and ideally it would be better to find a patch for subfig.  There is a second complication that arises, this paper is co-authored with someone whose tex installation won't be updated any time soon and so any solution that I find has to be aware of the version of nameref.sty that will actually be loaded and react accordingly.  I have tried something like to following, to appear in the preamble after both subfig and then hyperref have been loaded:*

\makeatletter
   \AtBeginDocument{\@ifpackagelater{nameref}{2012/07/28}{\def\strip at period#1.\relax#2\@nil{#1}}{\relax}}
\makeatother

This throws a different error, namely:

! Argument of \strip at period has an extra }.
<inserted text>
                \par
l.1732 ...degraphics{PowerSESDGM2}\label{fig:pc5}}

My knowledge of TeX is proving insufficient to see what is wrong here.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers, Chris.

* This is the original definition of \strip at period.  I have also tried to give the definition of \NR at strip@period but the outcome is pretty much the same.

This isn't direct answer to your question, but I recommend to read the
following thread on texlive ML:
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2012-August/032046.html

May be it help you find another workaround.

Correct analysis. But in the meantime \strip at period is defined
again (only for subfig) in nameref.

Current version of nameref: 2012/07/31 v2.42
(and hyperref 2012/08/03 v6.82y).

Can anyone suggest a working command line for using pandoc
to convert one of the standard example LaTeX files,
"small2e.tex" or "sample2e.tex" to html?

Thanks.

A quick google:
pandoc command line

gave with the very first link:

http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html

which seems to be what you want.  Very nice!  I haven't tried it.

Yes, I saw that.

It's not working for me.

E.g., with

  pandoc -t html `kpsewhich small2e.tex`

the output in a utf-8 terminal is:

<div id="simple-text"
><h1
  >Simple Text</h1
  ><p
  >Words are separated by one or more spaces. Paragraphs are
  >separated by one or more blank lines. The output is not

No, I meant the transition to other package.

The actual problem is that 1) `subfig' package is now not actively
maintained but there is a recommend replacement and 2) the use of
`internal' macro, there is no guarantee that some `internal' macro will
stay "forever", except LaTeX2e ones.

So again, if package doesn't actively maintained and there is
alternative I would suggest to switch to new package; esp. if that
package uses `internal' macro of other, actively maintained package.

Hi Bill,

I ran pandoc on haskell cabal compiled version and what you need to do is put in this:

pandoc --standalone --to=html --from=latex /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/sample2e.tex

Note the --standalone option.  This will wrap it in a full html file.

I hope this helps.

Chris

I guess that's not the whole story.

This sounds to me as if there's a problem with text encoding. Looks like
pandoc expects utf8, but the input probably is in some other encoding.

Hope this helps,

Correct.

"sample2e.tex" is an ascii file.

I think the following distills the issue:

  : echo "He said, ``No'', and then he left." | pandoc --from=latex --to=html

    STDOUT:
    <p
    >He said, No

    STDERR:
    pandoc: <stdout>: commitAndReleaseBuffer: invalid argument
    (Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character)

It seems that pandoc is tripping on the LaTeX markup for
double quotes.  It also seems to trip on forced linebreaks
indicated by "\\".

My guess, without looking at any code, is that pandoc
supports only a very rudimentary subset of LaTeX markup
for translation to html.

Hi Guys,

This was not my experience at all.  I ran that and resolves fine on my
machine (Ubuntu 12.04).  I am running pandoc 1.9.4.2 which I complied
with cabal so I am not using the Ubuntu package. Also, I have run it
successfully on much more complex documents with success in the past.

Unfortunately, this is a "works on my machine" moment :(

Stop. Now we might be mixing problems...

You are using the command line here, which means it will first be
interpreted by bash (or whatever command line interpreter you use) before
even echo and then pandoc is called. You use double quotes, which tell bash
to look inside and expand there aswell. This means, it will try to call the
command between backquotes ` and `, and substitute the result at its place.
And it will read \\ as an escaped backslash.

You would have to call it like that:

echo "He said, \`\`No'', and then he left." | pandoc --from=latex --to=html

(You can test the echo command first to make sure the output is valid TeX
code, then append the pipe to pandoc.)

Hope that helps,

	Susan

Hi,

1) You can use htlatex for convert tex to html then? open in doc.
2) use LaTeXML (http://packages.debian.org/sid/latexml).

Subject: [texhax] Need help to generate e-book
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1208110905561.28338@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

I am trying to generate a file appropriate for loading on an e-book. 
There is some front matter but the main body consists in using pdfpages to 
load a book that I scanned into a pdf file.  The main thing I want to so 
is get rid of the margins, since margins are not needed (and, more 
importantly, not wanted) in an e-book.  The pdfpages manual has this 
paragraph:

Especially the ?trim? and ?clip? options of \includegraphics are quite 
useful, if only parts of a page should be inserted. (Maybe to cut off the 
header and footer of the inserted pages.) Just use the ?trim? and ?clip? 
options as if they were options of \includepdf. They will be passed to 
\includegraphics internally.

The manual for the graphics package says nothing about a "trim" or "clip" 
options.  What it has is:

\includegraphics *[hllx,llyi][hurx,uryi]{hfilei} Include a graphics file. 
If * is present, then the graphic is ?clipped? to the size specified. If * 
is omitted, then any part of the graphic that is outside the specified 
?bounding box? will over- print the surrounding text.

The pdfpages manual says that any extra parameters will be passed on to 
the \includegraphics macro.  With no samples of how to do this, I tried:

\includepdf[pages=-]{freydpages.pdf}*[3.5in,5.5in][1.5in,1.5in]

but as far as I can tell, it has no effect.  I did try playing with the 
geometry parameters, but if reduce them below:

\usepackage[papersize={4.0in,6.0in},top=0in,bottom=0in,
left=0in,right=0in]{geometry}

the only effect is to shrink the text, which is obviously not the effect I 
am trying to achieve, but I cannot reduce the margins below about 1/2 
inch.

What I am trying to do, obviously, is to make the text as large as 
possible to fit into an e-reader page.  I don't actually own an e-reader 
(I am waiting for the market to shake out) but a friend has a Kobo that 
turns a pdf file sideways, but still has it in rather small size, 
difficult to read with my 75 year old eyes.

Is there a way to do what I want?

Michael

Message-ID: <CAHRhsBqBps8h41YMh9Dp1KH=wcHGNPTMZKDJR0bnmXkY37qV3w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
I am facing a problem with the use of list command. I need to generate
lists with specific numbering systems and then cross-reference them in
different parts.
By using the list command I am able to create lists with the correct system
of numbering. However when I use the \ref command to refer back to them it
only prints the Arabic numeral equivalent of the entry instead of the
numbering system I have used. Is there any way I could resolve this so that
I could get the correct cross-reference inserted.

To illustrate my problem I have written a short code for this which states
my problem too.

---------------------------------------------

\documentclass[12pts,a4paper]{report}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{color}

\newcounter{sections}
\newcounter{sub-section}
\newcounter{clause}
\newcounter{sub-clause}
%this is the counter command




\title{Problem with cross-referencing using list command}

\author{Shubho Roy}

\begin{document}
\maketitle


\begin{list}{(\arabic{sub-section})}{\usecounter{sub-section}}
\item This is some text in sub-section which is using Arabic
  numerals. \label{sub-sec:arabic_numerals}
\begin{list}{(\alph{clause})}{\usecounter{clause}}
\item This is a clause which is using alphabetical numbering
\label{clause:alphabetical}
\begin{list}{(\roman{sub-clause})}{\usecounter{sub-clause}}
\item This is a sub-clause using roman numbering.
\label{sub-clause:roman_numerals}
\end{list}

\end{list}

\end{list}

The problem arising when I use label to reference to different parts
of the document.

\begin{itemize}
\item If I refer to the sub-section using the ref command I get a correct
reference like this: \ref{sub-sec:arabic_numerals}

\item However when I refer to the clause list which is a nested list and
uses alphabetical numbering I still get Arabic numbering as reference:
\ref{clause:alphabetical}. I would like this to be (a)

\item The same problem is available in the case of sub-clause list where I
should get roman numerals but I still get the Arabic numeral:
\ref{sub-clause:roman_numerals}. I would like this to be (i)

\end{itemize}

The hyperref command sends it to the correct link but the numbering
printed is always in Arabic while I have  used other numbering systems
for this.
Any help!!

You should put more trust in the pdfpages manual. It doesn't mention
trim and clip without reason.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\begin{document}  
\includepdf[clip,trim=4cm 6cm 4cm 6cm,fitpaper]{testinput}
\end{document}

(trim starts left and goes counterclockwise.)

It is not a question of trust.  It is a question of knowing how to do it. 
I have examined both the pdfpages and graphics manual and neither of them 
tells how to do it.  With your help, I was finally able to get it working. 
But I don't see how I could have known.

Thank you, Michael

It is a question of trust: As simple google search for
"includegraphics trim clip" gives quite a lot hits which shows the
syntax. But you naturally must do the search.

On my system (miktex 2.9) both graphicx.pdf and grfguide.pdf mention
trim + clip.

That's true, but I can understand how Michael came to this problem. If the
pdfpages documentation really mentioned graphics (and not graphicx), then
he probably just looked at the wrong place for the clip and trim syntax.

Subject: [texhax] recursive \defs
Message-ID: <87r4r7jdsk.wl%neal@walfield.org>

Hi,

I have a large \def that takes some parameters.  I want to define a
convenience macro, which I use from my outer definition, and which
also takes parameters.  Consider:

  \documentclass{article}
  
  \begin{document}
  
  \def\foo#1{%
    \def\bar#1{%
      xxx #1 yyy%
    }%
    \bar{aaa #1 bbb}%
  }
  
  \foo{!}
  
  \end{document}

When I compile this, I get:

  ! Use of \bar doesn't match its definition.
  \foo #1->\def \bar #1{xxx #1 yyy}\bar {
                                         aaa #1 bbb}
  l.12 \foo{!}
            
This is because the #1 in the \bar definition is expanded to the value
of the argument passed to \foo.  How do I escape the #1 in bar's
definition?  What are good approaches to do this type of thing?

You have to double the # in the nested definition:

\def\foo#1{%
  \def\bar##1{%
    xxx ##1 yyy%
  }%
  \bar{aaa #1 bbb}%
}

Otherwise #1 is replaced by the outside argument:

\foo{!} -> \def\bar!{xxx ! yyy}\bar{aaa ! bbb}

Read the TeXbook : you will really enjoy it, and learn a great deal !

 > How do I escape the #1 in bar's definition ?

Use ##1, ##2, etc., within \bar if they are local to \bar;
if you want to refer to \foo's parameters, just use #1, #2, etc.
If you nest three levels deep, use ####1, ####2, etc.

In the body of a definition (its replacement text), to denote a #, you
should double it: ##. So, in your case the definition is:

  \def\foo#1{%
    \def\bar##1{%
      xxx ##1 yyy%
      }%
    \bar{aaa #1 bbb}%
  }

If \bar iself defined another macro with parameter text, the latter
should use four #'s per argument, and so on.

Best,
Paul

Message-ID: <8E15C2BC0B63AD4AA20BF9F1C3947FC13DFF26F9@SMCEXMBX02.mikenet.smcvt.edu>

Last month I got help on this list with a question about installing a font http://www.tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2012-July/019386.html .  
I run Ubuntu Linux and the issue was that I used the tex that I got from the Ubuntu package system and one of the good pieces of advice 
that I got was to also install the TeX Live from tug.org and the two would not interact -- the newer second one would just sit in front of the 
first one that I already had and shadow it (so, for instance I could install AUCTeX via Ubuntu's system and the dependence would be 
satisfied).

I've been working on stuff that needed TeX and so haven't had a chance to fool with my setup.  Now I've had that chance and wanted to
report a small FYI, a word to the wise, for a person who later finds the above advice via a search engine.  The situation is a bit uglier.

Ubuntu doesn't want you to use a root account so you typically running texhax via sudo.  
  ftpmaint at millstone:~$ sudo texhash
  [sudo] password for ftpmaint: 
  texhash: Updating /usr/local/share/texmf/ls-R... 
  texhash: Updating /var/lib/texmf/ls-R-TEXMFMAIN... 
  texhash: Updating /var/lib/texmf/ls-R-TEXLIVE... 
  texhash: Updating /var/lib/texmf/ls-R... 
  texhash: Done.
After a lot of confusion about why kpsewhich wouldn't report my new files, I finally noticed the gotcha in the above: sudo does 
not use the PATH. 
  ftpmaint at millstone:~$ echo $PATH
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux:/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
  ftpmaint at millstone:~$ echo 'echo $PATH' | sudo sh
  /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
The Ubuntu package system puts things in /usr/bin and so texhash was using that one rather than the one I just installed from tug.org.
  ftpmaint at millstone:~$ which texhash
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux/texhash
  ftpmaint at millstone:~$ sudo which texhash
  /usr/bin/texhash

I ran texhash by hand and it worked fine.
  ftpmaint at millstone:~$ sudo /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux/texhash
  texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/ls-R...

That is standard I guess, the root user is not using the same PATH as 
the regular users.

On my systems I have a specific LaTeX user who owns the LaTeX 
installation, thus I do not have to run anything as root. I think this 
provide a better security.

I understand that it varies between Linux distributions.  But Ubuntu is popular and so many people may see the behavior.

That sounds reasonable to me.  What is involved besides creating the user and chown-ing the subdirectory tree?  
You must need to run texhash as "sudo -ulatexuser texhash".  Anything else?  Any special settings for PATH or EDITOR
for that user?  Any executables that need to be suid?  Do you need to set the stuff to have the latexuser group also?
Any other stuff that need to be that user (for instance, asymptote?)?

I have an area on an NFS share (at work) and just a separate partition 
on my Ubuntu at home, say /opt/texlive

/opt/texlive

is owned by the regular user 'latex' with the regular group 'latex' 
(though the group does not seem relevant in this case)

In /opt/texlive I have the structure

...
2010
2011
2012
current -> 2012

i.e. the 'current' is a softlink (handy later)

2012 is the current TUG TL12 installation, installed by the latex user

All files in the 2012 have the permissions set by the installer, thus 
they are readable by everyone, but only changable by the latex user

I've changed the PATH setting in /etc/environment to be something like
 
PATH="/opt/texlive/current/bin/i386-linux:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games"

i.e. to update to 2013, I just move the softlink

Then all 'regular' users have the current TL in their PATH and their 
editors works just fine. Plus the latex user (being a regular user) also 
have the current TL in its PATH, so to update I just do

su - latex
tlmgr update --all --self

might even be possible to use

sudo -u latex tlmgr update --all --self

THIS IS IMPORTANT:

I will be a good idea to keep an eye on the umask settings for the latex 
user, all changes should be readable by everyone by default.

I used to have the multiuser LaTeX installation owned by me. But the 
umask settings made all changes private to me. So each time I made a 
change, I could use it, but no one else could. And I would only notice 
this when someone complained. So I switched to the separate user approach.

There is nothing to do if you are the owner of the texlive tree
yourself.  You don't need sudo then.  However, it might not work for
other users if your umask is more restrictive than 022.

Subject: [texhax] dynamically generating tikz node names
Message-ID: <87obmak03r.wl%neal@walfield.org>

I'm trying to programmatically name a bunch of tikz nodes (actually
pgfplots).  Here is a minimal example:

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{tikz}
  
  \begin{document}
  
  \def\alltraces{aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd}
  
  \def\plotall{
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \gdef\i{0}
    \node (t\i) at (0, 0) {};
    \foreach \trace in \alltraces {%
      \edef\prev{\i}
      \pgfmathadd{\i}{1}
      \xdef\i{\pgfmathresult}
      \node[anchor=north] (t\i) at (t\prev.south) {\i \trace};
    }
    \end{tikzpicture}
  }
  
  \plotall
  
  \end{document}

pgfmathresult returns numbers like 2.0 rather than 2 (\show\i returns,
e.g., \i=macro: ->1.0.), which I think confuses tikz.  Here's an error
message:

  ! Package pgf Error: No shape named t1 is known.
  
  See the pgf package documentation for explanation.
  Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
   ...                                              
                                                    
  l.21 \plotall

How can I get rid of the .0?  Is this actually the problem?  I don't
think I'm having the non-expandability problem that some people have,
e.g., [1], because my name macros (\i and \prev) are really expanding
to numbers and not token sequences...

  [1] http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/27769/is-it-possible-to-use-a-macro-to-name-a-tikz-node,

Is there perhaps a better way to dynamically name tikz nodes?

Thanks,

Neal

There are several ways to set up your environment, and maybe Lars' is 
the one advanced users will prefer, though not the one I use. I also use 
TeXLive but have installed Ubuntu (Debian) TL distribution to satisfy 
dependencies (nevertheless, I have AUCTeX from CVS).

What I do is prepend TeXLive path in /etc/environment:

PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/x86_64-linux:/usr/local/sbin: [...]"

And then (I think a restart is required) I sudo su to use tlmgr or whatever:

				sudo su
[sudo] password for axretif:
		/home/axretif# texhash
texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/ls-R...
texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-config/ls-R...

texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2012/../texmf-local/ls-R...
texhash: Updating /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-var/ls-R...
texhash: Done.

Root is the superuser, and can do whatever they want to.  
Permissions are not checked.  Somethings are impossible, so 
sometimes root sees errors that look like permissions.

Because root can do anything, people should not get in the habit 
of doing anything "normal" as root.  Root is there to maintain the 
system.  Root is not there to run TeX programs, or moreso to run 
anything in a GUI.  Most *buntu people using sudo are doing so 
from a GUI.  I can't remember there being any problems, but it is 
more likely to have problems from a GUI than from a plain old text 
console.

Consequently, the PATH for the root user should be much different 
than for ordinary users.  A good example is having '.' in the 
PATH, this is relatively common for users, it should never be 
present in the PATH of root.  Users probably have /usr/bin and 
/usr/local/bin near the front of the PATH, root should have /bin, 
/sbin, /usr/sbin and /usr/local/sbin near the front of the PATH, 
and might not even have /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin in the PATH.

Debian, and Debian based systems typically create UserIDs with the 
preferred name of the user, and at the same time creating a group 
with the same name.  This makes UserID _own_ the group of the same 
name.  And the owner of a group, as an ordinary user, can control 
the UserIDs of other logins that belong to that group.

If I am logged in as fred, I am allowed to make wilma a member of 
group 'fred'.  And I can do the same for barney and betty.  And if 
mrslate is on the same computer, there is nothing that requires 
fred to make mrslate a member of group fred.

Each user is allowed to administer their own group, and they can 
make group permissions as permissive or as closed as they want.  
They can also make use of SGID on programs, so that anyone in the 
group, can run programs as if it was the GROUP running them.  Some 
people have heard of problems with SUID, SGID is similar, and 
missing some of the headaches.

On Debian, the normal installation of PostgreSQL installs a 
postgres user.  It is not possible to login as the postgres user.  
But, there are adminstrative tasks that only the postgres user can 
do.  The only (proper?) way to do these, is to make use of the 
root user.

Related to the sudo command, is the su command.  Su allows a user 
to become another user.  With no argument, su assumes someone 
wants to become root, and so it prompts for the root password.  
But, su will allow users to "become" other users.  If fred does
  su wilma
fred is prompted for wilma's password, and if fred knows wilma's 
password, fred "assumes" the ID of wilma, and anything fred does 
until he closes the shell that su provided, is done as the user 
wilma.

The above is true for all users, except for root.  If root wants 
to assume any user's ID, no password is asked for.  I mentioned 
PostgreSQL earlier, and root can "assume" the postgres ID by doing
  su postgres
And no password is required.  Which is how the postgres user can 
do things, that need to be done manually, when the user postgres 
is not allowed to login.

This is too long.  I hope this trip into UN*X permissions has been 
of help.

Yes, I know I might not have the best setup. That's why I said advanced 
users might prefer Lars' method ---and yours as well, from what I gather.

You can use a simple macro to remove the decimal part:

    \def\nozero#1.0{#1}

and then replace the line

    \xdef\i{\pgfmathresult}

with

    \xdef\i{\expandafter\nozero\pgfmathresult}

I don't know whether there are better ways to plot PGF nodes, but at
least this solves your problem.

I think it should be doable with the `count` and `remember`options to 
the \foreach statement.

   \documentclass{article}
   \usepackage{tikz}

   \begin{document}

   \def\alltraces{aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd}
   \newcounter{j}%
   \def\plotall{
     \begin{tikzpicture}

     \node (t0) at (0, 0) {};
     \foreach \trace [count=\i] in \alltraces {%
	   \setcounter{j}{\i}\addtocounter{j}{-1}%
        \node[anchor=north] (t\i) at (t\thej.south) {\i \trace};
     }
     \end{tikzpicture}
   }

   \plotall

   \end{document}

Hovever, in my short test, I diden't succeed in getting `remember` to 
work.

Maybe just using `count` is better:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}

\def\alltraces{aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd}
\def\plotall{%
   \begin{tikzpicture}
   \node (t0) at (0, 0) {};
   \foreach \trace [count=\i from 1,count=\j from 0] in \alltraces {%
	\node[anchor=north] (t\i) at (t\j.south) {\i \trace};
   }%
   \end{tikzpicture}
}

\plotall

\end{document}

Message-ID: <502EF887.8080205@binghamton.edu>

I am running Ubuntu 10.04 Ubuntu LTS - the Lucid Lynx - released in 
April 2010. It has biblatex 0.8, and Synaptic package manager lists no 
other versions as options.

What is the best way for me to obtain and install a more recent version 
of biblatex? Are there deb repositories that I could add to my sources 
list, that would enable me to get newer biblatex via Synaptic or apt-get?

Thanks.

The LTS upgrade track to 12.04 LTS with the "first point
release" of 12.04 should be coming this month.  My guess is
that will have a more recent texlive.

Otherwise, consider installing a fresh texlive in /usr/local/,
as previously suggested.

I had forgotten about the options to \foreach.  Thanks for the
reminder: they simplify my code quite a bit.

Unfortunately, I couldn't make use of the remember option.  It helps
in my minimal working example, but my actual problem was more
complicated.

Thanks!

I would advise you to subscribe to the TeX on Mac OS X Mailing List:

There you can get an informed reply to this and any other question

Dear TeX users group

I am a fairly experienced LaTeX user with WinEdt but I am new to MacTex.   I have installed the MacTex distribution successfully (several times now!) and I am trying a short mathematical file.   The system cannot find any ' theorem' macros.  I am using amsart and the packages amsmath, amssymb, amsthm --- it does not complain that it cannot find these.  But it refuses to have anything to do with any spelling of 'theorem'.  I have tried 'Theorem" 'thm' etc but none of these work.   The equation, its arrays, fonts etc seem to work OK.   But where are the theorem macros hiding? 

I'd be grateful for any suggestions.

you have to declare theorems with

  \newtheorem{<name of environment>}{<heading text>}[<reference number>]

where <name of environment> is what you will
use with

  \begin{theorem}
  ...
  \end{theorem}

etc.  <heading text> is usually Theorem,
Corollary, etc.  (optionsl) <reference
number> is the sectioning within which
you want these things numbered, so you
would have "Theorem 3.1" for the first
theorem in section 3.  there are three
different theorem styles.

  texdoc amsthm

to read the documentation.

(sounds like you haven't used theorems
before.)

As a non-mathematician, that made no sense at all to me (it would
seem at first sight that <name of environment> is "theorem" in
the examples you cite), so I used TeXdoc as suggested.  That
told me :

> The \newtheorem command has two mandatory arguments; the first one is the

which (to this uninformed and totally insignificant individual) made
a great deal more sense.  So might it be clearer to express the idea
not as :

    seem at first sight that <name of environment> is "theorem" in
    the examples you cite), so I used TeXdoc as suggested.  That
    told me :

sigh.  chalk it up to too much brain
rot from transcribing a panel discussion
from the last tug meeting (there was no
publicly-accessible video, so this is
the only record).  the really important
thing is that the full documentation --
which is reasonably clear, i believe --
is in the manual.  manuals are written
to be read, but they so rarely are ...

anyhow, thanks for the clarification.

Dear Philip and Barbara

Thank you so much for your help.   I was, as I suspected, being idiotic.   I have just been copying all this `new theorem' stuff in preambles for years without thinking, and when I switched to the MAC I didn't copy (don't know how, yet!) but tried to generate a LaTeX file from memory?
Not a good idea.   Somehow I had got the idea that `theorem' is built in as an environment and all one had to do was to ring the changes when one wanted a Proposition or a Lemma or whatever?  

I am impressed by the efficiency of the TUG group. Thank you again.  All is now sorted.

Dear TeX users,

The dog days of summer are upon us in the northern hemisphere
(Siriusly), and the pace of news is slower. Rest assured that 
many great TeX projects are hard at work behind the scenes. 

At least most projects. One project does need your help, and that's
texconv. Specifically, we're looking for someone to maintain the 
web pages associated with this listing of converters from LaTeX to
word processors and vice versa. If you've got some spare time,
we'd love to hear from you.

In the next few days, TeXperience 2012 will be taking place in 
Beskydy, Czech Republic. Full information is at

The name commands have to be in Genealogy.tex:

Just comment out the one you don't want.

I don't know of a way to do this w/o touching Genealogy.tex, unless you had:

\input fontfile.tex

and then you made fontfile.tex a file which included the \define \fontfile lines, and you edited that.

Though if you're fiddling at that level, perhaps you could just make fontfile.tex a link to Garamond.tex and change the link to Calibri.tex or some other file at need.

Subject: [texhax] TeX Collection won't install on Mac OS 10.7.4
Message-ID: <4D241B2CAA657641A30147AA5BF6AE782BB29C2B47@NIHMLBX07.nih.gov>

Tex Haxers:

I installed the TeX Collection 2012 from the DVD on my Mac OS X 10.6.8
at home without any problem and it runs fine.

Now I'd like to install it on my new Mac OS 10.7.4 at work.

Here's what happens:

I put the DVD in the drive and close the door with the key.  The drive
appears on the desk top.  I double click on it.  It opens to show 16
files and directories.  I double click on the mactex directory.  It
opens and shows 9 objects.  I double click on MacTeX-2012-DVD.pkg and
a window pops up "Install MacTeX-2012-DVD".

Immediately a notification with a yellow triangle and a '!' slides
down from the top of the window.  The message is:

   Install DVD Missing

   The TUG TeX Collection DVD must be mounted to
   install TeX

   Close

On clicking on Close (the only option) the Install window closes and
I'm unable to install.

I've taken the DVD out and repeated this process (in case the DVD was
set into the drive wrong somehow).  It always gives the above message.

The package is at:

/Volumes/TEXCOL2012/mactex/MacTeX-2012-DVD.pkg

To see if my drive is ok, I tried last year's TeX Collection 2012 DVD.
It stepped through the process just fine but I stopped just before
installing since I already have it installed.

Maybe the DVD itself is bad?
/Volumes/TEXCOL2012/Readme.txt
/Volumes/TEXCOL2012/index.de.html
/Volumes/TEXCOL2012/index.en.html
all open just fine.

Obviously I could install from the internet, but first maybe someone
knows what's happening?

Quoting from the instructions...


The left/mid/right commands don't affect the formatting of superscript
citations.  

...

The appearance of the whole citation list is governed by "\@cite", (for
full-sized cites) and "\@citess" (for superscripts).  For more extensive changes
to the formatting, redefine these.  For example, to get brackets around the
list of superscript numbers you can do:
   "\renewcommand\@citess[1]{\textsuperscript{[#1]}}"
(after "\makeatletter").

Is there any way using LaTeX to pseudo-randomly scramble a text string?

For example is there any package with a command called, say \scramble
such that the syntax
  \scramble{blue} would produce something like eblu or uebl?

Thank you!

Have a look at

It may provide this feature already or you could implement this based on
the example code.

If you're using PDFTeX, then try code 1 below; if you happen to use
LuaTeX, try the much simpler code 2.

Hi Paul,

Thank you for the source code. I use XeLaTeX and I tried your "Code
1". But it said that
  \pdfuniformdeviate
was undefined. Is \pdfuniformdeviate only defined in PDFTex? Is there
some workaround for XeTeX?

Uwe -- Thank you also for the Chickenize document. I have downloaded
it and will see if I can find what I need in there if I can't get
Paul's solution to work under my XeLaTeX setup.

Dan

XeTeX is based on Knuth's TeX and thus doesn't inherit pdfTeX
extensions.    

Maybe you can use Donald Arseneau's random.tex package instead of
\pdfuniformdeviate.

Indeed you can "\input random.tex" at the beginning of your document and
replace \extractletters in my original code with this new definition:

    \def\extractletters#1{%
      \def\rest{}%
      \ifnum\letters>1
        \setrannum{\random}{1}{\letters}%
        \advance\letters-1 \scratch=1
        \getletter#1\endofword%
      \else
        #1%
      \fi
      }

Best,
Paul

I tried your new code and it works great---Thanks!!!

For a long time I have been using the lcg package for random number
generation. I modified your code to use lcg instead of random.tex.
However I don't know much about TeX programming. Would some one want
to take a look at the code below to see if anything is amiss?

Many thanks in advance,
Dan

As far as I can see it's ok. I've read the lcg doc quickly and it seems
that you can use "\reinitrand[first=1]" at the beginning of your document
and then only "\chrand[last=\letters]" in the code, but the only
improvement, if any, is speed. Also, the "%" after "\rand" on a line
of its own is useless, but it is harmless too.

Best,
Paul

I have to place the endnotes at the end of the book rather than at the end
of each chapter.  Easily done, as is.  In the default arrangement, all the
endnotes are grouped together wherever I write "*\theendnotes*."
What I need is the following, one further step.

First a heading, say "Notes to Chapter 1" (easily done with
*\renewcommand\notesname{Notes
to Chapter \thechapter}*)
then all the endnotes referenced by superscripts in the text of the chapter.

Then a heading that says, "Notes to Chapter 2"
then all the endnotes referenced by superscripts in the text of the chapter.

Obviously, resetting the endnote counter at the beginning of each chapter
with a *\setcounter{endnote}{0}* is a first step.
But what then.

Suggestions welcome.

Subject: [texhax] Problem with using the list command with cross-referencing

Dear All,
I am facing a problem with the use of list command.
I need to generate lists with specific numbering systems and then
cross-reference them in different parts.
By using the list command I am able to create lists with the correct system
of numbering.
However, when I use the \ref command to refer back to them it only prints
the Arabic numeral equivalent of the entry instead of the numbering system
I have used.
Is there any way I could resolve this so that I could get the correct
cross-reference inserted.
To illustrate my problem I have written a short code for this which states
my problem too.
---------------------------------------------

\documentclass[12pts,a4paper]{report}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{color}

\newcounter{sections}
\newcounter{sub-section}
\newcounter{clause}
\newcounter{sub-clause}
%this is the counter command




\title{Problem with cross-referencing using list command}

\author{Shubho Roy}

\begin{document}
\maketitle


\begin{list}{(\arabic{sub-section})}{\usecounter{sub-section}}
\item This is some text in sub-section which is using Arabic
  numerals. \label{sub-sec:arabic_numerals}
\begin{list}{(\alph{clause})}{\usecounter{clause}}
\item This is a clause which is using alphabetical numbering
\label{clause:alphabetical}
\begin{list}{(\roman{sub-clause})}{\usecounter{sub-clause}}
\item This is a sub-clause using roman numbering.
\label{sub-clause:roman_numerals}
\end{list}

\end{list}

\end{list}

The problem arising when I use label to reference to different parts
of the document.

\begin{itemize}
\item If I refer to the sub-section using the ref command I get a correct
reference like this: \ref{sub-sec:arabic_numerals}

\item However when I refer to the clause list which is a nested list and
uses alphabetical numbering I still get Arabic numbering as reference:
\ref{clause:alphabetical}. I would like this to be (a)

\item The same problem is available in the case of sub-clause list where I
should get roman numerals but I still get the Arabic numeral:
\ref{sub-clause:roman_numerals}. I would like this to be (i)

\end{itemize}

The hyperref command sends it to the correct link but the numbering
printed is always in Arabic while I have  used other numbering systems
for this.
Any help!!

Subject: [texhax] Pretty easy Question about \vspace and \paragraph
Message-ID: <tencent_690572907B89D9163EA26137@qq.com>

Hi everyone,

I am new to latex and I am trying to typesetting my homework using latex. A small problem confused me all the way.


Here is a small example:


\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\paragraph{Hello} this is a paragraph\\
\vspace{4mm}
something here\\
some other things here\\
\end{document}



When I compiled the code above, the \vspace does not show its effect on the direct following paragraph. "something here" still closely located with above paragraph. Can anybody tell me why? Or is there any method to make more space between the paragraph and "something here".


Thanks!!!

You have to read some manual before act and ask questions, like "Not So
Short Introduction to LaTeX", if you have TeX Live installed run 'texdoc
lshort' there you will find section 6.3.4 Vertical Space. Read it!

> Thanks!!!

In short: simply change `\vspace' to `\vspace*'

?? obviously read something about LaTeX, how else could he produce the
file? 

Your proposal has no effect.  Well, a paragraph ends at an empty line.
\\ doesn't end a paragraph, hence TeX is still in horizontal mode
where \vspace has no effect.

You can use \vspace only in vertical mode, i.e. between paragraphs.

Regarding \vspace*, Vladimir, please read the documentation yourself.
\vspace* should be avioded.  It's probably a last resort in some
situations.

??, please avoid manual line breaks (\\).  Insert an empty line
at the end of each paragraph.  \vspace is taken into account then. 

  \paragraph{Hello} this is a paragraph

  \vspace{4mm}
  something here

??, who told you to use \\ at all?  I ask because I've seen many
beginners who used \\ at the end of each line.  I'm wondering where
this suggestion comes from.

Regards,
  Reinhard

First I suggested to read manual, my `In short' was inprecise, yes. In
similar situations I use `\\[LENGTH]'

If one use it then it is on purpose, so that person should take into account
any side effects.

\begin{center}
VERY LONG TEXT TO BE CENTERED...
\end{center}
?

And take into account the indent.

Now I don't get you, there is line break command, `\\' which don't
change the mode (horiz. vs vert.) while `empty line' or `\par' separates
paragraphs, usually all except the first are indented.

Of course, in the example I want to show, centering long text it is
natural to use line-break than separate the text into paragraphs, imho.

Manually break text into lines?

P.S. The real question what ?? try to achieve when it uses `\\' and
`\vspace'.

*Sigh*  Both answers are wrong!

There are some correct aspects, like the question whether you are 
trying to end all paragraphs (or lines) with \\ when you should normally
use a blank line to end a paragraph and let TeX find the line breaks within
a paragraph.  And yes, you should read the documentation where you will
also find this answer...

To input your line-break with spacing, use the capability of \\, and don't
use \vspace:

This is a special line\\[4mm]

So what about \vspace?  Between paragraphs ("in vertical mode") \vspace inserts 
its space immediately, so inserting a blank line does put the vspace where you 
want, but it also changes other aspects of the typesetting.  Inside a paragraph,
\vspace puts its space below the current line.  In what you have tried, the 
\vspace occurs at the beginning of the line "something here", so the 4mm space
occurs after that line.  Therefore, if you insist on using \vspace, it would be

This is a special line\vspace{4mm}\\

The variant \vspace* works the same way, except that it tells not to break
the page there.  It is like the pair \nopagebreak\vspace.

I can't speak on the Mac setup.

But in TUG's TeXLive there is

  texmf/tex/amstex

with things for plain TeX and

  texmf/tex/latex/amsmath

with things for LaTeX.

"amstex" is generally no longer the name of a program.
That old program is emulated by running "tex" on a TeX
file that includes

\input amstex.tex

near the beginning.

"amslatex" is enabled in LaTeX

with something like

\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
