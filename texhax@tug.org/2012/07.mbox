Subject: [texhax] hyperref and lineno issue
Message-ID: <4FEF9AC3.1070405@alphabyte.co.nz>

Hi,

Apologies for the cross post. This is a bit urgent.

I am using the lineno package to generate page and line number cross 
references.

The lineno package is stated in the preamble as:
\usepackage[pagewise]{lineno}
\modulolinenumbers[7]
\renewcommand\linenumberfont{\normalfont\tiny\sffamily\textcolor{white}}

The hyperref package is stated in the preamble as:
\usepackage[pdfhighlight={/I}, hidelinks]{hyperref}


The cross references work correctly, that is,
\pageref{ll302}:\ref{ll302} points to an anchor \linelabel{ll302}.

This generates on the page "54:12", that is, page 54, line 12.

However, hyperrref does not appear to recognise linelabel. Therefore the 
error "pdfTeX warning (dest): name {UNDEFINED} has been referenced but 
does not exist, replaced by a fixed one" is generated. That means that 
all the references are pointing to page 1 instead of, in this case, page 54.

How do I get hyperref to recognise linelabel?

Cheers
Alan Litchfield

Actually, upon investigation I see that Uwe Luck is now the maintainer 
for lineno.sty and Heiko Oberdiek and Sebastian Rahtz are the 
maintainers for hyperref.

 From memory, they are all on the texhax mailing list. I cross posted 
onto that list, so hopefully they will respond.

Hello,

I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 (that is, the latest one) and I installed the package texlive-all.  With that, a document that used to compile now does not.   I now get this error.  

    !pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file ul9r8r): Font ul9r8r at 370 not found
     ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

I understand ul9 to be LuxiMono.  In my old installation I got that material from CTAN and put it in /usr/local/share/texmf because (I think) it did not come with the system.    In my new instaIlation I copied over all the files from my old /usr/local/share/texmf, ran texhash, and still see the above error.  

I am bringing LuxiMono in with this LaTeX command.

    \usepackage[scaled=0.88]{luximono}

TeX can see the relevant directory
  
    ~$ kpsewhich ul9.map
    /usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/luximono/ul9.map

and in the output I see that LaTeX has at least some idea of how to associate what I want with this material in /usr/local/share since I see this in the output.

    (./covernew.tex (/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/luxi/t1ul9.fd) 

The .pfb files are where they are supposed to be (because I copied all the files from my old /usr/local/texmf).  I have run this:

/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/luximono$ sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=ul9.map
updmap: This is updmap, version $Id: updmap 14402 2009-07-23 17:09:15Z karl $
updmap: using transcript file `/var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.log'
updmap: initial config file is `/var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg'

but it was really more out of desparation than anything thoughtful.

Do I need to add something to a config file somewhere?

Thank you,
Jim

Does kpsewhich find the pfb's? e.g.

kpsewhich ul9r8a.pfb

for me (using TUG TL11 and installed luximono with the getnonfreefonts 
script) I get

<some path>/TL/2011/texmf-local/fonts/type1/bh/luxi/ul9r8a.pfb

Lars,

Thanks for the suggestion.  It does.

    ftpmaint at millstone:~$ kpsewhich ul9r8a.pfb
    /usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/type1/public/luxi/ul9r8a.pfb

I had not thought that getnonfreefonts might apply.   Stupid of me.  I ran this command

    sudo getnonfreefonts-sys --all -v 2>&1 | tee getnonfreefonts.out

and the relevant section of the output is on the bottom of this message.  It looked good to me, but the error message that I get from trying to compile the document is unchanged.

This means that the map-file has not been activated.

In general this comes from a updmap/updmap-sys -confusion.

What do you get if you call

     kpsewhich pdftex.map

And where is the map file written by updmap-sys located?

pass, the Ubuntu TL is very old (is it still 2009?) I just know things 
work with TUG TL, so I tend to recommend that one over the Ubuntu one.

TL12 might be in Debian testing (or something like that)

Just to rule out other strange things, does this work:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{luximono}
\begin{document}
\ttfamily This is a test
\end{document}

But Jim did mention that he did a


sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=ul9.map

but of course there may be a local pdftex.map that is creating havoc

That's what I meant with "updmap/updmap-sys -confusion". updmap-sys
has no effect if a local pdftex.map created e.g. by updmap takes
precedence.

Ulrike,

OK

> In general this comes from a updmap/updmap-sys -confusion.

At least in my case, almost anything to do with updmap involves considerable confusion.

    ~$ kpsewhich pdftex.map
    /var/lib/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map

I'm guessing that this is it.

    ~$ updmap-sys -n
    updmap: This is updmap, version $Id: updmap 14402 2009-07-23 17:09:15Z karl $
    updmap: no permissions for writing /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.log', so no transcript
    updmap: output directory `/var/lib/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/updmap' is not writable.

    builtin35.map   ps2pk.map    psfonts_pk.map
    download35.map  psfonts.map  psfonts_t1.map

In case it is relevant, I put the output of listavailablemaps at the bottom of this message.  I don't grep any "Luxi" or "luxi" or "ul9" in there.

I understand your point.   But I know from past experience that if I go off-package then I will start being confused by the need to --force install packages that require texlive (such as AUCTeX), and other hair-pulling issues.  So there is a tradeoff involved.

It gives the same error.   I've included the output below.  

I should have sent the above originally as a minimal example.  Sorry.

Here is what I do after I have installed TUG TL on some Ubuntu and made 
sure it is in the search path

sudo apt-get install equivs
equivs-control texlive-local
wget http://www.tug.org/texlive/files/debian-control-ex.txt
cp debian-control-ex.txt texlive-local
equivs-build texlive-local
sudo dpkg -i texlive-local_2011-1~1_all.deb

I usually do not install in /usr/share but on a separate
partition, auctex will complain if this is missing

sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/texmf
sudo apt-get install auctex


the texlive_local package that we build above does all the trick

otherwise, one can also use

sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends emacs auctex

but auctex will still complain that the path above does not exists, but 
in that case we just hit it with a hammer

sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/texmf
sudo apt-get install -f

Map ul9.map

Boris,

Hello; look forward to seeing you in Boston.  You, and Lars and Ulrike, have helped me solve the problem, so I hope I can buy you a drink there.

In case it helps anyone else, here is what I did.

> 1.  Put in the file $TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg the line

> Map ul9.map

Thank you for this tip.  I didn't find that it made any difference.

    /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c$ kpsewhich -expand-var '$TEXMFLOCAL'
    /usr/local/share/texmf/

    cat /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/updmap-local.cfg
    # Activate LuxiMono
    # http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2012-July/019396.html
    Map ul9.map

> 2.  Run as root mktexlsr && update-updmap && updmap-sys

I did these as three separate sudo commands (it didn't seem to like the &&) but the minimal example that Lars wrote gives the same non-working result as earlier.

However, I noticed the .cfg file mentioned in the output of updmap-sys and it pointed me to /etc/texmf/updmap.d where I added the line you suggested "Map ul9.map" to the end of the file 00updmap.cfg.  Now after running 
    sudo update-updmap 
and 
    sudo updmap-sys
it finds the fonts.  

Thank you!
Jim

Looks rather like a workaround than a solution.  getnonfreefonts
heavily depends on updmap's --enable option, hence it's required that

  updmap[-sys] --enable Map=ul9.map

works.  I still don't know what's going on here.

Though I originally wrote getnonfreefonts for TeX Live from tug.org,
for some time the installer tries to support TL provided by Linux
diributors too, which usually have a slightly different directory
layout.  But I can't guarantee that it works everywhere.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Disclaimer:  I do not use Ubuntu, but if their packages are the same
as Debian ones, then I can understand this

On Debian there are files in /var/lib/tex-common/fontmap-cfg.  They
should include the names of files in /etc/texmf/updmap.d, which should
have the following magic format

# You can change/add entries to this file and changes will be preserved
# over upgrades, even if you have removed the main package prior
# (not if you purged it). You should leave the following pseudo
# comment present in the file!
# -_- DebPkgProvidedMaps -_-
# 
Map MAP


so on Debian one must

1.  Put the map file in the corresponding directory

2.  Put in /etc/texmf/updmap.d the file, say, 20ul9.map


# You can change/add entries to this file and changes will be preserved
# over upgrades, even if you have removed the main package prior
# (not if you purged it). You should leave the following pseudo
# comment present in the file!
# -_- DebPkgProvidedMaps -_-
# 
Map ul9.map

3.  Put in /var/lib/tex-common/fontmap-cfg the file ul9.list with one
    line

20ul9

If this looks crazy, this is.

The TeX Live installer doesn't put anything into standard search
paths.  If you are the only user of your computer, you can set PATH,
MANPATH, and INFOPATH in $HOME/.bashrc and the Ubuntu package manager
will not notice that there is an alien TeX Live installation at all.
Of course, I don't recommend to remove the TL-2009 system provided by
Ubuntu.  It doesn't hurt.

It's quite similar to what I'm doing.  I don't have TeX in PATH at
all.  Instead there are zillions of shell scripts (TL2003, TL2004,
... TL2012) which add a particular TeX system to PATH and start a new
shell.  The Gentoo Linux package manager isn't aware of those TeX
systems and I never ran into trouble.

I suppose that "apt-get install equivs", as proposed by Lars, is only
needed if TeX Live is added to PATH globally and thus visible to the
package management system.

I don't see any reason why TeX Live from tug.org can cause any
trouble.  It doesn't touch your system unless you tell it to do so.
It's definitely worth a try.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Well, this all seems to be about preserving map entries for manually
installed fonts over system upgrades.  It still doesn't explain why
updmap --enable didn't work for Jim.

Thank you to folks for the additional comments.

Reinhard, if I can help at all straightening out why Ubuntu doesn't behave as expected then please email me (just google me).

I would only change the PATH in .bashrc if I knew the user was a purely 
command-line person.
On Ubuntu I usually prefix it in within /etc/environment, then editors 
can still find the new LaTeX when opened from a menu or by double 
clicking on a file.

Well imho the source of the problem is here:

~$ updmap-sys -n
[...]
   updmap: no permissions for writing
/var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.log', so no transcript
   updmap: output directory `/var/lib/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/updmap'
is not writable.

If updmap-sys can't write new maps it naturally can't update
pdftex.map.

Pretty much my thoughts -- and what I've done since the time
that available disk space became essentially a non-issue for this.

The address space at Yahoo has been picked over.

Sure.  But this is only possible with a forgotten sudo.

Hello,

For a very long time, I've been trying to purchase a font (BA Math)
from MicroPress, but I've been unable to reach anyone at the company.
I'm writing you because I'm aware that MicroPress used to advertise
in tugboat.

Could you please direct me to someone who owns/runs/works for this
company? Alternatively, could you please notify someone who
owns/runs/works for this company that I and two other
colleagues of mine each wish to purchase this font?

Thank you very much,
Daniel

Subject: [texhax] Hyperref pointer misses the correct page
Message-ID: <4FF506FA.3010608@alphabyte.co.nz>

Hi all, and particularly the hyperref package maintainers.

With Uwe's help, my previous issues have have resolved nicely. However, 
in the process I have found a new problem. I shall try to summarise:

1. Create a standard label in a document.
2. Somewhere earlier in the document, a pageref is entered that points 
at the label created.
3. PDFLaTeX the document and page reference is created correctly (p. 106)
4. hyperref is loaded and links are created, but the hyperlink points to 
page 104 and not 106.

Further investigation shows that hyperref might be pointing at the 
\section text and not the actual page the label is on. In this case, the 
section head is on page 104. There are other instances where the section 
text is on the same page as the label and the hyperlink points to the 
right page.

\ref works as expected.

Yes, the hyperref package is loaded in the correct sequence.

Your help will be appreciated

Further,

I have tried the following approach:
1. I add the counter \newcounter{hyperfixer} into the preamble
2. I add the target \refstepcounter{hyperfixer}\label{theLabel} into the 
text
3. I reference the target with \hyperref[theLabel]{\pageref*{theLabel}} 
somewhere else in the text.

Page numbers are linking and displaying consistently now.

The problem seems to be that \refstepcounter{hyperfixer} is 
indiscriminate. While the page numbers are now correctly linking, 
section numbering is affected. That is, a section (e.g. 8.3) is 
displayed as 109 instead of 8.3 because, I think, it is the 109th anchor 
in the document. However, it links to the correct anchor. Garrrgh.

Fix one, break one,...

Alan

Sorry for the HTML again, read http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2012-July/ for .txt.

Sorry, Alan, this kind of question can only trigger the 
newbie ritual of asking for a minimal example,

    http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=minxampl
    
where I opt for "hacking down" -- take away as much as possible 
keeping the effect, and then perhaps use lorem ipsum 
to replace the actual text.

It may suffice for us to see the .aux file. 

I would not be surprised if it had something to do with my 
\ref and \pageref tricks; so we must see whether the 
phenomenon stays when you remove my macros or even 
any line number stuff.

What you write reminds me of experiences when I tried to 
get lineno+hyperref functionality via hyperref's usual 
treatment of counters. The hyperref documentations says 
something like whenever the user introduces a new kind of 
"objects" in addition to `section' etc. -- say, `extra', 
besides \theextra (that gets a default by the basic 
`\newcounter{extra}'), hyperref needs some \theHextra 
for generating the hyperlink. I tried this and, for some 
time, I got a broken link to a `section' that indeed started 
on a different page than where I wanted to link to. 
The reason was that hyperref (with counters) internally uses 
a "\@currentlabelname" that expanded to `section' because 
I had failed to change this for line numbers.

hyperref indeed contains large sections to deal with 
certain "objects" including footnotes, equations, and 
subfigures that need a more refined treatment than the 
other usual LaTeX "objects" like sections etc.

So I guess it is a problem with the setup of your new 
kind of things and its counter, and it may suffice to 
tell us about that (first).

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Use \phantomsection to create an anchor when there isn't a "natural"
one:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}
\section{A}\label{A}

\newpage
blub\label{B}

\newpage
blub\phantomsection\label{C}

\newpage

\pageref{A}, \pageref{B}, \pageref{C}


\end{document}

Hi,

To be honest I was resisting the requirement for a minimal example, 
simply because the real case is large and complex and I did not want to 
inflict that on all and sundry. I know it is easier to have that.

*sigh* I guess I will have to comply.

The aux file does not offer much that I can that is helpful.

I seen have multiple instances of the same/similar behaviour and the fix 
has been described as the process I described. However, while the page 
numbers are correctly listed, the counter seems to accumulate all counters.

To be honest I don't think the fix you proviedd, Uwe, has caused the 
problem because of the prevalence of postings about it.

Anyway, a minimal example has been constructed that comprises the 
elements concerned and illustrates the issue on the final page.

Regards
Alan

Hi Ulrike,

Thank goodness it was so simple.

I have changed the minimal example I posted earlier for future 
generations to illustrate how phantomsection works.

Thank you.

Subject: [texhax] TeX Queries (1)
Message-ID: <4ffaf68e.6757b40a.4970.6381@mx.google.com>

Hi folks
A few Tex queries from the TeXBook. I'm looking at the TeX source, 
however, you can download the PDF version at 
http://net.ytu.edu.cn/share/%D7%CA%C1%CF/texbook.pdf :

chapter 1, page 1, paragraph 1:
English words like `technology' stem from a Greek root <elipsis> 
which is an uppercase form of $\tau\epsilon\chi$.^^{TeX (actually 
\TeX), meaning of} ^^|\tau|^^|\epsilon|^^|\chi|

Does `^^{ ... }' signify a margin note?  I'm calling it a margine 
note because it appears separate from the main text on the right edge 
of the page.

I understand that in `^^|\tau|^^|\epsilon|^^|\chi|' each of the greek 
letters is displayed as a separate margin note.  What is the role of 
the `|' in the script?  I could be wrong, but it looks like a sort of 
flag for bypassing code that is enclosed within (`| ... |' ).  That 
said, what's interesting is that the `\' in `\tau', `epsilon' etc. is 
missing from the PDF.

paragraph 4:
On the other hand, it's important to notice <elipsis> 	other system 
names. In fact, ^{TEX} (pronounced <elipsis> processor developed by 
^{Honeywell Information Systems}. <elipsis> other medium that doesn't 
allow lowering of the `E', is to type `^|TeX|'. <elipsis>

I've also noticed that text preceded by just one `^' appears both in 
the paragraph where it's coded and as a margin note.  Is that the 
function of the single `^'?

chapter 2, page 3, paragraph 2:
In the first place, there are two kinds of <elipsis> that shows up as 
something like {\tt\char'22}, and an apostrophe or right-quote that 
looks like {\tt\char'15} or {\tt\char'23}.

`\char' according to some web sources maps numeric values to their 
corresponding unicode characters.  in the above extract the macro is 
separated from the numeric value by an apostrophe. I've seen both a 
grave accent (`) and a double quote mark (") used in examples on the 
web. Do the symbols declare different things about the number that 
follows them?

finally, what's the difference between `\eject' and `\vfil\eject'?  I 
understand `\ject' forces a page break.  A `\vfil' prefix I hear 
improves/mitigates the visual effect of `\ject' in certain 
circs.  Unfortunately, the text doesn't explain exactly what form the 
improvmenet takes.  Any clues would be appreciated.

Many thanks,
Paul

The whole situation with `^{...}' deals with the index; it is explained 
lines 23907 and following of the sources. (That the expressions are in 
the margin is only for proofreading.)

The syntax is: \char<number>; and a number can be octal (prefixed with a 
single quote) or hexadecimal (double quote), and of course decimal 
(unprefixed). For the grave I can't see any usage but denoting a number 
via a character, i.e. `\a (meaning 97, with the backslash optional in 
this case).

By the way, \char<number> simply typesets the character at position 
<number> in the font and has nothing to do with Unicode (especially as 
legacy TeX knows nothing of Unicode).

The \vfil means the page will be flushed upwards, unless equivalent or 
stronger \vfil's are used elswhere. For instance:

     paragraph1

     paragraph2

     \eject

will create a page with paragraph1 at the top and paragraph2 at the 
bottom because the only adjustment possible to fill the page is to 
stretch the interparagraph glue; \vfil avoids that.

Paul

Paul S: so let me get this right, `^^{ ... }' is not for inserting 
margin notes?  The TeXBook says it ``stand for a silent index 
entry''.  What does the single up arrow construct (`^{...}') do?  TBH 
I'm getting a bit confused now.

Not for benchmarks but just to allow people to examine the source code
of the book.

However, it's a pity that the copyright of the book doesn't explicitly
allow visually impaired people to compile the sources.  But I'm
convinced that neither Knuth nor Addison-Wesley object in this case.

It's definitely not appropriate to make such a PDF file available to
the public.  On the other hand, Paul had to provide the link because
he had to ask other people about the appearance and it wouldn't be
helpful if nobody knows what he's talking about.  You can blame the
one who exposed texbook.pdf to the internet, but certainly not Paul.

Regards,
  Reinhard

hi, paul,

    > A few Tex queries from the TeXBook. I'm looking at the TeX source,
    > [...]

when someone reports the existence of a
pdf file of the texbook online, i write
a note (if i can find someone to write it
to) pointing out the terms of the copyright
and requesting that the file be removed
from public view.

regarding the file cited in the original
question, it is a prepublication version,
with index entries also included as margin
notes; those disappeared when the version
to be printed was processed.  however, the
presence of the margin notes is one of the
reasons for the question, so it's worth
a mention.

    The whole situation with `^{...}' deals with the index; it is explained
    lines 23907 and following of the sources. (That the expressions are in
    the margin is only for proofreading.)

yes.  this is a temporary expedient to allow
the author to make sure that everything he
wanted to be indexed did, in fact, have an
index entry.

    Paul S: so let me get this right, `^^{ ... }' is not for inserting margin
    notes?  The TeXBook says it ``stand for a silent index entry''.  What does
    the single up arrow construct (`^{...}') do?  TBH I'm getting a bit
    confused now.

this input code *does* generate margin notes
for preliminary versions of the book, but
that is not its primary purpose, which is to
generate index entries.

the macros used to structure the texbook and
other volumes in the "computers and typesetting"
series are in the file  manmac.tex , which is
located in the same directory as plain.tex.

    The syntax is: \char<number>; and a number can be octal (prefixed with a
    single quote) or hexadecimal (double quote), and of course decimal
    (unprefixed). For the grave I can't see any usage but denoting a number
    via a character, i.e. `\a (meaning 97, with the backslash optional in
    this case).

    By the way, \char<number> simply typesets the character at position
    <number> in the font <elipsis>

    Paul S : Could you elaborate on this please? Is there a reference table for
    these values and their respective chars?

i have an octal / hex / decimal equivalence
table, but since it was set up for visual
inspection as a one-page ascii file, i think
it wouldn't help you much.  but if you would
like a copy, let me know and i'll send it to
you off line.

regarding what character (actually, glyph)
resides in which position, that varies with
the font.  alphabetic fonts created for tex
generally have digits and latin letters in
their "usual" ascii locations, but otherwise,
locations may be seemingly random.  one thing
they are not is arranged in unicode order.

for the computer modern fonts, the original
source of information regarding location is
in the .mf files used to generate the fonts.
that's not at all easy to slog through.
however, quite a bit can be deduced from the
\mathcode tables in plain.tex.  for example,
  \mathcode`\^^@="2201 % \cdot
can be taken apart as follows:
  \^^@ -- the input convention for the ascii value "00
  " -- the next four digits are hex
  2 -- the "class" of the symbol (2 = relation)
  2 -- the font (2 = symbol, cmsy)
  01 -- the location in the font
  % \cdot -- a comment saying what the symbol is

looking through plain.tex, i see that for
other characters, \delcode (for delimiters),
\chardef and \mathhexbox are also used to
"locate" symbols in fonts.  mostly the values
are represented in hex, but i see that the
location of accents is sometimes identified
in decimal (as in  \def\aa{\accent23a} ) or in
octal (as in  \def\AA{...{...\hbox{\char'27}}A} ).

it's possible that there's a better resource
for this that isn't visual, but i can't think
of one offhand.

regarding fonts that weren't originally
intended for tex use, the story is quite
different, and i can't be of much help.

I suggest that the author find a way to release the source files.

It's clear that open source propagates.  Closed systems don't.
It is harming TeX/LaTeX to have the source closed!!

The one-hat version also typesets the material in the main text, whereas
the two-hat version creates a `silent' index entry, i.e. not directly
related to something in the main text.

I don't know how \char works in XeTeX, but in LuaTeX you normally map
your fonts on Unicode, so that \char<number> should typeset the character
with codepoint <number>.

    I suggest that the author find a way to release the source files.

the *source* *is* open.
the pdf file is *not* the source.

    It's clear that open source propagates.  Closed systems don't.
    It is harming TeX/LaTeX to have the source closed!!

    Tom

i'm speaking here with some conflict of
interest.  knuth has assigned at least
part of the royalties for the texbook
to the tex users group.  i don't know
whether you're a member of tug or not,
but since so much of tex is free -- and
intended to remain that way -- fewer
and fewer people are becoming new members
*or renewing their membership* in most
of the tex groups around the world.
since these groups support both use
and development, and try to provide a
platform to help users to communicate
(see the domain for the address on this
message), keeping them strong and viable
is important.

It might help us to know two things:

- version 2.47 of what?

- what options of 'what' did you change?

Thanks to Justin Walker for comments and to Herbert Schulz for a solution
(see below).

*Solution:*
*Howdy,

At some point you probably were experimenting with changing the foreground
(letter) and background colors when there was a bug that prevented the
changes from appearing correctly. That bug is now fixed so you are seeing
things :-(.

The simplest way to fix this is to quit TeXShop and remove TeXShop's
preference file, TeXShop.plist, located in ~/Library/Preferences/. (In Lion
you hold the Option key down while clicking on Finder's Go Menu and you'll
see the item for going to ~/Library). The preference file will be re-built
with defaults set and all should be well. Assuming that works you'll have
to re-set-up your preferences.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz*

"[htbp]" cannot be used with longtable, because a longtable
environment might span several pages (the purpose of the environment).
Therefore it isn't a floating environment. "[htbp]" is typeset as
text in the first cell of the first row. Therefore a following
\hline throws the error with "Misplaced \noalign".

\begin{longtable}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
...
\end{longtable}

My copy of TexShop (version 2.47) seems to do the following:

If I use the Statistics macro to count words or characters, words in
footnotes do not seem to be included.  However, words in endnotes (using
the *endnote* package) do seem to count. I happen to use both footnotes and
endnotes in my manuscript.  It's not a crisis, of course, a curiosity.

What does the author mean by "makes the line tighter"?

What does "italic correction" actually mean?  I understand the idea

character taking up too much of the space that separates it from the 
next character in a roman font.  What I haven't been able to 
ascertain  from the TeXBook --- and would therefore be grateful for 
some elucidation from the list --- is the visual effect of the 
"correction".  for example, what does he mean by correction is about 
4 times etc. ?

My  apologies for revisiting this. Only problem is that i can't find 
the previous thread on the subject.

1: `\thinspace`` bla bla ''{'}

2: ``{`}rabit rabit {'}''

In 1 I'm assuming that the space between the two opening quote marks 
needs to be widened, hence, my use of `\thinspace', however, the 
space between the two closing quotes is sufficient although the 
closing single quote needs to be separated from the closing double 
quote mark, hence the `{}'

In 2 I've only applied the separation technique as it were with the 
`{}' grouping braces, assuming that the default spacing between the 
quote marks is the right width.

of course, I could be entirely wrong in both cases
So, without further ado, over to the list.

If the artificial break weren't there the line would be stretched too
much; in other words, it's just a hand-made justification.

The italic correction adds a thin kern whose width depends on the
preceding character; for instance, after an `f', it is much larger than
after a `c', because in the former, the difference between the glyph's
declared width and its real, visual width, i.e. its rightmost point,
is much larger than in the latter. You can try this:

  \def\checkitalic#1{%
    \bgroup
    \setbox0=\hbox{\it#1\/}
    \setbox1=\hbox{\it#1}
    \dimen0=\dimexpr\wd0-\wd1
    \count0=\numexpr100*\dimen0/\wd0
    \par\noindent
    The width of the italic correction is \the\dimen0,
    \the\count0 \% of the glyph's width (\the\wd0\ vs. \the\wd1).
    \egroup
    }

  \checkitalic{f}
  \checkitalic{c}

  \bye

Now, it is always the case that the widths of glyphs is different from
the coordinate of their rightmost point; generally, the width is
smaller, but in cases like `f' it is larger. Such sidebearings (here,
right sidebearing), as they are called, are crucial when glyphs sit next
to each other, otherwise they would be in contact -- or, in the case of
`f', the next glyph would seem much too far.

You don't need \thinspace in the first case, and {`}`` is perfectly ok.
But you need it in case 2, as explained in the TeXbook: the combination
outer-single-quote + inner double-quote is ok, the other way around is
not. (Why? I don't know; it seems to favor the British way over the
American way, which is surprising, since Don Knuth is American; but
there probably are other reasons.)

Best,
Paul

In the first case, \thinspace adds a litte bit more space than that
you get when using the braces.  Hence it's better not to mix them up.
With braces the result looks better IMO than with \thinspace.  For the
closing quotes the braces can be omitted, so

  {`}`` bla bla ''{'}

and

  {`}`` bla bla '''

yield the same result.

So far it seems that TeX looks for double quotes first and you have to
insert braces if the first character should be a single quote.

However, it doesn't explain why this doesn't work in the second example.
I vaguely remember that double quotes are ligatures in TeX.  This
could probably explain why both examples yield different results. 

Explanations are welcome.

Regards,
  Reinhard

for the computer modern fonts, double quotes
are definitely ligatures.  so two quotes in
a row (either leading or trailing) will
produce a "designed" double quote.  thus,
if three quotes are input together as ```,
tex (using computer modern) will interpret
the first two as a double, and only one
remains.  thus, if a single quote is to be
first, it has to be isolated in braces.

i can't speak for fonts that don't have tfm
files; presumably any font for which a tfm
file has been created will have been adjusted,
if necessary, to follow the tex conventions.
but i'm sure it can't be guaranteed for
"system" fonts as used by xetex or luatex.

regarding multiple quotes,

for the computer modern fonts, double quotes
are definitely ligatures.  so two quotes in
a row (either leading or trailing) will
produce a "designed" double quote.  thus,
if three quotes are input together as ```,
tex (using computer modern) will interpret
the first two as a double, and only one
remains.  thus, if a single quote is to be
first, it has to be isolated in braces.

Thanks BB and others for your input. Here is a revised version of my 
examples (and I'd be :grateful for your feedback):

%for double quotes enclosed in single quotes
{`}`` bla bla ''{'}
%or
{`}`` bla bla '''
%and the inverse
``{`} rabit rabit {'}''
%or
``` rabit rabit {'}''

What if for some odd reason we had to have two consecutive double 
quotes, would you just type four `s and 's?

Many thanks,

If the artificial break weren't there the line would be stretched too
much; in other words, it's just a hand-made justification.

Just to confirm, by "artificial break" are you refering to `\/' ?

 > What does "italic correction" actually mean?
		[snip]

The italic correction adds a thin kern whose width depends on the
preceding character; for instance, after an `f', it is much larger than
after a `c', because in the former, the difference between the glyph's
declared width and its real, visual width, i.e. its rightmost point,
is much larger than in the latter. You can try this:

Sorry, I'm not quite sure what you mean by the "declared" and "real" widths.

I used pdftex for testing.  The only difference between pdftex and
Knuth's tex in this respect is the output format.  Regarding fonts, in
TeX Live both engines are using the Blue Sky Research Type 1 fonts.
It would be strange if the tfm files are different from Knuth's,
especially because they are preloaded in the format files, which are
created from exactly the same source in both cases.

But Paul Isambert said that according to the TeXbook, the second line
in the following file requires \thinspace instead of braces.  Paul, do
you remember the page number?

---------------------------
{`}`` bla bla ''{'}

Oh, no, I refer to \break, which is what the commented expression "makes
the line tighter, to be fair" also refers to. This has nothing to do
with what is being talked about here.

If I'm not mistaken, you're using a screen reader, and perhaps it got
things wrong here; what Don Knuth is saying is (removing macros):

    The `\/' tells TeX to add an ``italic correction'' to the previous
    letter ...

Then he adds \break after the word ``an'' so that TeX breaks the line
here instead of elsewhere, because TeX's default result here is not very
good. His remark about a tighter line comments on the use of \break, not
italic correction at all.

Well then I wasn't exactly crystal clear. Let's try again: the width
of a glyph is technically independent of the drawing of that glyph.
Suppose for instance that a glyph's rightmost point is at x-coordinate
50; then the glyph's width could very well be 52. What I have called
the ``real'' width is 50, and the ``declared'' width is 52; in other
words, all glyphs have a little bit of space on either side so that
adjacent glyphs don't touch.

For some glyphs, however, and italic glyphs in particular, especially an
italic ``f'', the declared width is smaller than the rightmost point; in
the above example, the declared width would be, say, 48; that means that
the glyph's right side hangs over the next glyph, which is generally
good, as long as the next glyph is in italic too; with an upright
parenthesis, things go wrong, hence italic correction.

I hope I've been clearer this time!

Best,
Paul

Yes, TeX would ligature the quotes into double-quotes by pair; in other
words, in a string of quotes, TeX creates a double-quote for each
odd-numbered quote followed by another one.

Actually PDFTeX uses TFM's; the Type1 fonts are simply embedded in the
PDF (and expected to be similar to the TFM's), but for the meaningful
information (glyphs' widths, ligatures, kerning), the TFM's are used.

For TTF/OTF fonts, XeTeX introduced the ``trep'' and ``tlig'' tags to
perform TeX's usual substitutions and ligatures: remember that the
characters at position 39 and 96 in ASCII aren't quotation marks at all
to begin with (so you have to substitute the real marks, which so many
people forget to do, a sin worse than using Comic Sans in my opinion :) );
then you have the ``quotation mark + quotation mark => double quotation mark''
ligature we're dicussing here, but also ``hyphen + hyphen => endash'',
not to mention ``question mark + left quotation mark => inverted
question mark'', etc. Such substitutions and ligatures are also easily
implemented in LuaTeX.

Yes, page 5, or line 544 and following in the source.

Since we're at it, I forgot to mention that the use of brace to avoid
ligatures doesn't work in LuaTeX. You have to use a zero-width kern
instead, or anything else that doesn't affect the output visually.

Paul

Thank you. It seems we were at cross purposes there.  I won't ask you 
about the "default result"; however, I get the impression that 
without looking at the end result one wouldn't be able to make the 
necessary comparison and decide whether or not the `\break' insertion 
was preferable.  By the way I do use a screen reader.

yes thank you, it is much clearer; though of course, I have some new 
questions (I aint letting go yet :) ):

How is the declared width actually measured (i.e. where are the start 
and end points of the declared width)?

is there a declared height as well, and if so, can the declared width 
be different at different declared heights?

How can the declared width be less than the real width?  I've this 
image of a painting taking up more space 	than is available on the 
canvas, or is it the case that the declared width can be less than 
the real width only in parts where kerning is possible? Incidentally, 
I'm using the term kerning in the original sense as defined by 
wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning )

Does the algorithm determining the gap between two italic glyphs 
perform kerning --- shaving off the declared width --- on both 
adjacent glyphs, or just the preceding glyph?

Sorry for getting a bit bogged down in this. It's only through these 
questions and indeed your answers that I am able to build a mental 
picture of what's hidden from the screen reader in a PDF or DVI presentation.

Paul

The "declared width" is independent of the shape of the glyph.  It
also takes side bearings into account.  Its sole purpose is to tell
where to place the next glyph.  Thus it's also called "advance width".
BTW, it refers to the baseline, not to a rectangle.  Therefore, if a
font is slanted, extra space is needed between the last slanted glyph
and the next upright glyph.

There is no canvas limiting the size of a glyph because a glyph
description is a mathematical construct rather than something
physical.  Glyph descriptions can even have negative coordinates
(required for descenders, at least).  The only limitation is that
coordinate pairs in Type1 and TrueType fonts are integer numbers with
a limited range.

You are wondering why the physical width of an "f" exceeds advance
width in some fonts.  The reason is that if you derive the advance
width from the bounding box of the glyph shape, you need zillions of
kerning pairs.  An "f" is usually followed by another lowercase
character.  If the latter is an "i" or "l", ligatures are used anyway.
In all other cases it's fine that the bow of the "f" surmounts the
following glyph.  If an "f" is followed by an uppercase letter,
kerning has to be applied, of course.

Fonts are usually optimized to work with the least amount of kerning
pairs.  Font designers also have to take into account that Microsoft
refuses to support kerning in Type1 fonts at all, deliberately.

Regards,
  Reinhard

With the \break, TeX makes three lines for this subparagraph, as follows:

LINE 1: you get italicized and slanted words that look better. The `\/' tells TeX to add an 
LINE 2: ``italic correction'' to the previous letter, depending on that letter; this correction
LINE 3: is about four times as much for an `f' as for a `c, in a typical italic font.

Without the \break, i.e. with TeX left to its own devices, you get four
lines as follows:

LINE 1: you get italicized and slanted words that look better. The `\/' tells TeX
LINE 2: to add an ``italic correction'' to the previous letter, depending on that letter; this
LINE 3: correction is about four times as much for an `f' as for a `c, in a typical italic
LINE 4: font.

The latter result isn't so bad, but the lines are quite stretched, and
of course there is that fourth single-word line, smaller than the
paragraph indentation, which is quite bad-looking.

Interestingly, I've browsed the first fifteen chapters of the TeXbook,
and I haven't been able to find any last line of a paragraph being
smaller than the indentation (at least when directly followed by an
indented paragraph). So it seems that Knuth paid much attention to that,
and what we're discussing here might be a situation where he had to
rely on \break to do so. (There aren't so many \break's elsewhere in
the text.)

I'll try to complement Reinhard's answer.

That's up to the font designer; as Reinhard said, glyphs should simply
be able to go along without kerning in most cases.

No, a glyph's height is its topmost point; vertical spacing, at least
in horizontal writing systems, deals with lines, not individual glyphs,
so there is no use in adjusting the latter.

Reinhard answered to that. However, I'll add that your image of a canvas
isn't inaccurate, since in the days of metal typesetting some glyphs
extended outside their blocks.

> Does the algorithm determining the gap between two italic glyphs

Reinhard again answered to that. But note that there is no algorithm
determining kerning; instead, if kerning is to be performed between to
glyphs, that's only because it is declared as such in the font, i.e. the
font says there should be so much additional space (possibly negative)
between two glyphs.

Paul

Tex

Hope I am addressing this to the correct address.

I wish to create a rectangular box with corners having a small radius and
with an outline color and a different fill color.

I have tried

\color{blue}\Ovalbox{\color{yellow}Hello}

And the result is "Hello" within a blue outline box but with white fill (no
yellow, and tried other colors).

Using MikTeX 2.9, amsmath style and \fancybox package.

Can you help, please?

Subject: [texhax] tabularx and titletoc/titlesec: harmful interaction?
Message-ID: <20120717163513.GE5861@eureca.de>

Hi folks,

I must be doing something wrong, but can't find it (probably due to my lack
of in depth understanding of TeX).

I want to have a program create a document. The contents is hierarchically
structured, but with a depth in this structure that exceeds the usual
section/subsection/... structure. Some months ago on this mailing list I
read an idea how to solve that, which I used since then. It makes use of
titlesec and titletoc to define a free-form section hierarchy. Then it
defines an environment that knows about the current hierarchy level and
enters into the next level, adding the appropriate section/subsection/...
header.  This environment is the same no matter the current depth, keeping
track of the current depth via a counter (I called it mysecdepth).

All this works fine with ordinary text. But as soon as I add a tabularx
inside such a section, the depth tracking breaks down! Even though the
enclosing section reaches its end, and a new section on the same level as
the one containing the tabularx is started, this new section appears to be
a subsection of the one containing the tabularx!

(For an example, see end of this mail.)

I have the impression that using tabularx somehow changes the local change
of the counter mysecdepth into a global change. Is that the case? How can I
countermand this automatically?

Thanks a lot for any hints,

	Susan

Quick question based on some kinda TeX primitive/syntax confusion in my

How does one give a name, using \let, to a space character?  E.g., in

  \let \blankspace =

what comes after the '=' so that, for instance

will be typest as "AB.CD"?

Or am I hallucinating that this \let is possible?  It works fine for 
other non-space characters, e.g.,

Just a guess, does \let\blankspace\  work?  Too late today for
further investigations.  Have to go to bed now.

Not really.  It comes out as "AB. CD".  In other words, \  (backslash 
space) breaks \ignorespaces's concentration before it gets to the 'D'.

If one can define a name for a simple single input character (such as a 
left brace), how does one do it for a blank space character?  Or is it 
impossible by design, given how spaces are generally coalesced and turned 
into skip glue?

 > How can the declared width be less than the real width?
[snip]

The "declared width" is independent of the shape of the glyph.  It 
also takes side bearings into account.  Its sole purpose is to tell 
where to place the next glyph.  Thus it's also called "advance 
width". BTW, it refers to the baseline, not to a 
rectangle.  Therefore, if a font is slanted, extra space is needed 
between the last slanted glyph and the next upright glyph.

There is no canvas limiting the size of a glyph because a glyph 
description is a mathematical construct rather than something 
physical.  Glyph descriptions can even have negative coordinates 
(required for descenders, at least).  The only limitation is that 
coordinate pairs in Type1 and TrueType fonts are integer numbers with 
a limited range.

I suppose on the computer screen the painting-on-a-canvas analogy 
would translate as a rectangular area containing the glyph.  I was 
under the impression that the declared (or advanced)width measured 
the distance between the two sides of this rectangle.  As it only 
measures a portion of the line occupied by the glyph at the baseline 
(including the side bearings) the canvas analogy is a bit misleading. 
Actually, more than just a bit.

Are descenders glyphs that *descend* below the baseline?

You are wondering why the physical width of an "f" exceeds advance 
width in some fonts.  The reason is that if you derive the advance 
width from the bounding box of the glyph shape, you need zillions of 
kerning pairs.  An "f" is usually followed by another lowercase 
character.  If the latter is an "i" or "l", ligatures are used 
anyway. In all other cases it's fine that the bow of the "f" 
surmounts the following glyph.  If an "f" is followed by an uppercase 
letter, kerning has to be applied, of course.

Just to confirm, does kerning concerns both the adding and 
subtracting from the advanced width of the glyph?

Could you please elaborate why many more kerning pairs would be 
needed?  I'm not sure if i understand the problem.

Fonts are usually optimized to work with the least amount of kerning 
pairs.  Font designers also have to take into account that Microsoft 
refuses to support kerning in Type1 fonts at all, deliberately.

yes, kerning pairs can be an accessibility pain in the ... They are 
either invisible to the screen reader or show up as strange control 
characters (which comes to the same thing).

Many thanks,

[snip]

With the \break, TeX makes three lines for this subparagraph, as follows:

LINE 1: you get italicized and slanted words that look better. The 
`\/' tells TeX to add an
LINE 2: ``italic correction'' to the previous letter, depending on 
that letter; this correction
LINE 3: is about four times as much for an `f' as for a `c, in a 
typical italic font.

Without the \break, i.e. with TeX left to its own devices, you get 
four lines as follows:

LINE 1: you get italicized and slanted words that look better. The 
`\/' tells TeX
LINE 2: to add an ``italic correction'' to the previous letter, 
depending on that letter; this
LINE 3: correction is about four times as much for an `f' as for a 
`c, in a typical italic
LINE 4: font.

The latter result isn't so bad, but the lines are quite stretched, 
and of course there is that fourth single-word line, smaller than the 
paragraph indentation, which is quite bad-looking.

By "stretched" do you mean the tracking space is too wide?

Interestingly, I've browsed the first fifteen chapters of the 
TeXbook, and I haven't been able to find any last line of a paragraph 
being smaller than the indentation (at least when directly followed 
by an indented paragraph). So it seems that Knuth paid much attention 
to that, and what we're discussing here might be a situation where he 
had to rely on \break to do so. (There aren't so many \break's 
elsewhere in the text.)

Is there a substitute for the visual inspection of the lines --- for 
example, a formula or some other heuristics --- in determining the 
appropriate amount of tracking in a paragraph (to ensure the glyphs 
aren't too stretched or compressed together)?

[snip]
I'll try to complement Reinhard's answer.

 > How is the declared width actually measured (i.e. where are the 
start > and end points of the declared width)?

That's up to the font designer; as Reinhard said, glyphs should 
simply be able to go along without kerning in most cases.

No, a glyph's height is its topmost point; vertical spacing, at least 
in horizontal writing systems, deals with lines, not individual 
glyphs, so there is no use in adjusting the latter.

Could you expand a little more on vertical spacing please? I'm 
assuming it's not the same as leading, or is it?

[snip]

Finally, how, if at all, can tracking and kerning affect 
one-another?  for example, does the kerning of a pair of glyphs 
override the tracking in the line?

Many thanks,
Paul

Parts of glyphs, yes.

Visually, yes; technically, as far as TeX is concerned, no: it is the
adding of space, possibly negative.

An italic `f', for instance, crosses the baseline at x = 20, and then
moves upwards and to the right, so that it ends at x = 50. If its width
were equivalent to its rightmost point, then an `o' next to it would
be placed at x = 50. Thus there would be a gap of 30 units between the
base of the `f' and the base of the `o', and that gap would give the
impression that the letters are disconnected, and you'd need kerning.
However, since that is going to happen with all letters following an
italic `f', it's simpler to set the width of that glyph to something
less than 50 so that following glyphs are correctly placed without
additional kerning.

In a PDF, kerning is not denoted differently from interword space; as
far as I can tell from text extraction (searching for a string), a space
is interpreted as such if it doesn't exceed a certain amount. For
instance, with:

    ab\kern1pt cd
    ab\kern2pt cd

both Acrobat and Evince identify ``abcd'' in the first case but not in
the second (I haven't looked up the PDF reference to see whether that's
expected behavior).

Best,
Paul

If by ``tracking'' you mean interword space, then yes; if on the other
hand you mean interletter space, then no. Letterspacing (``tracking''
proper) can be used in recent TeX engines, but not in Knuth's legacy
TeX.

Unfortunately, I can't see how you can do that ``unvisually''. Of
course, TeX's algorithm is not visual at all: it simply has a default
space, plus maximum shrink and stretch of that space, and compute
everything so that the actual space in lines is as close as possible to
the default space (to put it simply). But space, stretch and shrink can
all be reset by hand (the default values are inherited from the font),
and that is a visual matter.

As for real tracking, i.e. letterspacing, it's all visual to me, but
perhaps somebody has found a nice formula (e.g. do not letterspace by
more than ...). The crux of the matter is that letterspacing should be
invisible, although of course it's often blatant in magazines with
narrow columns.

> Could you expand a little more on vertical spacing please? I'm 
> assuming it's not the same as leading, or is it?

It is. TeX takes into account the depth of the upper line (i.e. the
depth of the glyph with the larger descender) and height of the lower
line (i.e. the height of the glyph with the larger ascender) and adds
space so that the two baselines are spaced by a given amount
(\baselineskip). You can deactivate that operation, in which case the
distance between the baselines depends on the glyphs in the lines -- a
bad idea, of course.

> Finally, how, if at all, can tracking and kerning affect 
> one-another?  for example, does the kerning of a pair of glyphs 
> override the tracking in the line?

As I've said, TeX normally doesn't letterspace. Personally, I haven't
played with letterspacing enough to make a sensible answer here, but I
suppose, since letterspacing should be invisible, that it doesn't
replace kerning.

(Note that I've been talking about letterspacing in the main text here,
not the much more visible letterspacing sometimes used in all-cap text
like titles.)

Best,
Paul

Crikey, they are more complex than I would have thought necessary.
How about :

Hi folks,

I still do not understand why the described problem arised, and in case
someone knows, I am still interested in an explanation.

Nonetheless using etoolbox and a macro instead of the counter I managed to
work around the problem (work-around appended for the archives). Btw, I
first used etoolbox's \numdef, which showed the same problem although
according to the docs it is a local definition!

Here's an extract on ascenders and descenders from 
http://www.brightlemon.com/blog/typography-01-font-basics-what-is-x-height-leading-kerning-tracking-ascender-de-0 
:

"6. Ascenders (parts of a character which 'ascend' above it's 
x-height - upper staff of a lower case b,d,t etc )"

"7. Descenders (parts of a character which 'descend' below it's 
x-height - lower tail of a g or y etc.)"

Please feel free to plug any gaps in above definitions.

The following LaTeX source:
\documentclass[a4 12pt]{article}

%\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\begin {document}

fluffier firefly fisticuffs, flagstaff fireproofing, chiffchaff and riffraff.

\end{document}
Produces the following lines of nonsense in a PDF:

It's only when the
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
declaration is made that the output is readable.

The TeX source:
fluffier firefly fisticuffs, flagstaff fireproofing, chiffchaff and riffraff.
\end

also produces the same thing, although I don't know what remedies 
there are available in Plain TeX.

Many thanks,

let me get this right, there's no letter spacing applied in documents 
compiled by the legacy Tex engine. does that mean the glyphs are 
always adjacent and any gap between the characters is achieved by kerning?

By "invisible" do you mean not visible to the naked eye?  I'd imagine 
there  would be some gap between the glyphs if letter spacing were 
applied, thus, the total width of two contiguous glyphs would be 
their advanced (declared) widths plus the letter spacing between 
them, or is that completely off the mark?

Ah yes, that's clear now, thanks.
how is the depth or the height of the line measured? For example, 
does the depth start at the baseline and end at the tip of the lowest 
descender?
With leading "deactivated", does the TeX engine put any space between 
the lines at all?

The problem is with ligatures, not kerns, then. More precisely, the
fonts should be reencoded in the PDF. To do so, ``simply'' use cm-super
fonts rather than the original Computer Modern. They instruct PDFTeX to
reencode the fonts (via pdftex.map). Sorry I can't say much more on
this, but it's not a simple issue, and I'm not extremely competent.

Paul

Exactly (except that kerning does not necessarily produce a gap; more
often than not, it brings two glyphs closer to each other).

Space, stretch and shrink, a.k.a. \fontdimen 2, 3 and 4.

No, that's right, but letterspacing can be applied in two ways: one is
to really separate letters, and is used e.g. in all-cap titling; the
other is to add a very tiny amount of stretch between letters to help
justification. The former is made to be seen, but the letter is not, and
is definitely ugly when you can see it.

Yes, and the other way around for ascenders.

No, precisely. TeX stacks lines as they go, like ragged bricks without
mortar.

Not for me : a descender descends below the baseline, not
below the x-height.

But may I clarify "always adjacent"; this does mean that there
is still space between the rightmost extreme of the left glyph
and the leftmost extreme of the right glyph, but this space is
entirely due to their side-bearings and no additional space is
introduced by TeX.

> No, precisely. TeX stacks lines as they go, like ragged bricks without

That might create the wrong impression : it is not like ragged bricks
without mortar -- rather, it is like consecutive rows of non-uniform
bricks, all bricks on a single row sharing a single baseline, but
with some descending below that baseline and with each brick
potentially having a different height to its neighbour (to a maximum
of sixteen heights in standard TeX, because of an "optimisation"
in the specification of TFM files).  But there /is/ mortar; however,
it is used only to pad out the less-tall bricks to the height of
the tallest, and to pad out those bricks that lack descenders to
the depth of the deepest descender (if any such is present).  The
top of the tallest brick in the row below will align vertically
with the bottom of the deepest brick in the row above

LaTeX counters are meant to be global always, so commands/packages
that manipulate counters may go wrong if you increment them locally.
For example \include with \includeonly manages counter values, and 
also tabularx does (tabularx needs to restore counters to original
settings after each test-formatting used to measure column widths).

Hi
`{\bf f\/}' )
1. How is the above improved by the italic correction?

2. An italic correction is applied to the italic or slanted letter 
that precedes a a character (unless a full stop or a comma) in a 
roman type; according to the TeXbook, a bold f in quotes also 
requires its italic correction invoked.  can the list think of other 
cases where an italic correction would be desirable/necessary?

many thanks,
Paul

thanks for the explanation! So I'll instead use macros with \numdef (from
etoolbox) to increment the contents.

Without the italic correction, the leftmost part of the "f"
is far too close to the succeeding close quote.  Witj the
addition of the italic correction, the spacing 'twixt open
quote and f and between f and close quote look consistent.

The following illustrated another use for italic correction:

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
$d^3=d\/^3=d{}^3$

\end{document}

I am sorry, but you have really have to see the output to appreciate the 
difference.  It illustrates a real defect in tex.  The mit version of d 
leans well outside the "bounding box" in a way that almost other letter 
does (I think f might be another) and when you add a superscript, it 
crashes into that ascender.  I wrote a book that had several hundred d^n, 
where n was either a number or a letter.  These were face operators, for 
which the d was the only letter ever used.  I used a macro called \dee 
that added a little extra space, but an italic correction would have 
worked fine.  I didn't realize until I tested it just now that a pair of 
braces would also have worked.

I don't think that is a very helpful remark when addressed to
someone who is blind, Michael.  If there is something tangible that
can be seen, then that same something can be described in words,
as I tried to do when the "row of bricks" analogy arose.

I have processed your example using PdfLaTeX, and examined the output
at the greatest magnification of which Adobe Acrobat 7 Professional
is capable.  I can detect not one iota of difference in the three
instances of d^3; what am I missing ?

    I am sorry, but you have really have to see the output to appreciate the
    difference.  It illustrates a real defect in tex.  The mit version of d
    leans well outside the "bounding box" in a way that almost other letter
    does (I think f might be another) and when you add a superscript, it
    crashes into that ascender.  I wrote a book that had several hundred d^n,

unlike all other letters in the cm math italic
font, the d has no built-in "overhang" spacing.
i've never actually asked, but i think the
reason for this is that knuth uses d only for
indicating derivatives (as in "dx"), not for
variables, and for that use, he prefers it to
be directly adjacent to the variable involved,
not separated by a small space.

this is a frequent practice in the u.s. among
mathematicians, and ignores the iso standard
that says the derivative should be indicated
by an upright d.  (that standard was mainly
influenced by engineers and physicists,
i believe, not mathematicians; it's more
rigorously followed in europe than in the
u.s., but traditions differ.)

so yes, it does cause problems when d is
used as a variable, but mathematicians who
use it that way seem to be in the minority.
(sorry, michael.  i think your solution of
adopting \dee is the best way out.)

But what of a second derivative ?  That would require d^2y/dx^2,
which will surely generate almost exactly the same inteference
as Michael asserts obtains in d^3 (but which Lars and I cannot see).

good question.  there's not a single one
in the texbook -- i checked with grep in
texbook.tex; i also checked for "d{}" and
"d\/" and several other increasingly
obscure possibilities ... nothing.

so we have no direct knuthian example.

however, i don't see the difference either;
here's my test:

  \documentclass[12pt]{article}
  \begin{document}
  \Large
  $dx + d^2x + d{}^2x + d\/^2x$
  \end{document}

definitely a puzzlement.

I wonder if I'm seeing the same thing as you.

To check this I added a verbatim copy of the markup, ran it
through LaTeX, opened xdvi with shrink level 1, and took a
screenshot of the (small) relevant area.

It's attached here.

Are we seeing the same thing?

Indeed the right side-bearing is minimal for d, and noticably
less than for l, but it is not zero.

I think so too.

The exponent is crowded, but does not collide with the d.
They might merge in a photocopy.

Indeed those three spacings have to all be the same -- they
have the d followed by its italic correction. M Barr was right
to use a small space in his document, and wrong now to think
that \/ would have done the same.

An example that shows the (non-)differences is

  \documentclass[12pt]{article}
  \begin{document}
  \setlength\fboxrule{.1pt} \setlength\fboxsep{0pt}
  \Large
  $dx + d^2x + d{}^2x + d\/^2x$ \fbox{\the\textfont1 d}

  $lx + l^2x + l{}^2x + l\/^2x$ \fbox{\the\textfont1 l}

  \end{document}

Mea culpa. It seems that the difference I saw disappeared at a higher 
magnification in yap.  I still see it at the standard magnification, nor 
can I explain why \/ changes it, but it does.  It does remain that d^3 
looks awful.  Now bb has raised the question of whether the d ought to be 
in roman, not mit.  The face operator d is historically related (by the 
Stokes theorem) to the differential d.

But as a matter of practice, it seems to me that we mathematicians have 
settled on a different convention: multi-character identifiers are in 
roman and single character identifiers are in mit.  This is very useful as 
it means that you can instantly tell when a multi-character string is a 
unit.  And much more important than whether something is a constant or 
variable, a distinction that is not clearcut.  For example, it is 
perfectly legitimate to say that \pi = 4 in \ell^1.

Could you try re-arranging the ordering, Michael, and see if at normal
magnification the artifact remains in the same place on your screen,
regardless of rhe markup used to populate that region ?  I suspect it
is no more than a rasterising issue.

    What's overhang spacing?

probably not a very good characterization.

what i meant is that the rightmost point of
the letter on the baseline does not extend
as far to the right as does some point
farther up.  in the case of the d (and in
[particular the f), the rightmost point
is at the top; for a letter like k the
rightmost point is above the baseline, but
not at the top of the letter.  (all these
examples refer to lowercase letters.)

the distance between the rightmost point
on the baseline and the "actual" rightmost
point is usually pretty close to the value
assigned to the italic correction -- except
for the d.

Good afternoon.

The reason i am sending this email is just to inform that your MacTeX .pkg
file that is available on http://www.tug.org/mactex/2012/ fails unless
people download this same package from torrent way.

I think you should turn this information more clear, because i had to make
kind of hard search, and i saw people with the same problem :).

Just an advise :). Put "Download MacTeX from torrents if u have MacOX 10.7
(that's my version :) )"

Greetings,

I would like to process some of my early *.tex files.
For the tables in those files I need 2 procedures
for input:

tables 
tableins.hdr

Instead of rewiting the table sections, I would very
much like to obtain a copy of these programs.

My last installed system is: Y&Y TeX System [2001]

I would appreciate very much if you could help me.

Have a great day,

I have been using Latex daily for several years.  Mostly using 'pdflatex'
as part of cygwin on Windows.

Today I tried to setup my machine at my new job to process some of the
Latex documents I had written.  I found the old way I download Latex is no
longer working.   I cannot find 'tetex' within cygwin so I downloaded
TexLive.  After installing I write to compile my .tex file using 'pdflatex'
and seems like it is not part of TexLive.

I felt stuck since I rely on Latex for all my writings.

Is there a page or link I should view to learn how to install Latex
properly on cygwin?

Thanks.

I see no difference at all between the three. The fact is, TeX applies
italic correction before placing superscripts so I fail to see how
applying it manually would have made any difference.

I just checked cmmi10.tfm, there is no italic correction for the d
indeed, so any of those construction wouldn't make any visible
difference.

A better test:

\tracingonline=1
\showboxbreadth=\maxdimen
$d^3 d\/^3 d{}^3$
\showlists
\bye

Which gives:

\teni d
\hbox(4.51111+0.0)x4.48613, shifted -3.62892
.\sevenrm 3
\teni d
\kern0.0
\hbox(4.51111+0.0)x4.48613, shifted -3.62892
.\sevenrm 3
\teni d
\hbox(0.0+0.0)x0.0
\hbox(4.51111+0.0)x4.48613, shifted -3.62892
.\sevenrm 3

So \/ is inserting a zero kern, and {} is inserting a zero width box,
nothing else.

 Khaled

Well, an 11-year old TeX version may be hard to find. Y&Y TeX was
commercial AFAIK, that won't make it easier.

Can't you convert the documents to some standard LaTeX? How do the specific
parts of your document look like where these procedures are used?

Do you have any specific reason to use LaTeX with Cygwin? TeX Live runs
great under Windows so IMHO there may be no reason to stick to Cygwin.

How did you install it?  If you installed a TeX Live as a Cygwin
package, I could imagine that TeX Live is split into several Cygwin
packages and you didn't install all of them.

If you installed TeX Live from tug.org, you have to add the directory
containing the binaries (usually
/usr/local/texlive/1012/bin/i386-cygwin) to $PATH manually and to
start a new shell.

If you have further questions, please explain what exactly you've done
so far.

Uwe, do you really believe that someone who deliberately installed

And yet, it worked for me and so many others. You also have a large 
number of mirrors around the globe on ctan. There are torrents 
established too.

Your suspicion is correct.  When I compiled
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
$d^3=d\/^3=d{}^3$

$d\/^3=d^3=d{}^3$
\end{document}

The two lines appeared identical, with just slightly more space in the 
second and third elements.

>From the replies, it appears that italic correction is automatic before 
superscripts.  But clearly not enough in the case of the d and perhaps f.

Phil, whenever something looks worse at low resolution, it *is* a
rasterising issue.  In both file formats, DVI and PDF, the position
of glyphs are described by coordinate pairs, i.e. by two numbers.
These numbers are completely independent of the actual resolution.
Even glyph descriptions in TTF, OTF, and Type1 fonts rely on
coordinate pairs.  All what counts are these numbers.

Of course, rounding errors are unavoidable at low resolutions.  Thus,
whatever you see at low resolutions is absolutely meaningless.  Even
if Michael re-arranges the TeX code, the result will be arbitrary at
low resolutions.

Rasterising is a very difficult task.  I can imagine improvements,
but they would slow down screen viewers significantly.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Am I correct in thinking that there's very little italic correction 
possible for the d? If my memory serves me well, the right-most point 
on the baseline is very close to the actual right-most point of the 
glyph (the real width?)

tables.tex is still on ctan.  (Why is it under /macros/latex209

Never heard of tableins.hdr.  I suspect it is your own file.

regarding the lack of an italic correction
on the d, paul stanley asks,

    Am I correct in thinking that there's very little italic correction
    possible for the d? If my memory serves me well, the right-most point on
    the baseline is very close to the actual right-most point of the glyph
    (the real width?)

no, actually quite a bit of correction could
be made for the italic d.  although the d is
a bit less tall than the ell, the slope is
the same, and the top serifs have similar
shape so they don't have any effect.

so "dx" has quite a different appearance than
"lx", although if both d and l are variables,
one would expect about the same space between
them and the x.  and it's not there with d.

if one is using d as a variable (though it's
apparently rather rare, relative to the use
of d as the differential), manual spacing
is sometimes necessary (for computer modern).

Yes, but the whole point of asking <ichael to re-order the markup
was to try to /confirm/ the hypothesis that what he was experiencing
was no more than a rasterisation error.  If

$d^3=d\/^3=d{}^3$
$d\/^3=d{}^3=d^3$
$d{}^3=d^3=d\/^3$

all produce artifacts at the same screen position, we can be
almost certain that it is not the markup that is causing this,
as Michael originally believed, but rasterisation.

is this --- and other similar apparent inconsistenceis --- part of 
the basic makeup of TeX (i.e. the primitives), or are they part of a 
more high-level TeX format specification (e.g. plain TeX) and can 
therefore be changed at that level if required?

Dear TeX users,

This month's newsletter is slightly delayed because I was in Boston for
the 33rd TUG Annual Meeting. We had an amazing array of speakers on
numerous topics, and I managed to come home with a very long list of
things to read. The next issue of TUGboat will contain the proceedings
of the conference, although a few papers (such as mine) will probably
appear in the following issue. (As always, if you have any articles,
reviews, or anything else you'd like to see in TUGboat, please let us
know.)

Feel like helping out on a TeX or TeX-related project? Karl Berry

This is purely a "feature" of the CM math fonts. Use a different font
if you don't like it.

I believe it is hard-wired in the (Computer Modern) fonts,
Paul; external to TeX, and capable of being corrected in
a derived variant. Perhaps the font wizards of Poland
(and elsewhere) can comment as to whether they have
addressed this issue in (e.g.,) the Latin Modern fonts.

Twenty minutes or so after this question came across my email

I don't have anything to contribute to this person's queries, but 
reading the various responses, I think there are large parts 
(all?) of this which probably should get summarised at some point

When you say "for TUG", Gordon, what exactly do you have in mind ?
At least two Board members are already participating in the debate.
Were you thinking, rather, that an article in TUGboat might on the
subject might be of interest to some/many/most/all TUG members, and
if so, are you considering writing such an article ?

Or for someone to say, this has already been covered in ....

I don't think I should volunteer.  I have started writing entirely 
too many things which are not finished.  A big chunk of them 
suffering from exponential increases in complexity, the longer I 
work on them.

It would be nice if I get one of these documents about how ASD has 
touched my life to be finished, and yet accessible to the average 
person (preferably someone with some control over the hiring 
process).  But that isn't a problem for TUG or TeXhax. :-)

Probably a good idea, since it would offer an opportunity to point out 
that Italic Correction has to be specific both to the typeface and to 
the individual character in that typeface.  It doesn't make sense 
otherwise.  It isn't even accessible as a \fontdimen, because there is 
no assurance that it will be exactly the same for all characters in the 
font.

By the way, I wish DEK had included two more \fontdimens as part of the 
usual set for regular book fonts.  I have to add the equivalent of 
Adobe's ascender height and descender depth as additional \fontdimens to 
any font I regularly use.  That is the only way to ensure that the 
\strut is proportional to the specific font, with \strutheight and 
\strutdepth available for line spacing adjustments in whatever leading 
is in use.  Quite important for insertions of CJK characters, etc.,  in 
a line of Roman type.

What aspect?

If you mean for installation into old styles of TeX, then Philipp
Lehman's Font Installation Guide:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Type1fonts/fontinstallationguide/

If you mean ``just'' using them, then von Bechtolsheim's _TeX in Practice_ Vol. 2: Paragraphs, Math, and Fonts_ is quite good.

If you mean installing and using them in interesting ways, then Alan Hoenig's _TeX Unbound_:

http://www.amazon.com/TeX-Unbound-LaTeX-Strategies-Graphics/dp/019509686X

If you mean using them in a ``modern'' TeX system then Will Robertson's FontSpec:

http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/xetex/latex/fontspec/

If you haven't read _The Elements of Typographic Style_ by Robert Bringhurst, it should go to the top of the list.

I list a couple of books here:

http://mysite.verizon.net/william_franklin_adams/books-typography.html

Other good background materials, Simon Oliver's _Introduction to Typography_.

I also list some books which you may find of interest on this broadside:

While I can appreciate the desire, if I understand correctly, the newer TeX variants, XeTeX and LuaTeX do afford this information, albeit somewhat indirectly by making the overall bounding box accessible, so one can compare box heights / depths to calculate these values.

There's a specific key for turning this on in XeTeX (I think I argued successfully for it being turned on by default) --- see if there's discussion of the Adobe Caslon example in the xetex mailing list.

you named a number of books which might be interesting and helpful, 
however, none of them are accessible. I am not interested in font 
installation at this stage, I'm merely looking for a text, be it a 
web document, a TeX file,  or an accessible PDF (a bit of a 
contradiction I know) detailing the very basics of fonts, how they 
are structured, designed, the terminology  and so forth,taking 
nothing for granted about the reader's prior knowledge of the subjet matter.

If memory serves, the two .tex files do touch on some terminology. There might be some articles written for TUGboat which would be of use in source form --- you could contact the webmaster at tug.org address to get access to the source mayhap.

One other thought of a text --- have you looked at the METAFONT book?

http://mirror.jmu.edu/pub/CTAN/help/Catalogue/entries/mfbook.html

A text, accessible to vision-impaired people on typography is an interesting idea --- I'm having a hard time envisioning such a thing though (but certainly Paul Isambert's row of bricks analogy is an excellent indication of the feasibility of such a thing).

I've been putting off writing a book on typography for Addison-Wesley for a long while now --- if I go back to doing this, would you be willing to be a first reader of it and provide me w/ feedback?

Paul,

I'm not sure what you mean by `accessible' --- can't you get hold of any of the mentioned texts or is it that having read them they don't provide what you are after?

In any case I suggest that Bringhurst's `The Elements of Typographic Style' and Smeijers' `Counterpunch' will help you.

I'm surprised that you don't find William's `Typeface Terminology' accessible in both senses of the word. 

One book that is not in William's list is Karen Cheng, `Designing Type', Yale University Press, 2005 (ISBN 0-300-11150-9). 

My `A Few Notes on Book Design' has a little on fonts, though whether it will help you I don't know. Try 
texdoc memdesign
which should display it on your terminal, otherwise it's on CTAN in /info/memdesign

Likely, the problem is it's a monolothic .pdf w/ no accessibility tagging (in my defense, I don't think that there were standards for that back when I made that).

If memory serves, the OP (Paul Stanley) is visually-impaired.

I'm sure that when viewed in a screen-reader, the broadside (which was originally created as one of a pair of documents to show how the same type specifications could be eminently legible and readable at one size could be difficult to read, while still visually interesting in another format) would be an opaque, un-readable, in-accessible mess.

That does remind me that the source for the matching, intended-as-legible booklet, ``One Typeface: Many Fonts'' is available:

http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/onetype.tex

and it may be useful enough to Paul to justify this message.

Hi Paul,
though the PostScript Type 1 font format is only one of many, it's
probably the best one to explore the structure of fonts in general.
The advantage is that glyphs are described by a programming language.
Actually, a Type 1 font is a program and a glyph is a procedure.

The Type 1 reference manual can be downloaded from Adobe:

  http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF

It contains a few graphics in order to illustrate things which are
already described in the text very well.  Many of them are only for
convenience, hence I think this manual is useful if you can read the
text.  You can skip many chapters since it's not necessary to know how
the binary files are created and how they are encrypted.

If you want to investigate a particular font, you would disassemble it
anyway.  With TeX Live under Unix, for instance,

  t1disasm `kpsewhich cmr10.pfb`

displays the PostScript source code.

Similar to TeX, metric information is in separate files.  The Adobe
Font Metrics file format is described in TechNote 5004:

  http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/5004.AFM_Spec.pdf

It's a simple ASCII file format and you can locate AFM files with

  kpsewhich cmr10.afm

, for example.


TrueType fonts are binary files and consist of data structures.  IMO
they are more complex and thus more difficult to understand.

They are described here:

  https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/ 


There might be other resources available in the internet, especially
describing terminology, but I fear that most of them make heavy use
of bitmap graphics.  

Regards,
  Reinhard

It means the text isn't accessible to a screen reader user i.e. a 
blind person or anyone with a disability that makes them reliant on 
text-to-speech programs.  PDFs can be a pain in the neck to read with 
a screen reader.  Even when the file is properly tagged the text has 
to be extracted and sometimes the process results in what I call 
screen reader blackouts.  In short, PDFs are not very popular with 
blind people.

Many thanks,
Paul

That is very interesting, and not widely known, or rather deduced, by 
people like myself.

How satisfactory is LibreOffice odt?  There are times when it would be 
useful for me  to know that.  I suppose one fairly sure way to get 
hearable text with a minimum of interference is to drop it into a gedit 
file as pure, barely formatted text.

Dear Sir/Madam:

I am using LaTeX on TeX-Live 2009 program.  Recently, I started to have the following problem.

I make a mistake that stops compiling (such as "undefined control sequence").  I correct it and click Typset again.  A new error message appears, which is not to anything I typed, and which I do not know how to correct.  I must discard the .aux file to start new compiling.

Could you be so kind as to help me to correct this problem.  I am only a mathematician and not very proficient with computers.  If you prefer to call me, my home phone number is (520) 297-7755, and I am at home most of the time.

Thank you, and best regards.

I suspect there is an implied "+1" in front of (520), so calling
from the UK is not really an option.  However ...  Have you tried
compiling more than once, and seeing if the problem disappears
on a second or subsequent run ?  It seems to me that if there
is an error in an auxiliary file, and you can persuade the
compilation to run to completion (by entering "s" for "scroll",
"q" for "quiet" or "b" for batch" in response to the error prompt),
the problem may be capable of rectifying itself without a need
to manually delete the auxiliary files.

Of course, I may be wrong (I frequently am).

Dear Washek,

unfortunately none will be able to help you with your problem unless you
give a detailed explanation of the problem you encounter. LaTeX is quite a
complex system and thus your input may generate quite different errors.

The best you can do is to create a MWE, a minimal working example (see
http://www.minimalbeispiel.de/mini-en.html), that shows the error or
problem. In most cases you will find the bug yourself when creating the
example file.

TeX Live 2009 is also completely outdated, the current version is TeX Live
2012. If the problem you encounter is indeed caused by an error in a
stylefile there is a good chance that it has been fixed in later versions.
So please consider upgrading your TeX Live installation. :-)

Uwe

Unless it turns out that there is really a bug in a .sty file, I
wouldn't recommend an upgrade.  TeX Live 2009 worked fine for me.

It's not encouraging if such an upgrade doesn't solve the problem.

In order to decide whether a TeX Live upgrade is necessary, we
definitely need more information.

  Reinhard

I have an index entry for "semi-major axis" which appears to generate an error when hyper ref is operating:
Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \semi
                 -major
l.63 \hyperindexformat{\semi-major}{124}
                                          ,

I presume I need somehow to protect my entry (currently of the form \index{semi-major axis}) so that hyper ref reads it as a single "word".  What is the proper syntax for this?

The following file runs without problems:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{makeidx}
\makeindex
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}
Hello\index{semi-major axis}
\printindex
\end{document}

Probably you have something like

  \index{foo|semi-major}

That means, that the page number of "foo" should be formatted
with command "\semi-major". See the documentation of Makeindex.

Thus check page 124 for \index commands with "semi-major" and "|".

I have a macro that accepts a certain text argument. This text may
sometimes contain curly braces.

I find that such curly braces are being interpreted by latex instead of
treated literally and as long as there is a matching brace, they just get
silently ignored.

Escaping the braces with back slash is leading to error like:

! Undefined control sequence.
\\  ->\let \reserved at e 
                       \relax \let \reserved at f \relax \@ifstar {\let

Is it not possible to send text with curly braces as macro argument?

It is very very difficult.  If you understand category codes, you
can manipulate them to temporarily make braces behave differently,
but this will conflict with any need that your macro places on
their normal definition.  Possibly simpler (depending on what you
are really setting out to achieve) is to pass the rather more
complex

	{\char `\{}

and/or

	{\char `\{}

but a very great deal depends on what you are trying to accomplish.

Is it not highly probable, Joseph, that the best that
can reasonably be expected in the present circumstances
is a  minimal /non-/working example ?

No, the "working" in `minimal working example' (MWE) does not
mean that the example successfully runs without problems.
In contrary, the MWE should be complete and -- most important --
should show the problem. Of course, in this case it would
probably generate an error message.

Or shorter: A working TeX file would be a non-working MWE. ;-)

something like that, basically \phantom{...} takes up the same space as 
... would

there are two variants as well, \vphantom who give the same height and 
depth, but no width, and \hphantom, that provide width but no depth or 
height.

Note that none of the phantoms print their argument


At the other end there is \smash, which is like \hphantom, but it also 
prints its argument

Therefore, the length and the tallest glyph do matter for \overline.
