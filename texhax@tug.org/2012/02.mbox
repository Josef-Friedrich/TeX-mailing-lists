Subject: [texhax] Putting tex on a Mac
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1202020919360.29168@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

I got the following email from a friend whom I am collaborating with.  He 
has been using tex from his office and it is apparently an older version, 
or at least a not very complete.  So he decided to install it on his Mac. 
Here is his question:

I have downloaded Mac-tex from ctan ?actually I have it 
on an external hard drive because
it said it would take over 24 hours to download onto my mac in my office. 
But it just sits there, I clicked
on it and it unzipped but nothing happened. Any suggestions? I think I 
will join TUG and ask them.

While joining TUG is a nice idea (and he would get the tex-live disk) the 
answers he needs are available free and I recommended he ask texhax, then 
decided to post the question myself.  I have never used a Mac myself and 
have no idea how it does things.

Howdy,

Are you actually doing this on a Mac? Nothing will ever happen with it on a PC because the .mpkg file is opened and run by Apple's installer. Just double click the .mpkg file on the Mac and then it will get installed. It typically takes less than 5 minutes and should just work out of the box.

Good Luck,

That sounds like a very slow mirror, have you tried a fdifferent mirror

As for the installation see Herberts reply, on the Mac unzip the 
.mpkg.zip file.

Only on Mac does this have type of 'file' have any special meaning. For 
all other OS' it is just a normal folder.

Which type of Mac are we dealing with? (which OS version)

Howdy,

One more thing... if you continue to have a problem with installing via the .mpkg ``file'' on the Mac please report the problem and ask for help at MacTeX-support, <http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/support/emailform/>.

Good Luck,

I would suggest using minimals instead:

If you can be confident that no line-breaking will be required,
you could use any standard technique for determining the width
of the text, then typesetting it \rlapped and overlaid by a
\raised (negatively speaking) box of the same width containing
\leaders of your desired underline style ...

If line-breaking is involved, consider LuaTeX !

  texdoc ulem

It supports line-breaking (but not automatic hyphenation) and works
with LaTeX and plain TeX.

Subject: [texhax] Hyphenation questions
Message-ID: <201202022135.q12LZt0n087368@net.indra.com>

Question #1

I found an English word that TeX (TeXLive 2010, running LaTeX under 
TeXShop on a Mac) wasn't hyphenating correctly (the word was 
"swimmingly").  But since TeX goes to some lengths not to hyphenate words 
during line-breaking of paragraphs, I found it hard to isolate and test 
what was going on.  As opposed to punting by simply adding a 
\hyphenate{swim-ming-ly} exception declaration to my document, which of 
course worked to solve my immediate problem, but didn't tell me much 
about why the word wasn't otherwise being hyphenated right.

Is there a simple macro or testbed file of TeX source code that allows 
one to test any specific word (English or otherwise) to see how TeX/LaTeX 
would hyphenate it in various circumstances?

Question #2

So being of a curious mindset, I tried to understand \patterns, which 
admittedly took me off on a tangent.  It seems that when hyphenation 
patterns are installed before typesetting begins, duplicates (if any) are 
complained about.  But what constitutes a duplicate?  Are the patterns 
"mm1" and "mm3" duplicates?  "mm" and "mm1"?  "mm2" and "mm4"?  I ask 
because there's some tests for duplicate \patterns in "trip.tex" that I 
don't quite understand.  It seems to me that for any given sequence of 
characters, whatever hyphenation "counts" (or whatever we call the digits 
in a pattern) there are shouldn't affect whether the pattern is a 
duplicate or not.

Thx.

simple.  using plain tex from the command line:

  tex
  **\relax
  *\showhyphens{swimmingly}

and yes, that is pretty bad.

i collect bad hyphenations, and publish
addenda to the list periodically in tugboat.
(an installment should appear in the next
issue.)  and whenever an addendum appears
in tugboat, the entire accumulation is
posted to ctan:

  http://www.ctan.com/info/digests/tugboat/hyphenex/

(swimmingly is already on the list; has
been for years.)  feel free to send me any
new exceptions that you stumble on, after
checking the existing list.

I get a 404 on that URL. Perhaps it was mistyped?

I also tried .org, tug.org, ctan.org, and a few other obvious variants.

Barbara, it's good that we're living in the 21st century.  A few
hundred years ago, confusing '.org' with '.com' was regarded as
blasphemy and people making such mistakes (even accidentally) often
ended up in a funeral pyre.

  Reinhard

And if the word you want to test isn't english?  I tried several (portuguese) 
words, but apparently it is trying to use the english way of hyphenating not 
the portuguese one.  How should I indicate that I wanted portuguese 
hyphenation?

Thanks a lot,

er, um, that's the correct one.  thanks, phil.

    Barbara, it's good that we're living in the 21st century.  A few
    hundred years ago, confusing '.org' with '.com' was regarded as
    blasphemy and people making such mistakes (even accidentally) often
    ended up in a funeral pyre.

well, if i end up there, i hope someone will
celebrate by dancing around it, playing a
violin.

(i really *must* learn to be more careful
when i cut-and-paste and then edit ...)

Message-ID: <CADkXsV1rB2=VwZwrrGkWK7ZCvspLAfryfq-aRRerFaTv15jyxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a problem that seems like it should be easy but I can't seem to
figure it out. I want to make a LaTeX document that consists almost
entirely of figures divided into sections. The problem is that the
figures don't want to stay in their sections. I am searching for a way
to force the figures to stay in the section that they are "assigned"
in the .tex file even if it means starting a new page for only a
figure. I thought about using Beamer but I want the output to be
optimized for print not screen. The example below should illustrate my
problem:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\usepackage[landscape]{geometry}

\begin{document}

\section{Test1}
\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
\setlength{\unitlength}{5cm}
\begin{picture}(1,1)
\put(0,0){\line(0,1){1}}
\put(0,0){\line(1,0){1}}
\end{picture}
  \caption{}
\end{figure}




\section{Test2}
% I want all the figures here to stay in this section
\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
\setlength{\unitlength}{5cm}
\begin{picture}(1,1)
\put(0,0){\line(0,1){1}}
\put(0,0){\line(1,0){1}}
\end{picture}
  \caption{}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
\setlength{\unitlength}{10cm}
\begin{picture}(1,1)
\put(0,0){\line(0,1){1}}
\put(0,0){\line(1,0){1}}
\end{picture}
  \caption{}
\end{figure}

\section{Test3}
% Nothing in this section
% And I would like a way to keep this free of figure that came previous
\end{document}

Can any one recommend a good way to do this?

Thanks so much in advance!

\clearpage

just before the next section will force the figures out.

I tried it and it seems to do the trick.

Hello

Try the "placeins"-package.
It let you put a \FloatBarrier in the document, which prevents all
floats from floating past that point.

Hi,

Have you considered placing them (the sections and figures) into  
minipage environments?

Thanks for the suggestion but the \clearpage command did exactly what
I was looking for.

Thanks for all the responses!

Thanks to all for the answers on my first question.

Not being familiar with all the macro names in plain.tex, I didn't know 
about \showhyphens{}.  Ditto for the exceptions list on CTAN.orgcom.

I'd still like to understand what the definition of a duplicate 
hyphenation pattern is, other than "that which causes TeX to issue a 
particular error message".

Your confusion is not unwarranted;

No mention of "duplicate" as far as I can see,
Why not assume that "duplicate" means "identical" ?
It probably does !

    And if the word you want to test isn't english?  

I know you've already been answered, but FWIW ... I have sometimes
wanted to test hyphenation in LaTeX specifically (e.g., to see if all
the babel linkage was working properly).  Here's what I came up with:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[german,english]{babel}
\begin{document}
\hbadness=10000
\def\word{Auszeichnungen}
\selectlanguage{german}\showhyphens{\word}
\selectlanguage{english}\showhyphens{\word}
\end{document}

(Showing it also in English is just for curiousity, and to make sure
that hyphenations which should be different really are. :)

Oh, and I've also sometimes been curious about the hyphenmin settings:
\selectlanguage{german}\showthe\lefthyphenmin\showthe\righthyphenmin

Best,
Karl

    what constitutes a duplicate?

Whatever TeX complains about :)?

    Are the patterns "mm1" and "mm3" duplicates?  "mm" and "mm1"? 
    "mm2" and "mm4"?

I don't know, but you could try giving those as \patterns to initex to
find out.

    I ask because there's some tests for duplicate \patterns in
    "trip.tex" that I don't quite understand.  

Essentially nothing after the first few lines of trip.tex is
understandable, to my mortal eyes :).  Anyway, the only one of the above
combinations I see in trip.tex is bb and bb1, which sounds like a random
edge case anyway -- like most things in trip.
    
    It seems to me that for any given sequence of characters, whatever
    hyphenation "counts" (or whatever we call the digits in a pattern)
    there are shouldn't affect whether the pattern is a duplicate or not.

That sounds logical, but ... trying to follow the code in tex.web,
I cannot easily conclude whether that is the case or not.

Happy sleuthing,
Karl

Hi,
I want to number sections in an article class document as A ,B, C etc, i.e
I want to use alphabets instead pf numbers. How do I change this command I
am now using? I can suppress numbers and type it in. Is there another way?

\section {Significance}

Thanks.

Dear list,

Can someone help me ? I need a Style LaTeX to automatically put the 
first letter of a title in capitals.

Any one have an idea ?

Thanks a lot,

This is called a ``drop cap'' for short (long version would be ``dropped capital'').

The usual package for doing this is lettrine:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{type1cm, lettrine, blindtext}
\begin{document}
\lettrine[lines=3, findent=3pt, nindent=0pt]{O}{n} the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
\end{document}

If you had e.g. to modify the first word in each paragraph, the chickenize package for luaTeX could be helpful. The author, Arno Trautmann, showed really nice examples for luaTeX at the last Dante meeting here in Germany.

I am not at all sure that this statement is correct.  If the first letter of
a title is in capitals (e.g., "This is my title"), there is no suggestion
(to my mind) that the cap. should also be enlarged and dropped.

Oh.

I totally misread that. I really need an app which disables my Send Mail functionality until after I've finished at least one cup of tea.....

Hmm, maybe the issue is a bibliography?

Wouldn't this be handled in a bibtex style then?

Howdy,

And my interpretation of the request is for a macro that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a Title. :-)

Good Luck,

Then they must use "each word" quite different in your part of the world, Herb :-)

In the Deep South (of England), "the first letter of a title" is "the first letter
of a title", not "the first letter of each word of a title" ...

Subject: [texhax] LaTeX to HTML - And HTML email
Message-ID: <201202081742.19252.ghaverla@materialisations.com>

After trying on a very small subset of tools to convert LaTeX to 
HTML, I settled on HeVeA.

I am trying to make a "solution" for all these people who feel 
that HTML email is a multipart/alternative message where the text 
part is 1 or 2 bytes,  and some HTML part is 10k or more, and no 
PDF part.

While there may be mail clients which will use CSS in the <head> 
(which is what HeVeA does), apparently the bulk of email clients 
want the style attribute on all things in the body, and not some 
general CSS in <head>.

Are there LaTeX to HTML convertors that will do this?  Or does a 
person have to transform the HTML to put all the CSS/style in the 
<body>?

You might want to try MailChimp's CSS Inliner tool for this exact purpose.
This tool is free of charge, and you don't need to register with MailChimp
beforehand to use it.

http://beaker.mailchimp.com/inline-css

To use the tool, first copy the CSS <style> into the <head> of your HTML
document. Then copy and paste the _entire_ HTML file into the CSS Inliner
tool. Click "convert", and the tool will then present an e-mail friendly
version.


Hope that helps,

We produced a book in PDF using pdflatex, and sent it to
Lulu.com to print a hardcopy proof.

Days and days later (grrrrrrrrr) we got a message saying
they had a problem with the file and were refunding our
payment.  The only information they provided was
	"RIP error"
and
	"It looks like there's an issue with the fonts in
	your PDF."

pdffonts says (below) that all fonts are embedded, so I
can't think what's wrong.

Has anybody either:
a. successfully printed LaTeX documents with Lulu?  or ...
b. had similar problems?  Solutions?

Some people report success. They usually also want PDF/X-1a. :-(

I guess Lulu's RIP is VERY OLD and doesn't like CID TrueType fonts.

An old (5.0?) version of Acrobat shows most of the fonts as
built in.  The exceptions include "MathPazo", and
"GillSans-Italic" Truetype.  (However, whether this version
of Acrobat displays "embedded" or not for a particular font
depends on whether you have viewed the page containing the
font this session, so the above isn't definitive.)

Otherwise, Acrobat displays the file without any problems.

Recently, I had a book printed without problems with Lulu. The pdf was 
generated with pdfLaTeX from MiKTeX:

The following fonts are embedded (output from pdffonts):

Victor Eijkhout published several books with Lulu.  He might have a

I went looking at CPAN, and surprisingly there is a module there 
(CSS::Inliner) which looks surprisingly the same.  And it sort of 
works.

We've had Lulu.com ship the "same" book to two addresses, one book printed correctly, and the other incorrectly. This happened to us with pdf files made using pdftex (plain TeX not LaTeX) with lots of embedded fonts. The characters in problematic fonts were simply blank in the badly printed books; the file was not rejected. Evidently Lulu.com does not always use equivalent printers or drivers. Solutions might be to avoid unusual fonts, normalize your pdfs somehow, and have all books shipped to your address for quality control inspection before shipping them elsewhere.

Jobbing Printers with fast image setters do not favor TrueType and, in 
my experience are likely to reject it absolutely.  Note that all the 
above fonts are Type1.

Yes, frequently. (Well, actually, I use pdfTeX, but I can't imagine that
LaTeX should be any different from plain TeX insofar as this issue is
concerned.)

> b. had similar problems?  Solutions?

Nope, never. I've published several dozen books (if one includes different
editions of the same book) through Lulu. Never had a problem with fonts.

I typically use Latin Modern fonts, but I've used others. I doubt that I've
ever used any TrueType fonts, though.

Frankly, neither can I. If it's embedded, then it seems to me (someone will
doubtless correct me if I'm wrong) that all the information needed to print
the glyphs should be present in the file.

My experience is that Lulu tech support is typically both slow and
hopeless, but you could try them. Perhaps they've improved.

Could the problem be the duplicate PalatinoLinotypeItalic and GillSans?

The lost character syndrome is very interesting, because it is something 
I have frequently experienced.  Is there any chance that all the lost 
characters belong to the Adobe Expert Encoding set? Dharacter 
disappearance will always happen (so far as I know) in a file produced 
with a non-Adobe distiller.  There is no place in Unicode for most of 
what appears in Adobe Expert Character encoding, and so Adobe has 
basically abandoned it, but not told you about the decision.  If I 
remember correctly, fonts using Adobe Expert Encoding are rendered 
properly in Reader 6, but produce spaces in Reader 7.  What Adobe has  
done is provide a truly Byzantine workaround, but you can only benefit 
from that if you use either Adobe on-line distiller (what I use) or buy 
the grossly overpriced package that gives you the same capabilities in 
the Adobe Acrobat Professional software combination.  (Warning: If you 
do decide to use the Acrobat Professional package, and have occasion to 
change your OS, you are out of luck.  You have to pay the full cost of 
the replacement package all over again.)  Ghostscript provides no 
solutions, and I am afraid I doubt that pdflatex has even thought about 
the problem.

I wish it were that consistent.

BTW, these duplicate entries are harmless but can confuse some
programs though.  I encountered such problems when running pdfsizeopt
on the VnTeX font sample files.  Further investigation showed that
if pdffonts lists different objects for the same font, these objects
don't contain the font file itself but references to a font file and
an encoding vector.

This happens, for instance, if a font file contains Roman and Small
Caps and both are used in a document.  pdfTeX inserts each font only
once but needs different encodings in order to access all glyphs.
This is correct behavior and compliant with the PDF specification.

Obviously pdffonts doesn't follow the link to the actual font.  It
would then notice that both links point to the same font-file object.

As far as pdfsizeopt is concerned, what I don't understand is why it
rejects only some of such files complaining about duplicate fonts,
while its author, Peter Szab?, could compile all files from

  http://vntex.sf.net/fonts/samples

seamlessly on his laptop at EuroTeX 2009 [1].  

Anyway, all other programs (PDF viewers and to-PostScript converters)
I'm aware of, even xpdf itself (from which pdffonts is derived), find
the actual fonts and produce proper output.

And regarding Lulu.com, I'm wondering how one can bother users with
such a stupid and useless error message:

 >>  "It looks like there's an issue with the fonts in your PDF."

It's foreseeable that the hotline runs hot.  Looks like a self made
denial-of-service attack.  Do they still respond to mails?  I can't
imagine.  I'm also wondering how a machine which is only aware of ones
and zeroes can provide an error message containing "It looks like
there's an issue with ...".  Is it that what people call "fuzzy logic"
or is it a first attempt to support what's called "artificial
intelligence"?  Or do they simply use trinary logic, supporting the
states "true", "false", and "dontknow"?

I think that either these packages must be removed or the better solution is
to add the emerald package.

Message-ID: <201202121957.55641.ghaverla@materialisations.com>

I am generating a document where I am encorporating source code 
listings of Perl (with POD) in the document.

The preamble doesn't like printpod=... or podcomment=... at all.  
Neither variable is defined, hence I can't set it, is what I 
gather.

In a section of POD in the code, as soon as a single quote comes 
up, output goes screwy.  Every space becomes that square "U" to 
explicitly show a space. Yes, changing doesn't to does not, and so 
on fixes the problems.

If a rewrite things to avoid single quotes, the biggest thing that 
jumps out is that Perl keywords are still bold in the POD.  Which 
is fine in some places, maybe not so much in others.

Platform is Debian/unstable, with most everything up to date (as 
far as Debian is concerned).

A new language can be defined that sets these entries:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{listings}
\lstdefinelanguage{PodPerl}[]{Perl}{podcomment,printpod}[pod]

\begin{document}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=PodPerl]
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
$^W=1;

my $title = "Hello World";
print $title;
1;

__DATA__

=head1 NAME

My title with ' as single quote.
...

\end{lstlisting}
\end{document}

Also the example above shows the problem.
Perhaps a bug?

If you have a POD section without Perl code, you could use
  deletestring=[b]", deletestring=[b]'

Why would I need to define a new language, if the listing package 
documents the presence of printpod and podcomment variables?

That was my thought.

No, all the POD is within the Perl source.

Double quotes weren't a problem, just regular single quotes.  I 
don't know that setting printpod or podcomment would have fixed 
anything or not, all I know is that trying to set either generated 
errors.  I'm guessing the documentation is out of date with the 
code?

I can completely understand the fact that Perl keywords are bold 
in the POD, as POD is legal Perl.  But LaTeX parsing doesn't seem 
to be up to what the Perl interpretter does.

I would entirely understand if Perl with POD is not something the 
Listings package can do.  A note to that effect is all that is 
needed.  But, manually adjusting the text looks reasonable enough 
for my purposes.

Subject: [texhax] TeX fonts with PDFs
Message-ID: <FB5CA741-C0E0-49C1-916D-B132C72F6478@nasa.gov>

Hi all,

I'm trying to get some information, but the Web hasn't been very helpful, so I'm turning to you guys/gals. 

My co-worker gets PDF files for review from a colleague. The PDFs were created in TeX (from pdfTeX). My coworker wants to change words, etc. in the PDF but keeps getting the error message that he doesn't have the system fonts to do this. He's working in Acrobat Pro X, which allows all kinds of changes to a PDF, but without the fonts, it's a no-go. 

I've tried this on my machine, and I have pdfTeX, so I obviously have the fonts, but I get the same error message. I'm assuming that the TeX fonts are program files and not the type of true type or open type font files that Acrobat is looking for. (All of the documents in question were created with Computer Modern.)

So, I guess my questions to you are:

1. Is it possible to change text in a PDF created from TeX (NOT LaTeX) in Acrobat?

2. Do actual True Type or Open Type font files exist for Computer Modern that can be installed on both PCs and Macs that can be used for this purpose?

Thanks.

Elaine

They're usually Type 1 fonts which are not installed into the system.

Yes, but one needs to create the .pdf so that it uses the core PostScript font set or using system fonts common to both systems (using xetex) or use a specialized plug-in such as Enfocus PitStop.

> 2. Do actual True Type or Open Type font files exist for Computer Modern that can be installed on both PCs and Macs that can be used for this purpose?

One can install OpenType versions of the Computer Modern fonts (or the Type 1 versions) but this has some issues:

 - the OpenType versions aren't as easy to use in TeX (maybe not as capable either --- I don't think they have the math tables)
 - the OpenType / Type 1 versions clutter up most system font menus to the point that most users complain loudly and remove them

Two days ago there was something from "brito at dmat.ufpe.br" about
missing transparency in a pstricks-drawing. It is well known that
pstricks has problems to be generated  via pdflatex.

In the end I did run the tex-file (latex main (renamed)) and got
main.ps via dvips.

The transparency was kept when I used freePDF.exe to gain the pdf-file.

I don't think that the missing transparency was a result of
ghostscript (as freePDF.exe uses ghostscript also).

Hi,

I'm working on my thesis.  A common pattern has emerged: I make a
claim, I support the claim, repeat.  I'd like to create a summary
document, which includes the claims and an enumeration of the
arguments, but without all of the rationale.  I want to develop this
document inline, so it is easy to keep both consistent, if I, e.g.,
move text around.  I could imagine using a macro to indicate what text
is for the summary document, but I don't want to use a macro for the
rest of the text, because this will clutter the document.  I guess
this is possible, because it is essentially what the "List of Figures"
is.  Is there a package to help me with this?

Thanks,

Neal

I don't know of a package to do exactly what you're asking about, but I would be interested in having this functionality too if someone has an idea.

One thing that occurred to me is to use the 'todonotes' package with the lines/colors set to "white", like in the example below.  It's not as good as having a package that could create a 'summary' only document with the full formatting intact.




\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{geometry, blindtext}                
\usepackage[color=white,linecolor=white,bordercolor=white]{todonotes}
\title{Brief Article}
\author{The Author}
\begin{document}

\maketitle
%\section{}
%\subsection{}
\listoftodos[Summary Comments (from ToDo Package)]
\begin{center}
\line(1,0){290}
\end{center}

\blindtext
\todo[inline]{Here is some text.  This will show up in the todo notes list above asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf  asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf} asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf
\todo[inline]{Here is another statement that will go in the summary document.  asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf}
\blinddocument
\todo[inline]{Last comment goes here - \blindtext}

\end{document}

Here's an earlier post of mine that shows how you can do
what you want very easily.  In your case you could use

	#ifdef SUMMARY
	<summary-only stuff>
	#else
	<full-document-only stuff>
	#endif
	<stuff common to both>

Niall

We had a related requirement -- how to produce two different
versions of a book from the same source files.  We tried
(La)TeX-specific approaches but abandoned these because the
syntax was too messy and it was too hard (for us at least)
to make sure that the conditional code was handled
correctly, and not changed by the if/else mechanism and that
we wouldn't have to worry about when expressions were
evaluated, escaped, etc.

So instead we pre-process the LaTeX files:

- source file is, say, simple.texpp
  (where 'pp' stands for 'preprocessor').

- use 'unifdef' to handle the conditionals.  unifdef is
  very basic which is great -- it leaves just about
  everything completely untouched apart from handling
  if/else.  Here's an example:

	\documentclass[12pt]{article}
	\begin{document}

	First
	#ifdef MME
	Second
	Third
	#else
	Fourth
	Fifth
	#endif
	Sixth
	\end{document}

  If we are producing the "mass market edition" (MME) we get
  one output tex file; on the other hand if MME is undefined we get a
  different variant -- the "normal" version of the book.

  We send the output of unifdef to simple.tex in this
  example, which we then process as normal.

- A full example, with Makefile, is at

	http://uit.co.uk/files/tex-and-latex/unifdef-example.tgz

  (size is 0.5K).

	Regards,
	Niall

I once wrote a tiny .sty file that would write text out to a file of my
choosing. There is a similar capability in the moreverb package (an
environment called verbatimwrite), but I think that doesn't accumulate
text as it closes the output file immediately. Mine will keep it open
until the latex job is complete.

I attach my outfile.sty, which is a hack of a colleague's code which was
a hack of something else, probably the toc code in latex. In your case,
if I've understood what you want to do, you'll need a command that will
both typeset your material and also write it out to a file. Here's the
idea (untested). If what you write into the summary has lots of commands
or other things, you may need to \protect the contents or modify
the .sty and your usage. I'm sure this could be developed to be a lot
better and more robust.

To use, in mythesis.tex:
\documentclass{....}
...
\usepackage{outfile}
\newcommand\summarybits[1]{%
\addtocontents{mysummary}{#1}%  writes out argument
#1%    and typesets it as well
}
...
\begin{document}
\outfile{mysummary}   % will create and open a file mythesis.mysummary
blah blah
\addtocontents{mysummary}{Summary of Claims}  %for summary file only
\summarybits{This will get copied into mythesis.mysummary AND typeset
here}
more blah blah
...
\end{document}

I guess you could use \outfile{mysummary.tex} and use
\addtocontents{mysummary.tex} to write out a preamble and other
formatting for mythesis.mysummary.tex, which would then be a standalone
latex document derived from your mythesis.tex. [I used outfile.sty to
write out an html document.]

I am new to latex. Using lyx to format documents composed in Scrivener and exported to latex. I've encountered difficulties compiling to pdflatex, with which I've gotten help from the lyx listserv. 

I have a 35 page document that I've set to use nonlatex fonts in lyx that I  compile to pdf with xetex. Initially I had a lot of out-of-margin characters. At the suggestion of putting the following code into my lyx preamble solved most of the problems, though not all:

\tolerance 1414
\hbadness 1414
\emergencystretch 1.5em
\hfuzz 0.3pt
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{url} 

However

I have the mactex distribution of tex/latex. I am wondering if there are addition tex fonts that I could install that would [1] allow me to compile to pdf with latex, and [2] make it easier for latex to avoid out-of-margin characters.

Thanks,

If you're willing to believe the tool works, or have some other validator to use, no Acrobat Pro is necessary.

Answered my own question, at least regarding fonts. [Discovered the tex gyre fonts.] Not certain they'll solve the problems I've been experiencing compiling to pdf, though. We'll see.

FWIW, I just read in an article from Claudio (Beccari) that this is not
a reliable way to perform the check.  I trust Claudio won't mind if I
quote his paragraph:

  Of course the last step is to check PDF/A compliance with a reliable
  program, such as Preflight. Please do not trust the information issued
  by Adobe Reader~X when it opens a PDF file that pretends to be
  PDF/A-compliant. The information is a wish, in the sense that the
  statement might be true, but the document has not been really tested in
  every remote corner of its compliance. So the real message should not
  be: ``This file is PDF/A compliant'', but: ``This file might be PDF/A
  compliant''.

Unfortunately, neither Claudio nor I are aware of any free software tool
(e.g., Ghostscript-based) that can test compliance.  If anyone else is,
we'd love to know.

I wouldn't know PDF/A if I tripped over it.  But, StackOverflow 
was asked about PDF/A back in 2009, and someone who responded from 
France (worked at the French National Library) pointed out JHOVE 
at Harvard.  It's a Java application.

http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/

I don't know if that is what you're looking for.

Yes, these parameters can be tweaked individually, but if you are a beginner
or intermediate use I recommend simply "\sloppy", which is LaTeX's encapsulation
of settings to prevent "overfull hbox in paragraph" errors.  You don't mention
your language settings for hyphenation of words, and that may be the critical 
problem.  Both the tolerances and the hyphenation are subjects in the UKtug

Thanks for the references, Don. Unfortunately, my newbieness is so new the implications are a bit hazy.

A FAQ on how hyphenation works linked to from the second link above has this: "The ordinary LaTeX user need not worry about \language, since it is very thoroughly managed by the babelpackage; use of \hyphenation is discussed in the context of hyphenation failure." 

The page on hyphenation failure alludes to a possible need to install new hyphenation patterns. I have the MacTeX version of TeX Live. If American English is my language, is it likely that I need to be concerned about having the wrong hyphenation rules specified?

It also says this: "The \hyphenation command allows you to give explicit instructions." I'm taking it this would be to a specific instance of hyphenation failure?

Finally, would I use "\sloppy" in place of the commands listed above or in addition to them.   

Thanks again,

Adobe Acrobat Professional 8.0 is not free, and should be able to adequately check on PDF/A compliance --- if it isn't, upgrade to Adobe Acrobat X Pro:

http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro/acrobatpro_b.html

and if you find a .pdf which claims to be PDF/A, is accepted as such by Adobe Acrobat X Pro, but really isn't fully conformant, file a bug report.

Howdy,

You should not have any hyphenation problems with American English. It also has nothing to do with the Mac since MacTeX installs a standard, full TeX Live.

Is there any way you could supply a minimal but compilable sample file that demonstrates your problem? 

Good Luck,

Hi Neal

There are two choices available:

* one doc with a switch to flip

* two docs with includes

** one doc with switch
You may be able to get what you want with the 
\includeonly
or
\excludeonly

http://clt.mq.edu.au/~rdale/resources/writingnotes/latexstruct.html

notes: usage requires 
1. processing the complete document
2. saving the output as MyDoc-long
3. editing
4. processing with the include
5. saving the output as MyDoc-short

benefits: page numbering is same in both documents


** two docs with input

- - - MyDoc-long.tex
%etc
\begin{document}
\input(MyDoc-claim1)
\input(MyDoc-claim1-rationale)

\input(MyDoc-claim2)
\input(MyDoc-claim2-rationale)
\end{document}

- - - MyDoc-short.tex
%etc
\begin{document}
\input(MyDoc-claim1)
%\input(MyDoc-claim1-rationale)

\input(MyDoc-claim2)
%\input(MyDoc-claim2-rationale)
\end{document}

summary: two complete documents, with differing number of pages

Alternative with the same result, but with three documents, two of which
will *not* be touched after first creation, even when adding new claims and
rationales:

------- MyDoc-long.tex    <--- run latex with this to generate whole document
\newcommand{\claim}[1]{\input{#1}}
\newcommand{\rationale}[1]{\input{#1}}
\input{MyDoc}
------- MyDoc-short.tex   <--- run latex with this to generate short document
\newcommand{\claim}[1]{\input{#1}}
\newcommand{\rationale}[1]{}
\input{MyDoc}
------- MyDoc.tex         <--- this one will be edited
\documentclass{...}
...
\begin{document}
\claim{MyDoc-claim1}
\rationale{MyDoc-claim1-rationale}

\claim{MyDoc-claim2}
\rationale{MyDoc-claim2-rationale}
...
\end{document}
-------


Another version, allowing for keeping claim and rationale in the same
(sub-)document, using an environment for the rationale. Except from that,
the same usage as above:

------- MyDoc-long.tex    <--- run latex with this to generate whole document
% take enclosed material as is:
\newenvironment{rationale}{}{}
\input{MyDoc}
------- MyDoc-short.tex   <--- run latex with this to generate short document
% after working through enclosed material, throw it away:
\newenvironment{rationale}{\begingroup\setbox2=\vbox\bgroup}{\egroup\setbox2=\hbox{}\endgroup}
\input{MyDoc}
------- MyDoc.tex         <--- this one will be edited
\documentclass{...}
...
\begin{document}
claim 1
\begin{rationale}
rationale 1
\end{rationale}

claim 2
\begin{rationale}
rationale 2
\end{rationale}
...
\end{document}
-------

This way you still *can* create files per rationale (makes editing and
reordering much easier), but you need not. And you can keep claim and
rationale together in one document.

I have to admit I do not completely understand how the rationale
environment does what it does. I copied the idea from songbook.sty (see
CTAN) and use it a lot. Maybe the \begingroup and \endgroup are
unnessessary. If so, I hope one of those more familiar with TeX internals
will chime in.

I would recommend creating a command (common or different between the two
documents) for typesetting the claim too, to make sure they are always
typeset in the same way thoughout the whole document. Common formatting for
the rationale can be included in the rationale environment definition in
the MyDoc-long.tex file.

Hope that helps,

	Susan

Thanks, Herb. I assumed that was the case, but the FAQ pages referenced made me wonder.

I'm attaching a copy of the file that gave me the most problems. Compiled with xetex without the tweaking code in the preamble I count  twelve out-of-margin instances. With the tweaks there is only one, and it's a url.

I've discovered the tex gyre family of fonts. Is it possible that using those I would have fewer problems? [I'm interested in them for another reason as well: I compose in Scrivener, export to latex, and format with LyX. Currently with that rough workflow I am not able to compile with latex. Get errors that suggest the file is not UTF8 when it is. This is a LyX problem.]

BachoTeX 2012: Call for Papers

Twenty years after (http://gust.org.pl/bachotex/2012)
==================
2012 is a celebration year for GUST: we will be celebrating the
twentieth GUST anniversary and, not incidentally, the twentieth
BachoTeX. A lot did happen across the century and millennium
borders since founding GUST in 1992 followed by the first
BachoTeX in 1993. A lot in terms of both information technology
progress in general and TeX-with-friends in particular.

The world has changed and TeXies have changed. Or have they? So
many of them were comming to BachoTeXs ? wouldn't it be nice to
meet them again and find out how are they and what they are
doing? We thought so, thus two goals have been set for this
year's BachoTeX:

   * first ? the bread-and-butter TeX and TeX-and-friends stuff
   * second and last but not least ? to get as many as possible
     former BachoTeX participants for a reunion (this is not to say
     that newcomers are not welcome...)

This is serious: please help to spread the word by finding and
inviting your friends whom you remember seeing at one of our
conferences.

To cater for the conference title: we plan a small, special
session plus a corner somewhere devoted to the history of the
conference: any ideas? Think of gadgets, photographs, anecdotes,
presentations, recordings, whatever... And ? any thoughts as to
why we are still around?

Papers/presentations
====================
And now the conference content proper: we look forward to the
normal mix of TeX, METAPOST, ConTeXt, LaTeX, and friends related
presentations (please not not forget about fonts). There is also
the emerging BachoTeX trend of looking for a coming-together of
programmers and designers of typographic systems, typographers
and other users of such systems, so papers and activities in that
area are also most welcome. Please note the ?Call for TeX Pearls?
further down.

The normal channel of offering papers is the emailing of
proposals to the Program Committee, but before rushing off to the
mailer, please consult the info for authors.

Workshops and tutorials
=======================
Especially welcome are proposals for TeX-related tutorials or
introductions. If you have suggestions for tutorials or workshops
by others than yourself or about specific topics, please let us
know.

Poster sessions
===============
Participants will be given the opportunity to present their TeX
and typographic results in the form of posters for which we
provide exhibition space.

Call for TeX Pearls
===================
We continue the tradition of the ?Pearls of TeX Programming?.
Details and previously collected pearls can be found at
http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls/.

The TeX Clinic
==============
We hope that more advanced TeXies will help out the TeX Clinic
team led by Joanna Ry?ko. We'd like to continue the initiative
with the aim to draw in TeX beginners.

Deadlines and addresses
=======================
The deadline for abstracts and other proposals is March 28th
2012. The deadline for final papers to appear in the conference
materials is April 11th.

Contributions should be send by email to the Program Committee:
prog-2012 at gust dot org dot pl. The PC is chaired by Bogus?aw
Jackowski (b underscore jackowski at gust dot org dot pl).

Since BibLaTeX is a real show-stopper I'm wondering why such a mailing
list doesn't exist already.

However, it's up to Philipp Lehmann to establish one.  Please ask him.
I'm sure that he gets the necessary support from TUG if he is
interested.

BibLaTeX is currently discussed in several newsgroups and certainly on
stackexchange too.  I must admit that if I'm interested in a
particular program very much, I prefer mailing lists to anything else.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    Subject: [texhax] Is there a biblatex listserv?

Although it hasn't been used much, there is biblio at tug.org
(http://lists.tug.org/biblio) for any kind of TeX bibliography
discussion.  As I recall, when we set up the list a couple years ago, we
thought it would be fine for biblatex issues to be brought up there.  I
think Philipp was in on that discussion.

If there turns out to be tons of biblatex traffic, it would be easy to
set up biblatex at tug.org.  I infer from what I read in the biblatex
manual that Philipp intentionally chose not to set up a mailing list in 
his sourceforge project, or wherever.

Best,
Karl

Try <http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/texshop.html>

You will presumably need also a TeX distribution.  Instructions are found in the "Obtaining" link at the top of the page.

In that case getting TeXShop is rather irrelevant, since it is already

Howdy,

True... but given the original request I'd guess that installing the GUI apps was NOT turned off. More likely, there is a disconnect between TeXShop and a full TeX Distribution as installed by the MacTeX installer package.

Good Luck,

Subject: [texhax] framed.sty -- "open" frame across page break
Message-ID: <E1S2R8T-00056m-37@mail.uit.co.uk>

I want to typset several paragraphs in a frame -- because
they are not part of the main text.  If I used 'framed.sty',
when the material breaks across a page, the frame is closed
at the bottom of this page, and at the start of the next.
This makes it look like two separate things, rather than a
single one breaking across a page.

Is there any way to make the frame "open" at the bottom of
the first page, and at the top of the next (or is there
another suitable package)?  I.e. so it looks like:

+---+
|   |
|   |

<page break>

|   |
|   |
+---+

and not

+---+
|   |
|   |
+---+

<page break>

+---+
|   |
|   |
+---+


	Thanks,
	Niall

use the mdframed package

it is IMO a lot easier to use

Hi there,

I'll give a LaTeX tutorial next week and will have a blind participant who
will bring a 40-line Braille reader.

Can anyone give me hints how to TeX best if one cannot see the results? Are
there packages aiding in finding bugs? Any editors that are preferable in
comparison to  others?

Hi,
try
http://vinuxproject.org/
and
http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/
But I guess it's not an easy task to set it up correctly.
The author of emacsspeak is visual impaired and might have a lot of more
tricks and ideas on his website.
All the best

We've had a bit of discussion about this in the past (well worth searching the archives for ``Braille'', ``visually impaired'' and ``blind''). From my notes on it:

Major Issue:

 - portions of math equations / rules being rendered as graphic elements, not as text characters so that they were invisible to screen readers

Key here would be to use LaTeX markup which includes explicit use of Unicode code points (so as to help screen readers) and has as well, especial support for annotations (i.e., alt-text for [tagged] .pdfs --- pdftex command is \pdfliteral, then use /ActualText ) 

Of course, there is a bit of irony here, in that the TeX source is used as the alt text for many graphic representation of equations on the web, most notably at Adobe's Opensource site.

Other technologies / techniques:

 - Aster, a TeX-math reader: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html

 - speech and Braille out of MathML: http://www.daisy.org/projects/mathml/

 - Nemeth, a special notation / extension for math: http://www.rit.edu/~easi/itd/itdv01n4/article8.htm
   http://www.tsbvi.edu/math/nemeth-trans.htm
   http://mathforum.org/library/view/60901.html

 - http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/ --- some files in this are explicitly used for speech support as noted by Victor Ivrii

The key today is to produce tagged pdf.
