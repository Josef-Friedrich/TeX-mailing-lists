Steve,

thanks for your help. I checked the latex class and there are some nice
features which I would like to take over into my layout. Thanks for sharing
it with me.

Hi Alan,
Hi John,

as you both suggest, I looked into exam. Since time is running a bit, I
gave this a try over starting with an own solution. I think I got pretty
much what I want. Only one feature is missing.
I would like to generate a point-table which includes sub-questions.
E.g.
Question   Points
1.                50
   a              10
   b              20
   c              20
   d              10
2.                50
   a              25




Thus, question 1 gives in total 50 points, but I want to add the
sub-questions too, to allow me to get all together into a single table.


Any idea?

Thanks Torsten

Subject: [texhax] Web Forum type package?
Message-ID: <201307021734.09869.ghaverla@materialisations.com>

I am going to "edit" a couple of web forum threads that are 
related, and while I haven't looked at the raw HTML yet, I really 
doubt I can write Perl to parse the so called structure to write 
LaTeX.  So, a lot of cut and paste is probably needed, which you 
don't need to know about.  :-)

But, is there some CTAN package (which works with hyperref) that 
approximates the structure of a thread (or parallel threads) in a 
web forum?  Something vaguely like a what a threaded email  client 
or newsreader might display, if asked to print all the messages in 
a thread?

Thanks.
Gord

Hi Torsten

I've created a lot of exams using only the article class, and a lot of customisation w.r.t. "\newcommand".

Will send some samples when I get home.

Subject: [texhax] Creating Exams with LaTeX?!

Hi,

I was wondering if there is any preferred method (class) to create written exams with LaTeX.
My exams consist basically only of two large exercises with subitems.
Sometimes I would need a graphic and there is need for equations.
There are about 100-150 subscribers for a single exam.

I checked on CTAN and there are some packages. I simply wonder which one is in common use, or which one is more or less obsolete.

Furthermore, I would like to introduce some automatism which makes it easier for me to rate the exams later. E.g. I was thinking to ask students to fill in the answers in allocated spaces.
Another idea would be some automation to create solution sheets, point and mark tables, etc.

I am aware that I might not be able to achieve the last ideas with pure LaTeX. Thus, I am happy to hear what other method you use for this task. E.g. I thought about using org-mode on emacs to create a metasystem which enables me to keep all (exam, evaluation, scoring, solution sheet, etc.) in one file but to generate exam sheets from it.

Thanks for comments, solutions and ideas

Torsten

I've had good luck with the exam class.  It does everything I need, and more.  I don't know about a "standard" but I know it is widely used because I see questions about how to customize it.

    any way to get round TeX's complain?  To, say, create room for

1) Use luatex or xetex.
2) Deallocate/allocate families in between formulas as needed.

If you search for something like 
  more than 16 math families tex
you'll get a bunch more q&a's on this topic.

Hope this helps,

Though it wouldn't help much of one is using old math primitives,
\mathcode etc., as they won't be able to use the higher math families
anyway.

Perhaps this can be straightened out by the parties discussing it on
texhax?  The person who uploaded and changed the package ought to at
least identify themselves ... and they should recognize that Hendri is
still doing a great job of updating powerdot.

The way to "get round" it is to assign some dynamically, locally
within the math, rather than globally.

I'm not sure which TeX extensions have more families... XeTeX? LuaTeX?

Is it not the case, Donald (and I ask this from memory, so
may well be mistaken) that maths families are evaluated
only at the very end of the maths formula, so locally-
defined families would have to be encapsulated in non-maths
lists such as hboxes, vboxes, etc ?  If this is indeed the
case, then introducing such non-maths lists into a formula
may well have accompanying (and undesirable) effects on the
latter's spacing.

Hi Thomas,

thanks for the nice words and suggestion. This has already been
discussed with ctan. The person is known to ctan, ctan promissed to
talk to the person, and ctan admitted that there were flaws in their
author-checking-system in the past, allowing for this situation. The
situation should get better after this. It will "just" cost me a
holiday.

I appreciate your feedback of course, but I think it's best to
continue this discussion off-list, if any further contact is needed,
as the list is more for user-questions. Thanks already.

Best regards,
-Hendri.

Message-ID: <20130709235714.GA27278@FR-W-C132678.ncifcrf.gov>

I got the DVD for TeX Collection 2013 today and started installing it
on my Mac OS X 10.6.8 system.

It seems much more complex than previous installations, with three
unequal parts!  This is confusing.

I accidently did that A4 part and so had to start over again.
I did this by moving the /usr/local/texlive/2013
directory to /tmp.

I found that latex was no longer in my path and so I followed:

 Most importantly, add /usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-darwin
 to your PATH for current and future sessions.

This was not required previously.  It's not a good idea to have to change
the path every year!

I still don't find latex in my path.

I discovered that the /usr/local/texlive/2013 directory was not permitted
to be readable by everyone as it had in prevous years:

toot 8% cd texlive/
toot 9% ls
2009/        2010/        2011/        2012/        2013/        texmf-local/
toot 10% dir
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   8 root  wheel  272 Jul  9 17:12 ./
drwxr-xr-x  11 root  wheel  374 Sep  4  2011 ../
drwxr-xr-x  21 root  wheel  714 Nov  7  2009 2009/
drwxr-xr-x  24 root  wheel  816 Mar  5  2011 2010/
drwxr-xr-x  23 root  wheel  782 Sep 20  2011 2011/
drwxr-xr-x  23 root  wheel  782 Aug 23  2012 2012/
drwx------  20 root  wheel  680 Jul  9 17:42 2013/
drwxr-xr-x   9 root  wheel  306 Jan 19  2010 texmf-local/

I fixed that and still got no latex, other things were not permitted.

So I did a recursive permission to the entire directory:

sudo chmod -R a+rX 2013

NOW I have a latex!!!

I'm glad to report that it works and I got my test document.

The log file begins:

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.5-1.40.14 (TeX Live 2013) (format=latex 2013.7.9)  9 JUL 2013 19:54
entering extended mode

So the general solution appears to be that people must do this:

cd /usr/local/texlive
sudo chmod -R a+rX 2013

This might be required for everyone on Unix systems ...

This can be changed later.  No need to install again.

It was always required previously, given that you installed TeX Live.
I suppose that you installed MacTeX in the past.

 > It's not a good idea to have to change the path every year!

TeX Live supports many systems and there is no common way to adjust
PATH for all of them.

If you're on OS/X, install MacTeX instead of TeX Live.

It is more complicated than that. some aspects need to be known
as the math list is read, so each fam needs to be assigned before
use and must persist to the end.

> so locally-defined families

OK, I was speaking of local to a formula, but not local to a portion
within the formula.  If you need more than 16 families in a single
formula, you are out of luck, or portions...

> would have to be encapsulated in non-maths
> lists such as hboxes, vboxes, etc

That brings up a complication I missed though: You can't use TeX
grouping to ensure locality, because sub-formulas are in groups
and so truly local assignments won't persist until the end of the
math.  An on-demand assignment implementation would have to use
messy global assignments and manual forgetting.

Thanks.  But how do I `Deallocate/allocate families in between formulas as
needed'?

And, excuse my poor English, but what does `you'll get a bunch more q&a's on
this topic' mean?

Hmm.  Well apparently it works now given that I fixed the permissions
by hand.  I located the FixMacTeX2013 package:

/Applications/TeX/What Is Installed.pdf
/Applications/TeX/FixMacTeX2013.pkg

But the What only says "FixMacTeX2013 is a small install package which
can fix problems which occasionally occur when a system containing
MacTeX is upgraded to a later version of the operating system." which
doesn't tell me what it does exactly and the pkg itself is binary.  So
I hesitate to run it.  It would be nice to have it be a text script so
that people could see what it does.

Folks:

I did a completely fresh install on a laptop which has Mac OS X 10.6.8
and found the same problem as before: the 2013 directory in
/usr/local/texlive is not permitted for all users.

Again, I did:

   cd /usr/local/texlive
   sudo chmod -R a+rX 2013

and now LaTeX runs fine.

I'm attaching a small script that checks for this problem and corrects
it using the above code.

Maybe your umask (after sudo) is 700?

TL installation intentionally does not force any particular permissions.
The idea is that you should be in control of permissions, not the
installer.  Of course it's still troublesome that you got this result
after going through the normal MacTeX installation.  It should at least
be anticipated in the doc.

    cd /usr/local/texlive
    sudo chmod -R a+rX 2013

Indeed, that is the thing to do if the directory ends up installed as
unreadable :(.

    This might be required for everyone on Unix systems ...

Certainly not everyone (e.g., I installed on Unix, and I didn't need to
do it).  I believe it will happen to people who install (a) as root, and
(b) with a very restrictive umask.  I think that is unfortunately common
(standard?) on Macs, but not elsewhere.

I don't imagine so.  However, it seems to me it possibly could be wrapped

I had indicated during installation, I think, that the installation
should be for everybody on the computer.  So 'chmod -R a+rX 2013'
would be needed for any Unix machine and I would think it appropriate.

It maybe that this is a 10.6.8 and 10.7.5 problem.  (I'm not upgrading
to 10.8 because I would hate to lose Spaces/Expose, see
http://users.fred.net/tds//appleflaws.html.)

Message-ID: <1DDC3015-FE01-4E51-8CA3-1A4DD8EB9647@math.uoregon.edu>

Folks,

I made the MacTeX installer and made the MacTeX
install package for this year's DVD. This thread about MacTeX contained some
misinformation about that package, although Thomas Schneider
and Karl Berry eventually uncovered the true situation.
Let me give further information about this year's MacTeX.

MacTeX is created using Apple's PackageMaker software. This makes
it possible to create a package where just a few clicks install and configure
everything. Such an install package done as Apple intended would contain
its own copy of TeX Live, vastly increasing the space requirements for the DVD.

So over the past few years we "shoehorned" an install via the TeX Live
install script into the package, so the copy of TeX Live already on the DVD
could be used for the Mac as well. Since Apple's installer wasn't really designed
to handle that, there were disadvantages. The main one was a 20 minute period
with NO USER FEEDBACK while TeX Live installed.

This year we did things correctly (in my opinion). Notice that the
MacTeX installed from this year's DVD should behave exactly as
it has behaved in the past. Applications will find TeX
at /usr/texbin as in the past, the PATH for shells will be set up
automatically, and users don't need to change any permissions.
Software should work immediately without configuration.

Before pressing the DVD, I installed MacTeX from a test DVD
on every system we support: Leopard, Snow Leopard, Lion,
Mountain Lion, and after the beta appeared, even Mavericks.
I never ran into permission problems or any other problem.

Let me explain first what is supposed to happen. This year's DVD
installation is divided into three parts. In the first part, users are told
to copy the following lines into Terminal and press RETURN:

	cd /Volumes/TEXCOL2013/texlive
	sudo ./install-tl --profile /Volumes/TEXCOL2013/
              mactex/MacTeX-Install/TLprofiles/texlive.profile

This causes TeX Live to install from the DVD without asking
any questions. The instructions for Part 1 of the install 
say:

"TeX Live will install without further ado. At the end, some 
information will be printed in Terminal, but this information 
can be ignored. When this stage is complete, double click 
the `MacTeX Install Part 2' install package to continue 
installation."

Part 2 is a Mac install package which works exactly as in the
past, except that it doesn't need to install TeX Live. It is important
to run Part 2 immediately because it sets up the TeX Distribution
Data Structure, sets PATHS appropriately, etc. TeX Live will not
user /usr/texbin until this is done.

Part 3 is optional for users with older systems who cannot run
the latest versions of various front ends.

--------------------------

Now on to the problem reported by Thomas Schneider. Schneider
followed the instruction 

"Most importantly, add /usr/local/texlive/2013/bin/x86_64-darwin
to your PATH for current and future sessions"

at the end of the TeX Live install script. This should not be done
on the Mac; we say "At the end, some information will be
printed in Terminal but this information can be ignored."

But the main problem Schneider ran into is incorrect permissions on the
2013 directory. We never saw that problem when running the install
during the test phase. Eventually in this thread, Karl conjectured that
the problem was caused by a restrictive sudo umask, and Schneider
confirmed that. It would be interesting to know where that mask
came from.

Last year we ran into a similar problem; users of the HomeBrew
system are told to give /usr/local the permissions 

	drwx------

The original form of this year's installer FIXED these permissions.
Later I was convinced not to do this. The reasoning is that casual
Mac users will get default values of permissions and everything just
works. If the permissions were changed, the change may have been
done for a reason, so those users should be familiar with consequences
and handle them accordingly.

It is difficult to satisfy both sides of this cultural divide, and next
year's install package will most likely not try to fix permissions which
users have changed via the Home Brew recommendations or possessing
unusual umasks.

I missed the bit about NOT following some instructions, but adding
that to my path didn't help so I removed it.

I had the same problem on four different systems, 10.6.8 and a 10.7.

As far as I know in every case I the entire install in each case. 
Having done so I could not get access to latex from the command line
of a fresh terminal.  As you know, the reason wasn't the path, it was
the permissions.

Oh well, I followed it.  But I don't use TeXShop anyway, I use vim and
trigger a script to do the typesetting using my atchange program.  I
use Skim to display.  This gives me a very big terminal to edit in,
efficient editing (in vim) AND I get the typeset version shown
immediately without taking my hands off the keyboard.  (I map ',' to
mean to write the file out and atchange triggers on the file change).

They are all drwxr-xr-x.

As we found in previous emails, when I am sudo the permissions are:

% sudo umask -S
u=rwx,g=,o=

So any files are set that way.  I didn't set the sudo mask.  It must
be somewhere in the OS and it must be a standard Mac setting.

Yup, home brew seems to be unrelated to the problem.

Thanks for looking into this.

All of my 5 systems are now installed.  In each case latex was
inaccessible after the TexLive install but after I did the recursive
chmod:

   cd /usr/local/texlive
   sudo chmod -R a+rX 2013

they all run fine.

I don't have the DVD with me so can't check right now, but maybe the
permissions in the files there are disallowing group and other?

This seems really weird to me.  The OWNER of /usr/local is of course
root.  So if you have these permissions, a normal user cannot read the
files.  That's why I could not access latex.  The owner of /usr SHOULD
BE ROOT as far as I understand it because to make it any other user
would be a big security hole.  So then the permissions HAVE to be
drwxr-xr-x.  Indeed, for example, the permissions on /etc are:

drwxr-xr-x  121 root  wheel    4114 Jul 10 10:51 ./

on uname Darwin (Mac OS X), and on a FreeBSD (Linux) it is:

drwxr-xr-x  18 root  wheel       2048 Apr 12 10:35 ./

Same thing with /usr on Linux.

I don't see how ALLOWING reading could cause any problems to any
program such as HomeBrew - HomeBrew should not care that someone else
is able to read the files.  If HomeBrew is making /usr owned by a user
then it's a terrible program because it is highly insecure, in my
understanding.  (I'm open to correction of course.)

I don't know.  Did you try running latex from the command line?

What are YOUR permission settings after installation?

Oh!  I use tcsh, maybe the settings for that are different??  Maybe
root inherited my umask?  When I create a fresh directory it is given:

drwx------

So if my umask is passed on to sudo that would explain it.

My personaly settings should not affect something installed into the
system though!

If people want to use HomeBrew, then they ought to be able to run an
extra script to handle things their way.  Most people probably do not
use HomeBrew so most people should not have to deal with the
permissions.

Seems to me that you can do what I did - make a script that sets the
permissions as needed according to different situations.  However I
can't imagine why anyone would want drwx------ for things in /usr.

Ok, but why make things MORE restrictive in /usr/local?  That doesn't

It's tight a complete and tight notation.  It is not easy to guess

particular subject and only 3 days ago I hit on the right terms and
found a jackpot, an incredible paper which discusses exactly what I'd
been looking for.  Without the right terms one can fumble around

They are giving bad advice there.  Doing things as root is NOT a bad
idea.  One should just be careful and not mess up the operating
system.  Making part of the OS owned by a particular user IS a bad
idea because it's a security hole and other users don't have access. 
Is you WANT them to have access then you leave permissions as
drwxr-xr-x!!!

Changing ownership to a single user is lazy and insecure and causes
problems.

> However, perhaps Home Brew is a red herring

It IS!!!

Your system doesn't make sure that the permissions on
/usr/local/texlive are set to drwxr-xr-x.

No, it could have picked it up from my tcsh (not 'tsch'!) environment.

No, it is still a possibility.

So if you, as a user, create a directory:

what do you get?

I got this:

My current understanding is that the final set up ought to be root
ownership of /usr/local with permissions drwxr-xr-x.  That allows only
root to change things but everyone on the system can read and execute
them.  This is, as I understand it, secure.

I found that in my shell start up script I have:

umask 077

That means that when I create files, I have rwx permissions and nobody
else can read, write or execute them.  That is, my files are private:
drwx------.  I think this is a reasonable security precaution.

When I installed TexLive 2013, sudo inherited the 077 mask from my
environment.  Subtracting this from 777 gives 700, which is the
drwx------ permissions observed.  I have confirmed this by creating
some directories and files using sudo with different umask settings
set while not being sudo.

As I've said, I think that /usr/local ought to stay owned by root for
security purposes.  The permissions should allow root to read, write
and execute and others should only be able to read and execute.  That
is, drwxr-xr-x or 755.  Subtracting this from 777 gives 022.

So I currently suggest that you add to the beginning of install
scripts:

  umask 022

Corrections to this are welcome!

Howdy,

That actually makes me feel better! At least we know that the problem isn't widespread.

I suggest that next year we simply have a script for Part 1 that allows the user to choose between letter and a4 paper default, sets `umask 022` as suggested by Thomas, and then chooses the correct install procedure for the given default paper type. That way we just ask folks to run a single script and answer one question. It would even be better is it was all wrapped in a gui app that displayed a console window so the user could follow along and see that something was happening.

Good Luck,

This is certainly reasonable, but definitely not the only reasonable choice.  The most reasonable one, without information to the contrary, is the one that exists on the user's system.  It should stay that way.

Unfortunately, it's probably the best idea.  "Fixing" things behind the user's back is generally a bad idea, because it leads to the kind of problems being discussed in these threads: mysterious behavior and failures, with calls to support groups for help with little to go on.

No.  There is a mistake in this logic.  My operating system would
produce drwxr-xr-x BUT I am running the script as sudo and sudo
inherits MY permissions which are drwx------.  So the result is the
SYSTEM files in /usr/local get MY permissions - which is not
appropriate.

The WHOLE reason to put files into /usr/local is to allow all users of
the computer to access them.  Changing the /usr/local to be owned by a
particular user (as advocated by some using home brew apparently) is a
bad idea because they are not accessible then.  Files in /usr/local
ought to be readable and executable by everyone.  This is the normal
systems file setup as in /etc for example.

I don't have access to install-tl right now but it's just a script,
right?  So the first thing it can do is set the umask.  The fact that
it's called by sudo isn't relevant.

drwxr-xr-x appears on directories in /usr/local in both Mac OS and
Linux.  It would be following the normal structure.

The ONLY reason this happened is that I personally like to keep my
files restricted AND sudo inherited my preference, applying my
preferences inappropriatedly to the texlive files in /usr/local.  But
my preference to restrict access to my files is NOT appropriate for
files in /usr/local, especially files that are publically available on
the internet!

I don't know from your messages what Apple recommends, but my bet is
that it is drwxr-xr-x for directories in /usr/local.

I am pretty clear at this point that it should make sure that the
permissions are drwxr-xr-x in /usr/local/texlive.

Why would a user install a publically available package in /usr/local
and NOT want anyone but root to be able to access it?  That doesn't
make any sense.

If you create the directory, set it to drwxr-xr-x.  If it is there
already, leave it alone.

Only change /usr/local/texlive to be drwxr-xr-x.

I haven't seen any good arguments to allow /usr/local/texlive to be
anything other than drwxr-xr-x.

Again, this happened because sudo inherited MY PERSONAL SETTINGS and
passed those to the texlive install script.  Those settings are NOT
appropriate for a package availabe to the entire system.

Howdy,

Was there a place mentioned in that article that Dick Koch pointed to where you can place a simple file that would produce what you wish; i.e., umask is 077 for your personal files/folders but the sysetm default isn't changed. It appears that using `umask 077` inside a shell changes the system default and, I suspect, the personal default picks its value from the system default.

Good Luck,

As I currently understand it, one cannot change the system default AT
ALL as a user.  Of course.  That would be a terrible security problem!

When I invoke a shell, I can set the umask for that shell.  I set it
to 077 for my personal files.

But testing your idea - I find that when I remove my setting, the
umask becomes 22.  That's the system wide setting.

When from inside that shell I run sudo on a script, that script
inherits MY umask and applies it to the SYSTEM files.  It's not
appropriate.  The solutions I know are to fix the permissions of the
system files if needed at the end of texlive installation or to have
the script (that is run by sudo) set its own umask.

No, the system value is never changed by the user but one can set
one's own value in a shell.

Note: a Terminal is the graphical display on Mac OS X.  A shell is a
program running inside the Terminal that provides the command line. 
One can invoke another shell from a first shell.  If I'm in bash, I
can start a ksh then an sh and then (with control-d) break all of
these --- all within a single Terminal:

% bash
bash-3.2$ ksh
$ sh
sh-3.2$ exit
$ 
bash-3.2$ exit
%

Weird indeed. But as far as I know Homebrew suggests to chown /usr/local
to a regular user, which is questionable for other reasons. BTW I run Homebrew, but not from
/usr/local.

You cannot change ownership unless you are root already.  And I don't
recommend to install everything as root.  I'm the owner of /usr/local
because I maintain the stuff therein.  It would be a pain if I had to
use sudo when installing to a directory owned by me.  And I would be

In respect of file permissions, I'm conviced that the current behavior
of both, TeX Live and MacTeX, is correct.  IMO it doesn't matter at all
whether it's a good or bad idea.  The only question is whether it's
correct or not.  It's *not* a matter of taste or convenience.

Thomas, you said that you're using tcsh.  I don't have OS/X but
doesn't it come with Bash as well?  Could you check whether it works
with Bash?

umask is a shell function and different shells have different startup
scripts.  It's quite likely that tcsh has other defaults than other
shells.  In order to find out which initialization files are involved,
consult the manual page.

  Reinhard

When you give your administrative password to do an installation
through a graphical user interface, you are (as I understand it)
essentially becomming root.  So just about everything you install IS
as root.  Furthermore, the requrement for using sudo in the texlive
2013 installation IS making the person root.

Furthermore, the purpose of being root is to prevent a normal user
from inadvertantly or maliciously changing the operating system.

> I'm the owner of /usr/local because I maintain the stuff therein.

You own your computer but root ought to own things in /usr/local to
allow all people working on the computer access.  If you want a
private package, install it in your own files under your home
directory and route your path through it.  Then you will have full
control over the installation AND when you move your personal files to
another computer, you will carry the program with you and won't have
to move /usr/local separately.

> It would be a pain if I had to use sudo when installing to a
> directory owned by me.

That strikes me as lazy.  It's hardly any extra work (0.5 seconds if
you touch type!!), installation occurs infrequently and using sudo
keeps the operating system secure.  If you want an insecure computer
system (and the resulting instability), use Windows.  (Last I asked, a
normal user can still modify a Windows operating system with no
safeguards.  As I understand it, that's most of why there are still
viruses in the world.  An exception is government installations that
prevent all changes on Windows so folks have to get a sysadmin in all
the time to do the most trivial installation.)

> And I would be pissed off if an installer disregards my personal
> umask.

Rightfully so, but this is only for texlive and the settings ought to
make the package available to everyone on the machine.  It only makes
sense, the texlive is public software.  Why would you want to hide it
from others on the computer?

You can always change it to be not permitted.  But take a look at your
/usr/local and show us what the permissions are in your packages
there.

You have not given any evidence that setting permissions to drwxr-xr-x
is wrong.  You have not given any evidence that the current behavior
is 'correct'.  All you did was assert that.

Of course I have bash on my machine, it's a Unix box.  But if I were
installing using bash, I would STILL set my own mask to 077 so that my
files are not visible to others unless I intentionally set them to be
visible.  This would probably still (inappropriately) propagate to the
sudo.  So the shell is irrelevant.

That's not relevant since users like me will set their shells to make
their files more secure.

I think that's right - the top level permission ought to prevent
access to the lower levels.

Don't know which GUI you have in mind, but if it asks for your
password, it simply passes it to sudo.  Most installers expect that
you run sudo yourself.  A root password is required only if you don't
have write permissions at the install directory.

It's not a requirement and I *never* installed TeX Live as root.  At
work I'm maintaining a TeX Live system on a server.  I'm not root on
this machine.  It's sufficient that I have write permissions.  All my
colleagues can mount it readonly on their machines. 

 > Furthermore, the purpose of being root is to prevent a normal user

root is the maintainer of your system.  You should log in as root only
when you are maintaining your system.  This is safest.  If you install
software which isn't part of your system, it's better not to install
as root, because then you can't break your system accidentally when
maintaining it.  Installing as root doesn't make anything safer.

I don't want a private package.  I don't want to be root when
maintaining TeX Live and some other packages.  It's more secure if you
can avoid being root.

/usr/local isn't used by the system.  It's for 3rd-party software.
It's owned by root by default because the administrator has to decide
whom to grant permissions anyway.

NO! The opposite is the case!  sudo runs programs with root
privileges.  *This* is unsecure!  Use sudo only when absolutely
necessary, i.e. when maintaining your system.

If you invoke a malicious program as a user, it can't access system
files at least.  If sudo is necessary in order to maintain the
program, keep in mind that sudo opens the doors to your system.

You can create unprivileged user accounts on Windows.  But since this
leads to many inconveniences, most people don't.  There are many other
things which make it easy on Windows to spread viruses even as a
mortal user.

The umask setting reflects user/admin preferences.  I regard every
program which tries to override them as being malicious.

It's not self-evident.  Since OS/X is based on BSD, I would expect
that csh or some derivate of it is available.  As far as Unix is
concerned, it's sufficient to provide a Bourne compatible shell.  But
there are zillions of them.  Bash is only one of them.

Urgh!  You deliberately misconfigured your system and now ask the TeX
Live team to fix it, i.e. to override your configuration?  I'm not the
one who decides but I can assure you that TeX Live *never* will
override user/admin settings.

If you insist on umask 077 for your personal files and want to
maintain a TeX Live System in /usr/local which can be accessd by all
users, do this:

 1. Create a new account "texadmin".  If there is someone you trust
    who can maintain the system when you are on leave, you might want
    to create a new group as well.

 2. log in as "texadmin" and set umask to 022.

 3. Create a directory /usr/local/texlive.

 4. Adapt ownersip of /usr/local/texlive.  If there is no group, run

      chown -R texadmin:users /usr/local/texlive
   
   otherwise, if the group is named "texadmin" as well,
 
      chown -R texadmin:texadmin /usr/local/texlive

 5. Log in as texadmin and install TeX Live.

You have to log in as "texadmin" in order to maintain your TeX Live
system (using tlmgr).  I don't know whether it's less convenient than
using sudo, but I can assure you that the procedure described above is
by far much more secure than anything which depends on sudo.

The purpose of sudo is to open the doors to your operating system, as
it's name implies.  Avoid it whenever possible.

  Reinhard

Hello,

I usally gpg sign all my important pdf documents, also include a image with my hand signature.

Curious to see how you guys do it, has anyone ever automated/related the hand signature with
gpg --clearsign on a latex document before ?

Any sugestions welcome.

Subject: [texhax] Thank you ....and a few queries
Message-ID: <51E4C835.8070907@lavabit.com>

Hello:

Thank you for the opportunity to present my queries to the group.

I'm presently transitioning from Windows to Debian GNU/Linux as well as 
learning Wget and improving my LaTeX (I used it about ten years ago for 
two years).

I would appreciate any feedback anyone can offer regarding the following:

1. I need to prepare legal papers for print and online publishing. 
Typical court papers with line numbering and court caption on initial 
page. I would like to prepare one source for both online publishing and 
print and presently I'm aware of only Texinfo ( 
http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/ , 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texinfo ) that I could use to accomplish 
that. I believe LaTeX would be better suited for the print layout I have 
in mind and I'm also more familiar with it. The print format may have 
things like a legend as the footer, marginal notes, varied font styles 
and sizes and I will probably be doing a lot of tweaking to margins, 
columns, page numbering, etc. I basically will be doing quite a bit of 
customizing. Is there any way I can prepare one source for both online 
and print format that uses LaTex to generate the print format? Is LaTeX 
anymore versatile/capable than TeX? Is there a document class for court 
papers?

2. I would like to reformat a few instructional manuals (LaTeX, Texinfo, 
Wget, Linux, etc) with smaller margins, smaller fonts and maybe two 
columns to print for personal use. Is there any way I can force LaTex to 
compile at fonts sizes smaller than 10pt? Any work-around? (I'm aware of 
the reasons for the standard margins; 66 characters, double-column 
newspapers, ease of read, etc. )

Thank you very much.

Michael

Try using the option 9pt or 8pt to the documentclass call. I think at least the 
most often used classes support that. komascript does.

Hope that helps,

Time was I had a little side business making custom signature fonts for use w/ mass mailings --- the issue of course w/ including a good quality image of one's signature in a digital file is the ease of copying --- I suppose the best thing to do would be to work up a METAFONT which would do this, then tweak its input slightly (using say the timestamp of the document, or an MD5 hash of the doc's source) so that one could verify when a given iteration of it should've been used --- a modern twist to registrar ink.

Fundamentally, LaTeX is TeX, just w/ a pretty interface --- it's certainly easier to use --- I wrote up a bit of a comparison here: http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Comparison_between_ConTeXt_and_other_typesetting_programs

Short version, use LaTeX unless there's a reason not to.

> Is there a document class for court papers?

There's jurabib (but it's for German). The formatting isn't too hard, the issue is the idiosyncratic references (assuming you're using bluebook). There was a bit of effort on this in the past, and some discussion here: 

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/122806/is-there-a-document-class-or-package-specifically-for-drafting-united-states-leg
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/71306/bluebook-support-in-latex

It looks like there're some new developments since last I looked.

Hi Michael,

    1. I need to prepare legal papers

http://www.ctan.org/topic/legal
Not sure any of these packages will be directly useful to you.
Most of them are for European jurisdictions.  I can't think of anything
else that was specificially for court papers.

This may be a total red herring, but it occurs to me that one of the
dramatic-play classes just might be useful as a starting point, if
you're talking about court transcripts.  Aside from the
fictional/nonfictional aspect :), I can imagine quite a few similarities
between the two.  http://www.ctan.org/topic/drama-script

    for print and online publishing. 

tex4ht (run "htlatex" from the command line) is another option for
making HTML from LaTeX, besides what Will suggested.

OTOH, if your online requirements can be satisfied with PDF, there's no
need for any other software; just run pdflatex instead of latex.

    I believe LaTeX would be better suited for the print layout
    [than Texinfo]

Speaking as the maintainer of Texinfo, I am sure you are correct about
that.  Texinfo was intentionally designed not to support typesetting of
arbitrary layouts, so you would find it very hard to change things
around.  Especially switching fonts.

    2. I would like to reformat a few instructional manuals (LaTeX, Texinfo, 
    Wget, Linux, etc) with smaller margins, smaller fonts and maybe two 
    columns to print for personal use. 

The Texinfo and Wget manuals, at least, use Texinfo.  You can add
@tex
@fonttextsize 10
@end tex
to the Texinfo source (or run texi2pdf -t "@fonttextsize 10", etc.) To
typeset them in a smaller size than the default, which is 11pt.

Smaller margins: check out the @pagesizes command in the Texinfo manual.

Two columns: no feasible way to do that one.

    Is there any way I can force LaTex to compile at fonts sizes smaller
    than 10pt? 

For the record, Texinfo uses plain TeX as a base, not LaTeX.

For more help with Texinfo specifically, as opposed to LaTeX, feel free
to write help-texinfo at gnu.org.

Hope this helps,
karl

Metafont creates bitmaps, it's certainly better to use MetaType1
instead.  The procedures are quite similar.  The advantage is that you
get a scalable vector font in Type 1 format which always looks better
than a bitmap font.

However, the expenditure of time can be enormous if one is not
familiar with these tools already.  What I would try first is to scan
the signature with the highest possible resolution, use a bitmap
manipulation program like GIMP in order to clean it up (remove noise),
and use potrace in order to turn it into vector graphics.

potrace can emit EPS and PDF directly.  If it's still necesseary to
manipulate the vector graphics, it's better to export it as SVG so
that it can be easily post-processed by Inkscape.  The latter can
export EPS and PDF as well.

Timestamps are not secure at all.  They can be changed at any time
(pdftk, qpdf).  SHA is more secure than MD5.  The only advantage of
MD5 is that MD5 hashes can be created by texlua/luatex, which makes
your TeX sources quite portable.

  Reinhard

I've created a lot of exams using only the article class, and a lot of customisation w.r.t. "\newcommand".

Will send some samples when I get home.

Subject: [texhax] Creating Exams with LaTeX?!

Hi,

I was wondering if there is any preferred method (class) to create written exams with LaTeX.
My exams consist basically only of two large exercises with subitems.
Sometimes I would need a graphic and there is need for equations.
There are about 100-150 subscribers for a single exam.

I checked on CTAN and there are some packages. I simply wonder which one is in common use, or which one is more or less obsolete.

Furthermore, I would like to introduce some automatism which makes it easier for me to rate the exams later. E.g. I was thinking to ask students to fill in the answers in allocated spaces.
Another idea would be some automation to create solution sheets, point and mark tables, etc.

I am aware that I might not be able to achieve the last ideas with pure LaTeX. Thus, I am happy to hear what other method you use for this task. E.g. I thought about using org-mode on emacs to create a metasystem which enables me to keep all (exam, evaluation, scoring, solution sheet, etc.) in one file but to generate exam sheets from it.

Thanks for comments, solutions and ideas

Torsten

Dear Tex

Trying your other address.

Can you help, please, with the construction of a very thin space.

The spacing of, say. 4.5 derived from:
\renewcommand{\thefigure}{\thechapter.\arabic{figure}} is too tight.

Whereas \renewcommand{\thefigure}{\thechapter\,.\,\arabic{figure}} is too
loose,

And the use of \hspace is not allowed.

You can make your own thin spaces putting something like this in your 
preamble:

\def\mythinspace{\kern 0.1em }
\def\myverythinspace{\kern 0.05em }

You can make negative thin spaces as well. The space between ...em and 
the closing bracket is *very* important.

P.S. \thinspace or \, is defined in TeX as {\kern 0.16em }.

Forgive my na?vety, but /why/ is the space important ?
The operator is a kern, not a skip, so neither plus
nor minus modifiers may follow; what (if the space
were omitted) could accidentally follow the brace
to foul things up ?

Oh! Apparently it isn't ---I just tried \def\myemspace{\kern 1em} 
(without the space, that is) and it works just as with a space between 
1em and }.

I think I took the habit of putting a space from Knuth's definition of 
\thinspace:

     \def\thinspace{\kern .16667em }

(The TeXbook, p. 352).

I do not have an example at hand, but without the space after `em', TeX
will still be reading and expanding tokens after the macro is called (to
look for the <space> that's supposed to be there).  Thus I expect
problems could occur with use in \halign templates and \span, and
differences could be found using \expandafter and similar
expansion-control commands.  Knuth did not put that final space in the
definition of \thinspace just for fun (\relax would work too).

It's definitely the best practice to make sure that macros terminate
their arguments.  Otherwise it's just asking for trouble.

Odd :  DEK does it consistently in Plain.TeX, where one
might have expected him to optimise --

He eliminates the optional space after \def and
the macro name (which I would insert to aid legibility),
yet adds a space before the closing brace that /seems/
to serve no purpose ...

Even odder is the inconsistent spacing after \kern.

To look for the <space> that's supposed to be /where/, Karl ?

Considering \thinspace as an example, and using DEK's
definition from Plain.TeX :

\def\thinspace{\kern .16667em }

No space is expected after \thinspace, which is automatically
terminated by any non-letter; no space is expected after \kern .16667em,
since all 2-letter units are self-terminating and
there are no optional plus/minus modifiers, so I cannot see
to what "<space> that's supposed to be there" you are referring.

Units can be followed by an optional space, so they?re not
?self-terminating?; if \thinspace did not include a space in its
definition, expansion would continue until a space is found, see:

    \def\aspace{ }
    a\kern0pt\aspace b

with no space between the two letters. Similarly, ?a\kern0ptb? and
?a\kern0pt b? are the same thing. So the space at the end of
\thinspace is quite important.

Paul

Yes, they take an /optional/ space, which is not quite
the same as a <space> being /expected/.

It may indeed be :  I think I am beginning to see why.  But you
last example seems to be more of a counter-example :  if
?a\kern0ptb? and > ?a\kern0pt b? are the same thing, then
the space is /not/ important, I would suggest.

However, returning both to Karl's original thesis and your
own variant thereof, it would seem that if one wants to avoid
a following token (or tokens, if the first expands to empty)
being expanded solely by virtue of TeX searching for "one
optional space", then including that space in the definition
(or by including \relax in its place) can indeed be required.

The space is important in the definition so a subsequent space, if any
is not gobbled. In other words, the space in the definition makes sure
the macro will have no effect on the tokens to come.

Exactly.

As for the space being ?expected?, I suppose Karl?s point was simply
that, since numbers or dimensions are so peculiar with respect to
space, it is good practise to always include a space token so
surprises are avoided.

In an old TUGboat paper, Donald Arseneau, Raymond Chen and Victor
Eijkhout introduced a ?TeX Hierearchy?, describing levels of knowledge
characterizing novices, programmers, wizards, etc., in TeX. They did
not include space tokens as shibboleths, but they could have done so:
- the novice?s document is riddled with unwanted spaces;
- the user puts ?%? everywhere, avoiding spurious spaces but sometimes
  running into trouble;
- the wizard knows when s/he should ask her/himself whether to leave a
  space or not, and how to answer that question;
- the guru always knows when to put a space character or not, even
  when spaces have funny catcodes.

Best,
Paul

That point I had completely failed to appreciate (until now).

I don't use a direct DVI viewer like xdvi because it might not
display postscript figures correctly:

% xdvi paper.dvi
xdvi-xaw: Warning: Raw Postscript commands on page 3 may be rendered incorrectly.

Instead I convert the DVI to postscript (dvips) and then to PDF
(ps2pdf) and view it with Skim.  This is fast enough not to be a
problem even with a 100 page document.

http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/

See:

http://schneider.ncifcrf.gov/ftp/l

for details (in a set of scripts).

The advantage of this is that I can edit the LaTeX source in one
Terminal (using vim for efficiency) and then write the file out with
the comma key (in my ~/.vimrc file I map ',' to be ':w[control-m]',
"'" to be ':q[control-m]' and ";" to be ':wq[control-m]').   Then (in
another Terminal) my atchange program
(http://schneider.ncifcrf.gov/atchange.html) recognizes that my .tex
file changed and runs the l script which pops up the Skim display.

The result is that in one window I edit the text.  I type a ',' to
save  it and a few moments later Skim (when set properly) refreshes
the PDF display.  I never take my fingers from the keyboard!

Another advantage of this method is great flexibility and one can use
whatever editor one wants.  One does not waste time moving the mouse
and resetting one's fingers back on the keyboard.

Skim in fact does this conversion automatically, i.e. you can simply open
DVI files with Skim directly.

Hi Hubert,
sorry I did somehow lost track of this thread.
Thanks I will look into it. In the meantime, I finished two exams using the

that.

Thanks again,
