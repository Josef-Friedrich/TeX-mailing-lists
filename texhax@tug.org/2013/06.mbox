Subject: [texhax] Adding "\section*" entries to TOC
Message-ID: <20130601143730.276c241a@scorpio>

I have a document that contains over 50 sections using the
"\section*{FOO}" style. I want these listed in the TOC; however, I am
unable to figure out how to do it automatically. The sections do not
have numbers in the main document, and I do not want them listed with
pseudo numbers in the TOC. Other than entering each one individually via
"\addcontentsline{}{}{}", which would be extremely slow, is there way to
accomplish this?

Thanks!

Put "\setcounter{secnumdepth}{0}" in the preamble.

Instead of \section*{} use \section{}.

If you insert

\setcounter{secnumdepth}{0}

at the beginning of the body of the document, and use \section{FOO}
without the star, then the TOC will display the (unnumbered) section
entries.

Subsections will not be numbered too, and you can control with the
tocdepth counter if they appear or not in the TOC

I assume that with "body of the document" you mean everything between
\begin{document} and \end{document}. 

You can do this alraedy in the preamble of the document.  The default
value is set in the document class file.

A basic idea of LaTeX is to separate content and layout.  Thus, no
layout instructions should be inserted after \begin{document}.  In
some cases it cannot be avoided but in these rare cases the macro
\AtBeginDocument can be used. 

The ability to keep content and layout separately is an invaluable
feature of LaTeX.

If you've set up tocdepth to a value which prevents sections to appear
in the TOC, the only way to get subsections into the TOC is to use
\addcontentsline.  "tocdepth" works from top to bottom. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Not knowing which class was used by the OP, I said that as a
preemptive measure in case some package, or the class, did things
using \AtBeginDocument (or \AtEndPreamble if etoolbox is used).

It is indeed probably cleaner to insert this instruction in the preamble.

Assuming of course (as is a kind of rule in LaTeX concepts of the
look of a document) that the user does not wish to change the
value midways through the document, then there would not be much ground
to put the first such instruction mandatorily in the preamble.

? well it is a feature, realized to /some/ extent. 

And observe how it (of course one may change it forcefully)
rigidifies the layout at the start. I don't
want to start a war about the pros and cons, but I will just
say that I have observed again and again that masters
systematically forget the amount of sacrificing any apprentice
has to do with respect to initial expectations:

   software is exemplary in that regard: learning to use a
software is learning not to repeat the naive things which
ended up in failure but could have worked. After a while, the
better learners do not attempt anymore anything which reveals
a failure of the software and then, they have learned it. 

   for the more alert, life is like learning step by step that
everything, starting with language, is ultimately a lie. The more
alert is seldom the happier guy.

agreed of course,
it was sort of tacit here that the OP would not set tocdepth
to a value preventing even sections to show.

The document class is "report" and no, I do not have any special or
fancy entries in the preamble. Actually, I do use the package
"fancy",but that is another story. I am also not even sure what the
macro "\AtBeginDocument" is referring too. I am a very new user of
LaTex, as you might have discovered, although I have used MS Word, all
versions, extensively for well over 10 years. I am currently using the
MiKTeX distribution on an MS Windows machine. Most of my writings deal
with legislative and/or government actions.

Hi, \AtBeginDocument allows to have some code executed at the
junction from the preamble to the body. This is very useful to
author of package B if there is a need to modify something
done by package A. Then it is not necessary to tell the user
to load B after A (and B can even test if A was loaded and take
appropriate action). Except of course in the case when A itself
does its evil things using \AtBeginDocument... then this will be
executed after the B \AtBeginDocument code, if A is loaded after B.

Sometimes as a user you say something in the preamble and it
does not do the expected thing: the explanation is often that
some package or the class itself used \AtBeginDocument to
insert some code which got executed after your set-up.

More authorized info is to be found in section 4.6 of 
file clsguide.pdf

In a command line console: texdoc clsguide.pdf

(I think this works also on MikTeX -- I am on TexLive)

Jean-Francois

I need to produce "Certificate of Distinction" for high-school students

Most important?I need to find a nice "mathematical" frame for it, something
which fits for math, but not for Spelling Bee, dance or sports etc

I could not find anything appropriate on texample. I definitely would

Years ago there was a nice article by Jeremy Gibbons in TUGboat about
creation of ornamental boxes from symbols:

http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb20-4/tb65gibb.pdf

Now there are many nice ornament fonts available, like adforn and
fourier-orns.  I think if you use them in Jeremy's macros, you can get
really nice frames with `mathematical' look and feel.

I thing we used the symbols from webomints to do a similar distinction.

I might even have some code for it somewhere if needed

Dear all texhaxers

I am wanting to write a document that displays all the fonts available on my system. To do this I've enlisted a batch script that returns all .tfm files in my texmf tree, which is then processed with R to create a LaTeX file with every font available. Unfortunately, a couple of errors get in the way of successful compilation. The first is that a number .tfm files produce the error: "Font xxxx not loadable: Bad metric (TFM) file". The second is that some files that pass this first test, throw a second error when compiled by themselves: "mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for xxxx"

What I would like is some sort of condition that tests to see if the font can be loaded and created. If it can, the test text is written in the font. If it can't, a message saying so is printed to the document. Any advice towards this end would be much appreciated. 

A minimal working example follows. The code should run properly as is. Uncomment the first line (fcsstt20) to get the first error, and the second (gbklisl25) to get the second.

Thank you very much!

    Dear all texhaxers

Unfortunately, a couple of errors get in the way of successful compilation. The first is that a number .tfm files produce the error: "Font xxxx not loadable: Bad metric (TFM) file". The second is that some files that pass this first test, throw a second error when compiled by themselves: "mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for xxxx"

i'll address only the "mktexpk" problem.

this makes me think that you're creating a
dvi file, for viewing with a previewer such
as xdvi.  if the fonts are type 1, then you
can instead use pdflatex; no bitmaps will
be needed.  if the fonts are opentype (many
modern system fonts), then you should
use xelatex.  in either case, you can view
the output with a pdf viewer.

many fonts created for tex now have type 1
outlines as well as metafont bitmaps, so
pdflatex works with those either way.  for
fonts that have only bitmaps, i believe
that pdflatex will produce output with
type 3 fonts, which will not scale well
(if at all), and will certainly look
dreadful if viewed at a resolution other
than the one for which the bitmap was
created.

i don't know a way to mix all types in a
single job, but someone else might.

But pdflatex will look for bitmaps and throw an error if the map
file which points to the type1 fonts has not been activated
correctly (which is probably the case here).

Hi Samuel,

A test to see if a font can be used ... I believe it was Frank Mittelbach
who once posted this code to check if a .tfm can be loaded:

     \batchmode
     \font\X=<font name>
     \errorstopmode
     \ifx\X\nullfont
       <font not available>
     \else
       <use the font>
     \fi

However, I don't know of any way to test if a font can be rendered,
independent of whether the .tfm is readable.  In theory, I expect it
should be possible in LuaTeX since the whole font loading process can be
tinkered with, but I don't have a recipe.

You will want to set the environment variables MKTEXPK and MKTEXTFM to
the (string) value 0, as in (for Bourne shells)
  MKTEXPK=0; export MKTEXPK
  MKTEXTFM=0; export MKTEXTFM

Also, I expect it would be necessary to use either xetex or luatex to
process the document for the sake of fonts only available in OpenType
format, as Barbara mentioned.

Also, I expect you would want to skip the (1500 or so) tfm's under
japanese-otf* if you have them installed, since they are "Japanese"
tfm's and need to be processed using ptex, which conflicts with
the need for xetex/luatex.

Also, I expect that any such document will run afoul of hardwired limits
somewhere, so you'd have to change texmf.cnf, remake .fmt's, etc.

In case it's of interest, for some of the known-bad tfm's, etc., see the
exclude_tfm list in
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/bin/check-files-by-format?view=co
We've tried to contact authors, sometimes fixed versions get released,
other times not.  So it goes.

Hope this helps.  Good luck :).

karl


P.S.  I've never tried to make a sampler like this, since there are over
25,000 .tfm files in TeX Live.  A document typesetting all of them seems
so large as to be unreadable, even if it can be processed.  Figuring out
any way to slice and dice such a large has always stopped me cold.

There are various attempts out there already -- my favorite is
http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue, FWIW.

You already have received some answers, here?s a different approach.
You could do the testing in the R part of the process, with something
like:

    check.font <- function (font) {
      if(system(paste("pdftex -halt-on-error \\\\font\\\\test=", font, "\\\\end", sep=""), ignore.stderr=T, ignore.stdout=T)) {
        whine(font)
      } else {
        include.font(font)
      }
    }

where, of course, ?whine()? and ?include.font()? are properly defined.
It will take a little bit of time, though, so it?s probably a good
idea to have ?include.font()? write good fonts to some external file
so you don?t repeat yourself (and you?re not forced to do all the
testing in one go), and perhaps then you create your TeX file with all
those fonts.

(I?m slightly surprised you?re using R for this job, but that?s what
you?ve said, so I?ve used it too; anyway this can be accommodated in
any language.)

Best,
Paul

Message-ID: <201306061802.13981.ghaverla@materialisations.com>

The invoice package apparently did work at one time, there is a 
note about using it with scrlttr of Koma Script.  What I was using 
for letters from Koma Script is scrlttr2.

Neither \begin{invoice} or \begin{invoiceenv} work (the second is 
the workaround for scrlttr).

Perhaps the log isn't verbose enough, but I haven't a clue as to 
why the invoice package isn't working with scrlttr2 of Koma.

I don't need to work with Koma, I don't need to use invoice.  If 
someone had a pointer to something better in the LaTeX world, I 
could try that as well.

Googling, I haven't run across why scrlttr2 is causing problems.  
If I have to, I can write Perl to make a Koma Script business 
letter with the invoice stuff manually calculated.  But, maybe 
someone here has played with the invoice package under Koma?

Thanks.
Gord

"It doesn't work" is not a sensible problem description. Make a
minimal example that demonstrates your problem.

I never attempted a minimal example, as in looking at the log 
there was no place to start.  Seeing that pdflatex ran out of 
stack was not a lot of help.

Fine, try to build a minimal example.  And it works.  Add stuff 
until it breaks.  The problem is coming from Canada and having a 
currency that uses the dollar symbol.

The standard escaping of the dollar symbol with a backslash 
doesn't work with invoice.  You still get pdflatex running out of 
stack space.  The documentation for invoice mentions \string$.  
That works, except it confuses the highlighting of code in emacs.  
What seems to work the best to me, is to also use the fontenc 
packages (with T1) and then use \textdollar{} where needed in the 
invoice.  This command does not work if fontenc is not used.

While the documentation for invoice says that you have to use

 \begin{invoiceenv}

instead of

 \begin{invoice}

when using scrlttr, this is not needed when using scrlttr2.

For a long "invoice" section, page breaks can occur in 
uncomfortable places (looks to me like a widow and orphan 
problem).  Using \clearpage after inputting data for a project is 
not the answer, as that starts the subtotals and totals on the 
next page.  Adding break lines (\\) does seem to work, but it is a 
manual process to determine how many are needed.

being a user of neither "invoice" nor "scrletter",
this is a shot in the dark.

\newpage doesn't have quite all the side effects
of \clearpage, so perhaps that might alleviate
the problem of where to break pages.  there's
also the plain tex fallback of \vfill\break (or
maybe a one-l \vfil would be enough if there are
no elements with stretch earlier on the page).

Hi,
 
I was happy to join TUG, mainly because I have an article in WORD (10 pages single-spaced) I wish to publish in the J. of Geodesy. I have not sent it in yet, but I think they want me to submit it in LaTeX. I have downloaded their Springer SV JOUR3 document class package (and users guide 3.2) which includes a lot of files, most of which my computer doesn't recognize.
 
I bought a 2007 book by Gratzer, "More Math into LaTeX," and it directed me to TUG. Gratzer says I need WinEdt and MiKTeX, but the book is already 6 years old.
 
Please send the CDs with all the programs and files. Will they be self explanatory? I am retired at homeand do not work in an organization where there is a TeX expert.
 
Thank you for reading,
Don Olson

Hi Don,

Thanks much for joining TUG.

First, MiKTeX is still current.  Assuming you have a reasonable Internet
connection, I recommend installing it over the net, instead of worrying
about a CD: http://miktex.org/download.  We will be sending you the DVD
shortly, but there's no advantage to waiting and installing from there.

As for WinEdt (http://winedt.com) ... it is just one of many graphical
"front-ends" to LaTeX.  Many people like it, but it costs a bit of
money.  If you'd just as soon skip paying, I suggest trying TeXworks,
http://tug.org/texworks.  (A couple of clicks from there will get you to
the download.  Again, it will be on the DVD you'll be getting, but
again, there's no real advantage to waiting.)

As for the TeX world being self-explanatory ... well, one would hope so,
but if you are used to Word, probably not.  TeX is a completely
different kind of program.  Tex is a typesetting language.  Instead of
visually formatting your text (as you do in Word), you enter your
manuscript text intertwined with TeX commands in a plain text file.  You
then run TeX to produce formatted output, such as a PDF file.  Thus, in
contrast to standard word processors, your document is a separate file
that does not pretend to be a representation of the final typeset
output.

http://tug.org/begin.html has plenty of links for further information.
I hope some of it will be helpful in getting your article done.

As for the specifics of how the J. Geodesy document class works, your
best source for help there will be the journal itself.  Hopefully they
provide some contact information for author questions.  No one else
in the TeX world at large (e.g., me) is likely to know anything about
it, unless by chance someone else reading this has published there.

BTW, this list (support at tug.org aka texhax at tug.org) is just a public
mailing list with hundreds of subscribers, so you may get additional
replies from anyone at any time ...

Thanks again.  Happy first-time TeXing :),
Karl

Hi,

please excuse my terrible ignorance, But I'm looking to start putting together a thesis, and am dreading using Word for obvious reasons - Friends use LaTex on a regular basis for this kind of work, and are very complimentary.

I will be doing something similar, but am hindered by only having a Mac at home, and windows computers at work - therefore if I work at home using MacTex, can I open or convert these files so that if I wish to continue work on the thesis at work using LaTex I can do so?

Again apologies for the basic nature of this request, I'm still getting up-to-speed!

Thanks!

Yes, this will work fine.

The one (minor) issue is the matter of line-endings --- you'll want to be aware of them and standardise your files on one style (Mac/PC/Unix). My suggestion would be to use an editing environment on Windows which can set itself to use the same line-endings as TeXshop does on the Mac --- I believe TeXworks:

http://www.tug.org/texworks/

does this --- it's also modeled on TeXshop so you should be fairly comfortable moving back-and-forth.

That was supposed to have ``assuming you switch to modern encoding like UTF-8'' at the end.

You have *only* a Mac at home?  Do you think it's worse than Windows?
There is no need to convert files unless you're using a text editor
provided by Microsoft.

William Adams already suggested TeXworks.  This is by far the best
choice if you want to have the same environment at home and at work.

Just to avoid confusion: There is no need to download anything from

   http://www.tug.org/texworks/

The web site explains what it is but it's preferred to simply install
the version which comes with MacTeX and TeX Live for Windows.

There are two TeX distributions for Windows, MiKTeX and TeX Live.
They both provide more or less the same functionality but
administration is different.  MacTeX is actually a TeX Live system, so
it's certainly better to install TeX Live on the Windows machine at
work.  It's very convenient to have the same environment at home and
at work.  But it's not required, MiKTeX works as well.  Don't know
whether you have a choice on the Windows machine...

Regards,
  Reinhard

If the OP is a new LaTeX user, it might be useful to have a look at the texmaker and texstudio editors. They are a bit more helpful (help suggesting macros when writing) to the user than TeXworks is.

And both a freely available for all platforms including Mac and Windows.

Hello, Dar?o!

I'm not sure whether I got your point. The page numbers are bound to appear
even if you use "\markboth". If your problem is that only "name" appears in
the headings, like discussed here

http://www.latex-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=11685

then the answer is this: "In one-sided printing [which is the default for the
article document class], all pages are considered to be right-hand ones" (page
90 of Lamport's book on LaTeX 2e). So you just need to choose two-sided
printing:

\documentclass[twoside]{article}

Section 4.4 of "The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX 2e" (freely available
online) also hints that the "fancyhdr" package might be useful for you.

Hope this helps! --Pablo.

Thanks for answer! I didn't think in the twoside, now I understand
what is the problem:
The article has only one page, therefore I will see never "Biography"
in the heading, in this case the problem was resolved.

Now if I want to have headings so on the left and right, in only one
page, how do I do?

Thanks again

You are not using \leftmark in the definition of your page style. 

You can use e.g. fancyhdr to setup a pagestyle which makes use of
\leftmark (=Bibliography) + \rightmark (=name) in the header.

Subject: [texhax] Problem configuring headers
Message-ID: <20130614123358.54a09f4e@scorpio>

I admit that I am not quite sure what I am doing. I spend a lot of time
creating legal documents using Word. Word has a nice legal template. I
am trying to use LaTEX but it isn't easy. It is too bad that LaTEX
doesn't have a native "legal" document class.

Anyway, what I am trying to do is get the Chapter name, actually the
"Article" name and the article number and title in the left side
heading. I can get the article's number but not its title.

Second, and I am not sure if this is possible, in the right side
header, I want the section name & number, plus the subsection name and
number ONLY if there is one. The way I have it configured now, I get
the section repeated twice if there is no subsection. The subsection
number should be printed on a line below the section number, which surprisingly is actually working..

I would really appreciate it if someone can tell me where I can find
out how to accomplish this. I need to have this approximately 50 page
report completed by this Tuesday.

Thanks Ulrike, but the commands did you tell me:

> You can use e.g. fancyhdr to setup a pagestyle which makes use of
> \leftmark (=Bibliography) + \rightmark (=name) in the header.

don't works good, I wrote in the code:

\begin{document}
\pagestyle{headings}
\rightmark{Biography}
\leftmark{name}

and when I compile, the pdf resultant put the Biography and name
together and not separated.

I resolve the problem using:
(before to \begin{document})

No, you must use the commands in the header definitition.

Use here \lhead{\leftmark, \rightmark}

and in the document \markboth{Biography}{name}

Subject: [texhax] Creating Exams with LaTeX?!
Message-ID: <CAPaq-gPsiZ+QzF0-PW4BzcarS4A4JPijz1AjGXvU9EzyOKB48A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was wondering if there is any preferred method (class) to create written
exams with LaTeX.
My exams consist basically only of two large exercises with subitems.
Sometimes I would need a graphic and there is need for equations.
There are about 100-150 subscribers for a single exam.

I checked on CTAN and there are some packages. I simply wonder which one is
in common use, or which one is more or less obsolete.

Furthermore, I would like to introduce some automatism which makes it
easier for me to rate the exams later. E.g. I was thinking to ask students
to fill in the answers in allocated spaces.
Another idea would be some automation to create solution sheets, point and
mark tables, etc.

I am aware that I might not be able to achieve the last ideas with pure
LaTeX. Thus, I am happy to hear what other method you use for this task.
E.g. I thought about using org-mode on emacs to create a metasystem which
enables me to keep all (exam, evaluation, scoring, solution sheet, etc.) in
one file but to generate exam sheets from it.

Thanks for comments, solutions and ideas

Torsten

Torsten,

I maintain a latex class for our exams. It is tailored to our needs of course but may prove a useful starting point for you to hack away at (which is what I did based on an original by a previous colleague). You can pick it up at www.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk/~sjs/FOR/ICPHEXAM/

The class allows you to do various things, like count up the partial allocation of exam marks, produce from a single file versions with just the questions, both questions and your model answers, or just the answers, etc. Including graphics and equations just relies on normal latex commands. It would be easy to leave space for the students to write answers with a simple construction like:

\fbox{
	\parbox[]{\linewidth}{\hfill\vspace{10\baselineskip}}
}

I'm not sure I understand what else you want/need, but creating solution sheets, or tick boxes, or whatever, is all straightforward in latex. As you'll see from my class, you can use class options to control what actually gets printed. So you could generate a condensed version that just had all the questions, and one with space left for answers by defining and changing a class option.

HTH

Best wishes
Steve

I have found the exam class useful. I think it does a lot of what you
require. You may see the documentation at

I have used exam class (there were two versions, now there is one) for 
around 10 years. Very robust and lot's of flexibility.

Subject: [texhax] tex live 2013 released
Message-ID: <201306192307.r5JN7UBc023350@freefriends.org>

As some people have already noticed, I made the TeX Live 2013 release
public yesterday.  I delayed this announcement to give it a start at
making its way around CTAN -- please do get the release from a CTAN
mirror.  More on getting TeX Live: http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html.

For links to the list of changes in this release (and a lot more),
see the TeX Live home page:
http://tug.org/texlive/

One post-release round of rebuilds is already underway for the sake of
(primarily) late-breaking mpost and pdftex bug fixes.  The new binaries
will be available in due course through tlmgr or directly from svn as
usual.  It is not at all imperative to get them (or I would have delayed
the release); the idea was just to make them easily available if you run
into the bugs.  More about this at http://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html.

I do not plan to update the *.iso (or *.tar equivalents) file(s) for
2013; the DVD is being manufactured now and will be sent to user group
members in due course.  (It can also be ordered from
http://tug.org/store.)

Updates from CTAN will start being available through tlmgr again after a
few more days.

Happy TeXing,
Karl

Subject: [texhax] Latin Modern with Computer Modern-compatible metrics
Message-ID: <4EFCCA47-4641-4C7A-A3D1-76F37EB1C807@aol.com>

Hello:

I have an old document that was carefully typeset using the Computer Modern fonts.  I need to replace CM with Latin Modern (eg, to get single PDF glyphs for accented characters, etc).  However, the metrics for LM, being different from CM's (most strikingly at the kerning of quotation marks), change the line breaks, produce overfulls, etc, which is not acceptable for my project:  I'm trying to reconstruct an almost-identical version of the original typesetting.  

So, is there an relatively easy way to get a T1 font with the LM glyphs but with the equivalent of CM metrics?  (I'd have thought this not to be a novel problem, but my search so far has not turned up much (aside from the scary prospect of having to build a virtual font from scratch).)

Thank you,

Alex

have you tried just using CM-Super? An outline version of the CM fonts, I don;t know whether the kernings are different.

CM-Super is the default font in a full TeX Live installation.

Thank you.  It was worth looking into it, but ? alas ? it is even worse.  Eg, the string ``x'' is about 2.5pt wider in CM than in CM-super.  Indeed, for the quotation mark ``, I see in cmr10.tfm (in PL translation)

  (CHARACTER O 42
     (CHARWD R 0.500002)

but in ecrm1000.tfm (CM-Super)

  (CHARACTER O 20
     (CHARWD R 0.333252)

LM ec-lmr10.tfm is a bit closer to CM, with 

  (CHARACTER O 20
     (CHARWD R 0.472)

So the concern shows up even without latin 1 characters.

If, as I think Lars said, cm-super is now the default, what
must one do in modern TeXLive environment to reproduce the
original computer modern appearance?

Is there a very short (at most two pages) document that
illustrates the issue well -- preferably one with non-ascii
characters outside of math zones?

Is the issue tangled with the micro level changes
introduced in pdftex back around 2001?

As for the larger context of appearance "reproducibility",
isn't lmodern (limited pretty much to Latin 1) just a
stepping stone?  Wouldn't a more useful extension of this be
to reproduce the appearance of original computer modern with
an open type font covering substantial segments of unicode?

Since one of your later posts indicates that you have the PL files for 
the original computer Modern, you could simply rename those to make them 
seem to belong to Latin Modern, run PLtoTF and ignore the checksum 
warning that will result when you try to use the faked up TFM.  You will 
also have to make up entries for the accented characters to fit where LM 
has them, but those need to have the same set-widths as the unaccented 
characters (watch out for the rare cases where that would produce a 
clash).  It is a dreary day's work, but no more.  I had to do something 
similar when I needed to loosen up the unpleasantly tight set-widths in 
later versions of Times to get back to a more traditional setting.

The problem is, that I am not sure you will like the results.  The 
aesthetics of LM sound as if they are substantially different from 
Modern No. 8, on which Computer Modern is based, and you may have to do 
some fudged kern pairings to get an acceptable result.
All these changes are possible in the human readable PL file. but you 
might tinker with a couple of the most extreme cases before you commit 
yourself to a day or so of tiresome text editing.

Alex, I'm afraid there is no royal road to retypesetting with different
fonts while simultaneously preserving every line break.  But maybe the
AE fonts will come closer than either LM or CM-Super.  As I understand
it (I've never actually used them), what you want to do is exactly their
intended purpose.

P.S. For the record 1, Latin Modern is very similar to Computer Modern
(as you might guess from the name; the Poles started from CM); calling
it a different design is unwarranted.  Though, as has been seen, it is
not identical in every detail -- e.g., they have made several changes
that Knuth has said he wished he had made in CM before he froze it.  We
had a discussion about the differences on the tex-live list a few years
ago, with the conclusion that although the incompatibilities could be
counted on one hand, that was enough to make it unfeasible to switch to
it by default.  By "switch" in this case, I mean using the CM metrics
with the LM glyphs (by changing the map file), not using the LM metrics
by default, that was clearly a nonstarter since any metrics change
however tiny is unacceptable.  Anyway, that approach won't help Alex as
far as I can see since it won't change the available glyph set.

P.P.S. For the record 2, it is not true that cm-super is the "default"
font.  Please try to avoid making or believing such rash statements :).
It is the default only in LaTeX *and* only if [T1]{fontenc} (or similar)
specified.  If one simply runs plain TeX or "plain LaTeX" without
loading anything to change fonts, you get (and always will get, as far
as I'm concerned) Knuth's Computer Modern.  For pdf(la)tex, you the
originally-bluesky-now-AMS Type1 fonts are used in the output PDF.
Neither LM nor CM-Super are involved.

The word "Latin" in "Latin Modern" is ***not*** related to ISO-Latin-1
(aka ISO-8859-1) encoding.

These fonts are called "Latin Modern" because they are supposed to
support ***all*** Latin scripts: Eastern European and African scripts,
Vietnamese...  ISO-8895 supports only 256 glyphs but each Latin Modern
font provides abt. 1200 glyphs.

  Reinhard

One option here would be to approach this at the DVI/PostScript level instead, replacing the calls to the bitmap fonts w/ calls to the equivalent Type 1 fonts.

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pkfix/

ISTR there are other such tools.

The specific case I was addressing:

So one would instead create a .dvi or .ps file, using the same toolchain and font / document settings, rather than a .pdf, and then one could use pkfix or a similar tool to replace the Type 3 bitmap fonts w/ the Type 1 fonts.

I did not suggest that because, as I understand it, pkfix will replace a
bitmap e with a Type 1 e, and will replace a bitmap acute with a Type 1
acute, but won't replace the two separate glyphs (e, acute) with the
single precomposed eacute glyph, which is what Alex said he wanted.

Just going by the documentation here, I've never actually run pkfix.

The ae fonts improve hyphenation of words with accents but they
still use the glyphs from the old cm fonts. So you won't get "single
PDF glyphs for accented characters" with them - they can't create
glyph that doesn't exist in the cm fonts.

But did you actually try if this affects many places? If I run a
test with blindtext the output is identical:

\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{scrartcl}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}
\usepackage{blindtext}
\begin{document}
\blindtext[2]

\fontencoding{T1}\selectfont
\blindtext[2]

\end{document}

If I add your example  ``x'' I get a different output, but this
looks as if the tfm needs to be adjusted only in a few places.
Perhaps you can even handle this cases by adding some kerning with
the help of microtype.

On Ubuntu it is better to add it to /etc/environment (remember to save a backup just in case), then log out and log in again.

Subject: [texhax] puzzling conversion to html
Message-ID: <20130627233844.GA99251@FR-W-C132678.ncifcrf.gov>

Folks:

https://www.tug.org/applications/tex4ht/mn.html

I'm trying to use htlatex (ie TeX4ht) to convert one of my papers to
html and have run into a very weird effect on Mac OS X 10.7.5.

I make a very simple LaTeX file and can convert it just fine UNLESS it
is named 'primer'.  In that case it fails.  The failure is that it
thinks the primer file is LaTeX 2.09 and it does:

          Entering LaTeX 2.09 COMPATIBILITY MODE
 *************************************************************
    !!WARNING!!    !!WARNING!!    !!WARNING!!    !!WARNING!!

I am getting this text from the primer.log file.  In the log file this
is eventually followed by a crash:

 l.22 --- TeX4ht warning --- \Link{tk-1}? ---
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [grouping levels=255].

The web page produced, primer.html, is blank (it contains characters but
shows up as an empty web page when opened in a SeaMonkey browser).

Using EXACTLY the same file but either named 'a.tex' or 'c.tex' ... it
works fine does not go into LaTeX 2.09 Compatibility mode and the web
page shows up the text as it should.

So for some reason the word 'primer' is special.  The weird part is that
the <title> of the blank primer.html page is:

   <head><title>Information Theory Primer</title>

I do have a paper with that title but it is NOT in the same directory.
Those characters are not in my environment (env) nor in my alias list.
Yet somehow htlatex is finding it and (also) putting it into the
primer.xref file:

\:CrossWord{)F1F-}{primer.html}{1}%
\:CrossWord{TITLE+}{Information Theory Primer}{1}%

How and how do I prevent htlatex from finding this in my environment?

Here's a simple script that demonstrates the effects:

********************************************************************************
#!/bin/tcsh -f
#(ie run the tshell on this but don't read the .cshrc or .tcshrc)

echo version = 1.00 of mkph 2013 Jun 27
# 2013 Jun 27, 1.00: origin 

cat > a.tex << EOF
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
tiny example
\end{document}
EOF

cp a.tex c.tex
cp a.tex primer.tex

foreach paper (a primer c)
   htlatex ${paper}.tex "html,2,info"
   open ${paper}.html
   grep WARNING ${paper}.log
   sleep 2
end
********************************************************************************

and here's one to clean up the files generated:

********************************************************************************
#!/bin/tcsh -f
#(ie run the tshell on this but don't read the .cshrc or .tcshrc)

echo version = 1.00 of cleanit 2013 Jun 27
# 2013 Jun 27, 1.00: origin 

foreach name (a c primer)

rm -f ${name}.4ct
rm -f ${name}.4tc
rm -f ${name}.aux
rm -f ${name}.css
rm -f ${name}.dvi
rm -f ${name}.html
rm -f ${name}.idv
rm -f ${name}.lg
rm -f ${name}.log
rm -f ${name}.tex
rm -f ${name}.tmp
rm -f ${name}.xref

end
********************************************************************************

Subject: [texhax] Mysterious hang-up using bibtex.
Message-ID: <51CCD70E.8070203@auckland.ac.nz>


I am encountering a mysterious phenomenon when I try to use bibtex.

I do "latex <filename>" and get the expected warnings about undefined
references.  I then do "bibtex filename", couple of lines of screen output,
and then the procedure just hangs; no prompt string until I do <ctrl>-c.

E.g.

     latex demo
     .
     .
     .
     bibtex demo
     This is BibTeX, Version 0.99d (TeX Live 2012)
     The top-level auxiliary file: demo.aux

Then nothing until <ctrl>-c is pressed.

But then (usually it seems) after a ***long*** while and repeated 
re-attempts,
everything suddenly works!  I then get:

     bibtex demo
     This is BibTeX, Version 0.99d (TeX Live 2012)
     The top-level auxiliary file: demo.aux
     The style file: plain.bst
     Database file #1: refs.bib

I run "latex demo" again (a couple of times) and all is well; the dvi 
file is
as it should be.  After that, I can process any latex file and bibtex runs
on it immediately.  Until after a re-boot (I think!).

What on earth could be going on?

One gets the impression that bibtex could be having trouble finding 
plain.bst
--- the hang-up seems to come just before this file name is echoed. But 
*why*?

The file plain.bst seems to be in the right place:

     /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/bibtex/bst/base/plain.bst

and if bibtex can find it "eventually" why can it not find it immediately?

Can anyone give me any suggestions as to how I might track down the
problem?

As the forgoing output indicates I am using texlive 2012.  I am running 
under
Fedora 17.  If any further information would be useful, just ask.

I have attached demo.tex and refs.bib (minimal example) so that anyone
who wants to can experiment with them.  As far as I can tell there is 
nothing
untoward about either of these input files.  In all probability no-one 
will have
any problems in running latex and bibtex on them.

Thanks for any insights.

     cheers,

         Rolf Turner

Runs fine for me on Mac OS X 10.7.

Consider turning off virus 'protection' programs.

Consider environmental variables.  In my previous posting I had a file
in my environment that messed up processing.

primer.tex runs fine here. Attached is primer.zip which has all files
relating to the TeX4ht run for favour checking at your end. Guess, the
error is specific to your system.

You have another primer.tex that comes up earlier in the TeX
search path.  Try "kpsewhich primer".

Oh, you already found the culprit.

I think you can display the entire search path by:

kpsewhich --show-path=tex

Maybe that will show why the other directory is searched first.
(Hint: a sensible search path must begin with ".:".)

Ahh, that's very useful.  The file I found was indeed in the path.  In
what file (or with what program) does one set the path?

I forgot. There is some shifting:

  \pdfliteral{%
    q
    % y-shift = 10 * (61/75 - 1) = -1.8667
    % x-shift = 10 * (2/76) = 0.2632
    10 0 0 10 .2632 -1.8667 cm
    BI

It *seems* to have helped!  I found that I indeed had a mixed up
setting of BSTINPUTS in my .cshrc file.  (For reasons that I won't try
to explain I use tcsh rather than bash.)  I had

     /home/rolf/Texstuff//:

in my BSTINPUTS before /usr/local/texlive//:

I *used* to have my texlive directory in own personal Texstuff directory.
Can't really remember why; probably because of a misunderstanding on
my part.

But anyway, even after I corrected my .cshrc and removed reference to
/home/rolf/Texstuff in BSTINPUTS the hang-up syndrome persisted.

Then I looked through the /tmp/out file that I created according to your
instructions.  I found several references to /home/rolf/.texlive.

I removed that hidden directory, rebooted and did the latex demo; bibtex 
demo
routine again.

The first time I did it the "latex demo" part took a very long time; several
minutes.  I was in fear and trembling, but waited patiently and eventually
it ran/completed.  Then the bibtex command ran immediately, no hang-up.

I rebooted again and tried again.  Again the latex command took forever
to run (the first time) but then ran promptly on succeeding tries. And again
bibtex did not hang.

So my problem appears to be solved.  But at the expense of introducing a new
(although relatively minor) problem in that the first time latex is 
invoked after a
reboot the command takes several minutes to complete.  I don't really 
understand
why my original problem was solved, or what is inducing the new problem.
What was that .texlive directory doing?  Where did it come from? Was
that *really* what was causing the problem.

These things are such a mystery to me!

But as I say, my original problem seems to have been solved, so thanks!

     cheers,

         Rolf

Hi again Rolf,

Glad the .bst problem is solved, anyway.

    the first time latex is invoked after a reboot the command takes
    several minutes to complete.

I suspect the same culprit: environment variable (mis)settings.  This
time I cannot guess which one.  TEXINPUTS?  TEXFORMATS?  TEXFONTS?
Could be any of those or quite a few others.

I speculate that it is rebuilding the .fmt file on that first run for
reasons undetermined.  But rebooting per se would not affect that (or
anything else about the TeX world I can think of); removing ~/.texlive
would.

    What was that .texlive directory doing?  Where did it come from? 

It's created as a normal part of installation and/or invocation, used to
store per-user recreatable data.  E.g., the luatex font cache,
dynamically generated tfm's, pk's, and fmt's.  Generally speaking, it is
neither necessary nor desirable to remove it, since then whatever is in
it just has to be recreated again.

Good luck,
karl
