Hi Krewe

I am writing an article for my SAS user group conference.
and am wondering about Convention Wisdom
for citations of wikipedia.org pages.

Are any other authors citing wikipedia.org as a reference?

If so,
1. which?

i.e.: as an article, book, collection, journal, proceedings, etc?

2. author for wikipedia entry?

These are the BibTeX entries I am using.

@inproceedings{www-wiki.Call-by-Reference,
    booktitle={www Wikipedia},
    year     = 2005,
    author   ={Et Alia},
    title    ={Evaluation Strategy},
    note     ={call by reference or call by value},
    url      ={http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_by_reference}}}

@inproceedings{utexas-trans.Why-Numbering-Starts-At-Zero,
    booktitle={Univ/Texas transcripts},
    year     = 1982,
    author   ={Edsger W. Dijkstra},
    title    ={Why numbering should start at zero},
    url
={http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html}}

These are valid concerns in the general case.  In my particular case,
however, I really am interested in the empty string, i.e., ''.

I'm sure there are better LaTeXie answers, but from a pragmatic point of view what matters is the information that gets inserted in your bibliography - and it's formatting. This has as much to do with your bibliography style (bst) as it does with the classification as article, book etc. So I would compose by hand what I wanted the citation/reference to look like and then get latex to match it. This solution of course is not robust against application to a different bst but it reinforces the point of the exercise, namely to generate a document that is appropriately referenced.

It is good practise, btw, when citing web pages, to include in the bibliography the date the page was accessed, as the reader may be in for a shock when they follow the URL and find something different. In the case of wikipedia, the user may even be able to troll through the document history to see when it was changed, why, and by whom.

I also think that the author field should be "Wikipedia" or somesuch, alphabetised undress W.

Best wishes

This is too much. Maybe when I read the page word by word and 
try many klicks, I will find an overview of what TeX Live's 
binaries tex, etex, pdftex, pdfetex do (what engine they use). 
Actually, the purpose of begin.html cannot be explaining TeX Live. 
I am not a beginner, you know, I have specific questions about 
TeX live. It seems to me that your hint real nonsense.

You seem to have a bias to misunderstand me and to send mails 
that miss the point and so are not helpful, so exchanging mails 
makes little sense.

Hello!

At the left side of a Wikipedia page there is a link "Cite this page", where
one can find the bibliographic information of the page and also the proper
citation in various formats; it also gives a BibTeX entry like this:

 @misc{ wiki:xxx,
   author = "Wikipedia",
   title = "ML (programming language) --- Wikipedia{,} The Free Encyclopedia",
   year = "2013",
   url =
"\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ML_(programming_language)&oldid=539737747}",
   note = "[Online; accessed 1-March-2013]"
 }

Hope this helps! --Pablo.

The most brilliant minds contribute to this list.

Anyway, Joel Salomon helped me to find words for a feeling of 
unhappiness with the TeX Live documentation: I read pages 
of a TOC in order to find a single entry that is not obviously 
irrelevant for me. Put roughly, I am happy with my TeX 
installation, so it would be nice to find something on "using"
TeX Live rather than "installing" something. Of course, I am 
not looking for TeX or LaTeX documentation, but for what is 
specific with TeX Live.

I have now seen the man pages for TeX Live commands, they are 
fine for me. What I perhaps "miss" is a list of TeX Live 
binaries with one-line descriptions -- that I can find without 
digging through a list of hundred links on other subjects.

The section "Extensions to TeX" is a kind of first steps towards 
such a list. There is an instance of confusion for me when the 
command "etex" is mentioned in the description item for 
PdfTeX, while the description item for e-TeX does not mention 
a TeX Live command for invoking e-TeX.

In this respect, I am saying that the documentation is 
not "complete", something is "missing". But even if the 
documentation does describe "using" TeX Live, it needs 
so much effort to find that that I have sometimes 
given up quickly.

I had found texlive-en.pdf when I googled for 
"list of TeX Live binaries", but I did not find a list of 
TeX Live binaries -- apart from file lists from Linux 
distributions, such lists don't help anything.

With "info" (Linux), I get a list including only a few 
list of binaries with one-line descriptions. On the web, 
there are lists of Unix commands with one-line descriptions, 
such as 

    http://ss64.com/bash/

This is alphabetical, the German Wikipedia has a smaller 
list ordered by subjects:

    http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-Kommandos

Variants of this just for TeX Live commands would be nice.

It is not urgent, I have "used" TeX Live successfully and happily 
without any documentation, by trial and error. I just started 
to think about "wishes" about TeX Live documentation after some 
contributors had behaved as if I had criticized the TeX Live 
documentation, and after the mentioned idea for "words" for 
such criticism.

 -- Uwe.

I don't necessarily claim to be blessed with wisdom, conventional or
otherwise, but I usually go for something like this:

Before, I wrote that I would like to see a list of all the 
TeX Live binaries that invoke some TeX engine, together with 
a short description. Especially I would like to see which 
engine is invoked, especially w.r.t. etex/e-TeX. 
(Actually TeX Live seems not to provide a real e-TeX, 
 rather "emulates" it by the DVI mode of PdfTeX.)

Now I see that Arno Trautmann's tex-overview.pdf 

    http://ctan.org/pkg/tex-overview

has a section "Program Names" that is what I would like to 
have. It only would need to be checked.

Thanks Reinhard for that information.

I have now upgraded to TeXlive2012 and tried to reinstall the files
but with the same depressing result. Everything now lives in
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local. If it wasn't for the fact that I have
used these fonts before I would think there is something not right
with the files.

However, I still think there's womething not right with the search
path. Though kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL gives me
/usr/local/texlive/2012/../texmf-local running updmap-sys --enable
Map=map does not list this file. mktexlsr does however. Any thoughts
would be greatly appreciated!

Howdy,

What is the path to the font.map file as reported by kpsewhich: i.e., what does

kpsewhich font.map

return?

What are you using for `map' in

updmap-sys --enable Map=map

command? Who owns your TeX distribution? If it's owned by root you need to use `sudo' before the command.

Finally, did you ever run updmap rather than updmaap-sys? If so you have a map file in your personal texmf-var (TEXMFVAR as opposed to TEXMFHOME) which is overriding the system one.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Before (on texhax), on "missing" TeX Live Documentation, I focussed 
on binaries. I did not mention another point, because it is not so 
clear with the distinction between "using" and "installing" TeX Live, 
and because I had to recall something. That was last year, 
integrating a second texmf tree for material outside CTAN. 
It was for a server, so it was essentially an administrator's issue.

I think I have found the solution today. The TeX Live manual may 
need no improvement here, but it was hard for me, perhaps just 
personally because in the beginning (last year), I did not start 
with the TeX Live documentation, but with the texhash help and 
the TDS specification. So I just spent much time with documentation 
that was not very relevant for my problem.

A general subject with perhaps-incompleteness of documentation 
may be that (especially with complex software) that manuals 
sometimes seem to be little helpful for "impatient" users.
An alternative may be "user-driven documentation" -- an FAQ; 
so structured that the most frequent or urgent questions are 
the most easy to find.

There actually is such an FAQ for TeX Live:

    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TeX_Live_FAQ

for example "I want to use ConTeXt". Until one has something 
better, one might point there.

That approach may also be helpful if, as Karl tells me off-list, 
TeX Life offers so much that is just too much for the maintainers 
to document it completely. As to binaries (that I focussed on 
before), this even seems to hold for engines and formats -- 
when I compare the TeX Live manual with Arno Trautmann's 
list of binaries.

The user's separate tree may be something very important, 
thinking of the user's favourite shorthands used for most 
documents.

Best,

    Uwe.

Hi Uwe,
first of all, let me clear one thing.  In a previous mail you assumed
that I deliberately misunderstand you.  I can assure you that this is
not true.  Maybe I often misunderstand you, but definitely not
deliberately.

On 2013-03-03 at 22:04:27 +0100, Uwe L?ck wrote:

Adding a new texmf tree is not difficult.  There is an empty texmf.cnf
file in the TeX Live root directory containing a comment:

 % This texmf.cnf file should contain only your personal changes from the
 % original texmf.cnf (for example, as chosen in the installer).
 %
 % That is, if you need to make changes to texmf.cnf, put your custom
 % settings in this file, which is .../texlive/YYYY/texmf.cnf, rather than
 % the distributed file (which is .../texlive/YYYY/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf).
 % And include *only* your changed values, not a copy of the whole thing!
  
If you read this, you probably still don't know how to proceed.  But
if you look into .../texlive/YYYY/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf, you'll find a
lot of documentation.  Since your additional tree is something like
TEXMFLOCAL, you can setup your additional tree similarly.

Don't hesitate to look into config files.  It's often amazing how well
they are documented.

But also see my comments below.  Maybe all your efforts had been
unnecessary because what you want to achieve is provided by TeX Live
already (depends on what *exactly* you want to achieve).

The texhash help message isn't a good starting point indeed. :(

Though the FAQ you mentioned is a good thing in general, it's
problematic to point users of TeX Live from tug.org to documentation
provided by Linux distributors.  This can be extremely confusing.
Linux distributors use a different directory structure.  Even worse is
that they don't provide tlmgr (it would clash with their own package
manager).  The preferred way to maintain TL from tug.org is to use
tlmgr.  Thus, the documentation provided by Linux distributors is not
always optimal and can sometimes be quite confusing.

I also fear that people hesitate to read documentation if it's too
detailed.  

Since people hopefully read the TeX Live Guide *before* they install
TeX Live, it's most important that the installation process is
described properly.

Once you have installed TeX Live and are interested in the details of
kpathsea, for example, you can always type

  texdoc kpathsea

on the command line in order to get the complete documentation.  If
the TeX Live Guide would contain the complete kpathsea documentation,
I fear that most people hesitate to read it at all.

As far as etex is concerned, you'll certainly find some hints in the
release history of the TeX Live Guide.

Some years ago there were distinct programs using etex, like pdfetex,
pdfelatex,...  Nowadays all programs except (Knuth's) TeX have etex
compiled in.  Thus, if you run "tex", you get Knuth's TeX with the
original hyphenation patterns for English only and without etex.  No
need to mention that it doesn't produce anything but DVI.

If you run any other program, etex and hyphenation patterns for many
languages are already supported.

 > The user's separate tree may be something very important, thinking

It's already there.  Try

  kpsewhich --var-value=TEXMFHOME

You can put your all your private files there.  The directory isn't
created by the installer because it's unaware of users.  There is also
TEXMFLOCAL where the administrator can put files supposed to be used
by all users, for instance site-specific document classes, the company
logo, and so on.

Furthermore, neither TEXMFHOME nor TEXMFLOCAL is touched by tlmgr or
the installer.  You can install your files there, upgrade to TL-2013
when it's availabe, and everything works as before.

These things are already there and described in the TeX Live Guide.
If that's all you need,  you certainly didn't have to create your own
texmf tree.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I believe you had an older version of TL from your distribution and then installed the latest TL, not connected to that distribution?  I did the same thing six months ago (because I couldn't figure out how to install a font so TeX would find it).  I ended with two versions of the binaries

ftpmaint at millstone:~$ find / -name updmap-sys -print
  -- bunch of 'permission denied' messages
/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux/updmap-sys
/usr/bin/updmap-sys
ftpmaint at millstone:~$ ls -l /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux/updmap-sys
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 44 Aug  7  2012 /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux/updmap-sys -> ../../texmf-dist/scripts/tetex/updmap-sys.sh

with the obvious resulting hilarity, which matches the behavior that you see.  The fi rst is the one that I wanted while the second is associated with the distribution.  To run the one that I want I use a full path, since I only run it once or twice a year but you might mess with PATH.

HTH,
Jim

At the left side of a Wikipedia page there is a link "Cite this page",
[left side of page: ToolBox]
where
one can find the bibliographic information of the page and also the proper
citation in various formats; it also gives a BibTeX entry like this:

 @misc{ wiki:xxx,
   author = "Wikipedia",
   title = "ML (programming language) --- Wikipedia{,} The Free
Encyclopedia",
   year = "2013",
   url =

}",
   note = "[Online; accessed 1-March-2013]"
 }

Hope this helps! --Pablo.

Yes, this is one of the key ideas I was looking for:
how to provide the url of the page that I saw.

thank you all,
your commentary helped me understand and reframe my Q
which were
* author
* correct class
* date-stamped Wikipedia page reference
* which style: APA was recommended by other SAS-user-group authors

As noted in my SAS-L post
http://www.listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1303A&L=sas-l&P=R5581

I decided not to go with the Wikipedia recommendation of class=misc
and stick with inproceedings.

Hi Kathy,

    Can you tell me what lines of this ilk mean in a log file (run with
    \tracingall)?
    % t=69.75652 plus 5.0 plus 1.0fil g=650.43 b=0 p=-10000 c=-10000#

Knuth explains it in detail in Chapter 15 of the TeXbook.
In short, it records that a potential breakpoint was added to the main
vertical list, whose height is the t value (with given stretch and
shrink).  The g is the goal for the page (\pagegoal), b the badness,
p the penalty, and c the cost of breaking at this point.

Happy page breaking!

All the best,
Karl

EuroBachoTeX 2013: Communication and typography
===============================================
This year's EuroBachoTeX theme is based on Bogus\l{}aw "Jacko" Jackowski's
personal doubts. Please have a look at http://gust.org.pl/bachotex/2013
to find out what eats him...

Apologies for this announcement being unusually close to the conference 
dates.
Being so, we urge you not to delay your decision on participating and/or 
giving
a presentation.  The registrations are open, beware of being late: the 
deadline
for normal rates is March 31st.

We count on your participation - if you visited one of the previous 
conferences,
you will remember that it worth coming. And it will be so this year!

Papers/presentations
====================
And now the conference content "as usual": we look forward to the
normal mix of TeX, MetaFont, MetaPost, ConTeXt, LaTeX, and friends related
presentations (please not not forget about fonts). There is also
the emerging BachoTeX trend of looking for a coming-together of
programmers and designers of typographic systems, typographers
and other users of such systems, so papers and activities in that
area are also most welcome. Please note the the call for
?TeX (MetaType/MetaPost) Pearls? further down.

The normal channel for offering papers is the emailing of
proposals to the Program Committee, but before rushing off to the
mailer, please consult the info for authors
(http://gust.org.pl/bachotex/2013/submissions).

Workshops and tutorials
=======================
Especially welcome are proposals for TeX-related tutorials or
introductions. If you have suggestions for tutorials or workshops
by others than yourself or about specific topics, please let us
know.

Poster sessions
===============
Participants will be given the opportunity to present their TeX
and typographic results in the form of posters for which we
provide exhibition space.

TeX (Metafont/MetaPost) Pearls
==============================
We continue the tradition of the ?Pearls of TeX (MetaFont/MetaPost)
Programming?.  Details and previously collected pearls can be found
at http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls/.

Deadlines and addresses
=======================
The deadline for abstracts and other proposals is March 28th
2013. The deadline for final papers to appear in the conference
materials is April 11th.

Contributions should be send by email to the Program Committee:
prog-ebt2013 at gust dot org dot pl. The PC is chaired by Bogus?aw
Jackowski (b underscore jackowski at gust dot org dot pl).

See you at Bachotek!

Do you mind posting a full minimal example? Including a list of package versions being used.

How do you preview the result?

Hi all

Since the last update, whenever I use $\left(x^2\right)^2$, the variable sized parentheses/braces/brackets disappear, leaving me with this output:

[cid:image003.png at 01CE1AB4.6C797E20]

Has anyone else seen this phenomenon? In my almost 10 years of using MiKTeX, there has not been an issue like this ever! This appears in the DVI as well as the PDF output (dvi -> ps -> pdf)

I?m on the latest packages available from the MiKTeX site.

Many Thanks

Thanks Lars. It was yhmath playing up. Removed it and no issues.

Wonders what was the problem though. I've had yhmath loaded for a long time and nothing wrong has occurred until today.

perhaps it had some assumptions about amsmath (or similar) packages, assumptions that no longer exist?

    I'm on the latest packages available from the MiKTeX site.

    [...]

in may 2010, the package formerly known as
"amslatex" was split in two -- "ams classes"
and "amsmath".  this split was sometime later
recognized and made at ctan; the distinction
was already built into tex live.  however,
miktex at some point noticed that amslatex
was no longer present under that name on ctan
and assumed that it had been withdrawn, was
obsolete, or ... and apparently rearranged the
distribution.  (not being a miktex user, i'm
not familiar with the details, but the problem
was reported in at least one tex forum:
  http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/96778/

since amsmath itself hasn't been updated since
version 2.13, dated 2000/07/18, i suspect the
problem is somewhere else, but i can't guess
exactly where.  however, i don't think the
problem as described should happen, so i would
really like to look at a test file (with the
yhmath package included) to see if the problem
can be tracked down.  some ams authors use the
package for larger forms of some diacritics,
but this problem has never been reported, and
if the source can be identified, that would
be useful.  you can send the test file(s) to
tech-support (at) ams.org.  thanks.

The Web2C documentation mentions an option -8bit rendering
8bit-characters printable.  I wonder on which TeX distributions 
I experienced that option -8bit was used.  I may remember correctly 
that they were not printable some years ago, while in the meantime 
somebody may have used -8bit for creating the memory dumps.

!?

Cheers,

    Uwe.

When I put an arrowhead on the end parametric curve it is pointing  up
rather than along curve. Is there a good way to put arrow in the correct
direction automatically?

How is the parametric curve created in the tex file?
Picture environment?  Graphicx inclusion?  MetaPost?

Subject: [texhax] Section numbering
Message-ID: <20130309181951.2bf01367@scorpio>

I am trying to format a legal document so that it follows this format.

      Article 1.

1.01 First section

      bla bla bla

1.02 Second section

      bla bla bla

etcetera.

I tried using this to get things working the way I wanted:

\usepackage{etoolbox}  %needed to make chapters continuous on page
%% Need with {etoolbox} package
\makeatletter
\patchcmd{\chapter}{\if at openright\cleardoublepage\else\clearpage\fi}{}{}{}
\makeatother

% change % chapter to article and center it
\renewcommand{\chaptername}{Article}
\renewcommand{\thechapter}{\Alph{chapter}}
\titleformat{\chapter}[hang]{\LARGE\bfseries\centering}{\chaptertitlename\
\thechapter}{0.125in}{\LARGE}

%Format section numbering
\def\thesection{\arabic{section}.}
\def\thesubsection{\arabic{section}.0\arabic{subsection}}
\def\thesubsubsection{\arabic{section}.\arabic{subsection}.\arabic{subsubsection}}

% Set section number depth to level 3
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}


Now, the problem is how to get a leading zero in the section and then
have it increment correctly. Once I reach the 10 level, the section is
shown as: "1.010", which is wrong. It should read "1.10". I can
accomplish this in MS Word; however, I can find no way to do it in
LaTeX. Does anyone have a solution?

Thanks!

Subject: [texhax] letterspaceadjust package
Message-ID: <513D08B5.2000900@gmx.de>

Hi all,

after giving a talk at the recent DANTE meeting in Hannover, I made a 
small package that might help improve typesetting in very narrow columns 
using LuaLaTeX.
The packages code inserts a small amount of stretchable space between 
all glyphs (not only words) and in combination with the microtype 
package results often in a more even, less spaced-out typesetting. As 
the whole this is quite experimental, I'd be very happy to have some 
alpha-testers who would check the code and see how stable everything is 
in everyday usage.
The package and documentation is available at:

https://github.com/alt/letterspaceadjust

I would be very thankful for any testing, comments and suggestions, and 
hope that a stable version of this package could increase the quality of 
narrow column typesetting a bit.

The original idea and a large part of the implementation of the code 
came from Paul Isambert:

unfortunately this mailing list (support at tug.org leads to a mailing list) does 
not accept attachments and thus has removed yours. So if you want help with your 
document, you will have to include it inline or upload it somewhere and post the 
link.

But better would be for you to localize your problem yourself, so you can ask 
much more precise questions if needed. Here's some advice how to create a 
so-called "minimal example", a document showing your problem but nothing more 
than your problem:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=minxampl

There's two reasons for doing so. First, chances are high you find a solution 
yourself while doing so. And second, help on this list is granted by volunteers, 
and the more precise a question is asked, the better the chance you'll find 
someone willing to spend the time answering it.

Yours,

	Susan

I apologize for not reallizing this. I remember having problems with attachments 
myself (many years back, and no guarantee it was really this list), and 
receiving a mail announcing an attachment but without any did fit perfectly to 
my preconceptions.

Hello Peter,

as you are new to LaTeX and this mailing list, I completed your minimal example. 
You made it easy for me, I have to admit, telling me all the packages needed:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{mathrsfs}
\begin{document}
\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{\vskip.2em
13. Let $K = \mathbb{Q)(\sqrt{m})$, let $p$ be a prime integer and let
$m \neq 1$ be a square free integer such that $m \equiv 1 \emph{mod} 4$).
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Prove: $p\mathbb{Z}$ rami?es in $K/\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if
$p \mid m$.
\item[b.] Perform computations analogous to those made in section 4.8 of
the text. (Note that $2\mathbb{Z}$ will be unrami?ed in $K/\mathbb{Q}$,
and care must be taken to distinguish between the split and inert cases
for $p = 2$.)
\end{enumerate}
\vskip.2em}}
{\it Solution.} \bigskip
%--------insert your solution to problem 2 below this line
\end{document}

And with this and some commenting out further lines (the whole enumerations is 
not needed for reproducing the error for example), I found your mistake fast:
right behing "13." you have \mathbb{Q) instead of \mathbb{Q}

Yours,

	Susan

another newbie issue ? OBSERVATION:  Susan answers something

sent by you.  PROOF:

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2013-March/

MAIN TEXHAX THEOREM.  To post to the list 
(so all readers can see it), send your mail to texhax at tug.org 
or support at tug.org (at least cc:).

COROLLORY.  When you get mail from a texhax reader/writer, 
encouraging you to post something, you should use the 
"reply to all" Button (function) of your mail program 
? not just "reply". 

If all posters follow this policy, all the discussions 
keep being visible for the community.

Best, Uwe.

Yes, and I explicitly made the discussion re-join texhax. As I did copy all the 
important stuff from his mail, I thought the one missed post would not create 
problems for further discussions. I apologize for not properly quoting his 
parts. My email client is quite unruly in this respect. I still need to teach it 
manners ...

So some editor highlighting brace matching would have helped. 
Moreover, such mistakes yield typical error messages such as 
"Runaway definition?", and it has often been advised to include 
such error messages in problem reports. A newbie user may have 
no idea what they are telling, but TeXnicians know. After a 
little training, everybody may understand the hints from those 
cryptical messages.

I've not seen the true original, only the minimal example.

With the identified error corrected, there are still a number
of things one might point out for someone new to LaTeX.

"1 \emph{mod} 4" does not look good to my eyes, and there's
a stray parenthesis to the right.  I think "\pmod{4}" (or
"\bmod 4") would be better.

In this clip the "fi" ligature is appearing for itself
(twice).  This may not be a good thing; replacing it with
simple "fi" will, I think, work more universally.

My reference materials are not handy, but I think for LaTeX,
\vspace should be used in preference to \vskip, and,
moreover, I think it's better to use ex units (rather than
em units) for vertical lengths.

And (1) it is often recommended to use \textit{Solution.} 
rather than {\it Solution.} (not so relevant here, rather 
with automatical kerning).

More seriously, the enclosing box is twice wider by the 
box rule widht and the separator width than the text width, 
you get an overfull \hbox warning. To avoid this, before 
\fbox should be \leavevmode\kern-\fboxrule\kern-\fboxsep, 
and after it there should be \kern-\fboxrule\kern-\fboxsep. 
But after that, the box is still too wide, and I must stop 
diagnosing now. For boxes around text of full text width, 
there are packages like framed and mdframded (and others 
I think), I cannot give more advice right now.

Good night,

    Uwe.

Now I have a proposal. "Solution" was beside the box, 
probably should below. And the box still was to wide 
due to the paragraph indent. The Unicode or so "fi" ligature 
just was not printed here, now done as Bill proposed. 
\vskips replaced according to Bill to.
There is a halfway correction of the "mod" that Bill criticized.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{mathrsfs}
\begin{document}
\noindent \kern-\fboxrule\kern-\fboxsep      %% UL
\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{\vspace{.5ex}
13. Let $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$, let $p$ be a prime integer and let
$m \neq 1$ be a square free integer such that 
$m \equiv 1 \mathop{\mathit{mod}} 4$).       %% UL
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] Prove: $p\mathbb{Z}$ ramifies in $K/\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if
$p \mid m$.
\item[b.] Perform computations analogous to those made in section 4.8 of
the text. (Note that $2\mathbb{Z}$ will be unramified in $K/\mathbb{Q}$,
and care must be taken to distinguish between the split and inert cases
for $p = 2$.)
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{.5ex}}}\kern-\fboxrule\kern-\fboxsep %% UL 
\\[1ex]                                      %% UL
\textit{Solution.} \bigskip                  %% UL
%--------insert your solution to problem 2 below this line
\end{document}

The amsthm has not been used. The "solution" might be typeset like 
a theorem. My mod is homemade close to what was there before 
rather than from amsmath. What for will \mathscr from mathrsfs
be used?

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Here is a version with a macro \problemboxsol in case 
the situation is repeated:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{mathrsfs}
\newcommand{\problemboxsol}[1]{%
    \noindent \kern-\fboxrule\kern-\fboxsep
        \fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{\vspace{.5ex}%
             #1%
             \vspace{.5ex}}}\kern-\fboxrule\kern-\fboxsep  
    \\[1ex]%
    \textit{Solution.}\bigskip}
%--------insert your solution to problem 2 below this line
\begin{document}
\problemboxsol{13. Let $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$, 
               let $p$ be a prime integer and 
               let $m \neq 1$ be a square free integer such that 
               $m \equiv 1 \mathop{\mathit{mod}} 4$).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[a.] Prove: $p\mathbb{Z}$ ramifies in $K/\mathbb{Q}$ 
                  if and only if $p \mid m$.
        \item[b.] Perform computations analogous to those made in 
                  section~4.8 of the text. 
        (Note that $2\mathbb{Z}$ will be unramified in $K/\mathbb{Q}$,
         and care must be taken to distinguish between the split 
         and inert cases for $p = 2$.)
    \end{enumerate}}
%--------insert your solution to problem 2 below this line
\end{document}

I have kept the strange ")" after "mod".

Cheers,

    Uwe.

I found Peter's "Thanks to all" below in my "unknown" box, five hours 
after my 

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2013-March/020175.html

("\problemboxsol").  According to its time, it is just a reply to 
Susan's diagnosis

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2013-March/020167.html

You also see the original code snippet that Peter sent to the same 
5 people (while not to texhax), and you can conclude how carefully 
Susan made a "minimal example" from it.  I am posting this to 
clarify and make public what happened.

As to the "boxing" component of the problem, I have collected some 
links to CTAN packages under

    http://www.webdesign-bu.de/uwe_lueck/heyctan.htm#ann-box

once I should add the new CTAN topics such as

    http://www.ctan.org/topic/?letter=B

As to the "problems and solutions" component of the "problem",

    http://www.webdesign-bu.de/uwe_lueck/heyctan.htm#exam

collects a few links. Nicola Talbot has just updated her "probsoln"
package.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Use \textless and \textgreater and you will get real angle brackets.
Kind regards,

Hello Philip,

As quoted from:

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Special_Characters#Less_than_.3C_and_greater_than_.3E

"The two symbols '<' and '>' are actually ASCII characters, but you may
have noticed that they will print '?' and '?' respectively. This is a
font encoding issue. If you want them to print their real symbol, you
will have to use another font encoding such as T1, loaded with the
inputenc package. See Fonts <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Fonts>
for more details on font encoding.

Alternatively, they can be printed with dedicated commands:

\textless
\textgreater"

I got exactly the same result as the OP, but this gave the angle
brackets to me immediately.

Using texlive 2012.20120611- on Debian SID.
Kind regards,

David Crosswell.

correct.  unknown in plain tex, named for latex,
and using fonts other than computer modern.

if using plain tex and cm fonts, they need to
be entered as math, $<$ and $>$ -- and they're
not really "angle brackets" except in the sense
of being used that way for coded input, e.g.
for html. "real" angle brackets (also math)
are \langle and \rangle.

In fact:

->\T1-cmd \textless \T1\textless .
l.3 \show\textless

?
 > \textgreater=macro:

Note that the 1 (that is the number one) is active.

This macro is available with no special packages loaded (as you might guess from the line numbers).

With no special packages, Michael, perhaps, but with no
special format(s) ?  The question was about TeX, not
LaTeX.

Phil, if 'plain' is not mentioned explicitely, I have to assume that
it's about TeX in general, including LaTeX. ;)

Unfortunately there are no < and > glyphs in Computer Modern text
fonts (explanation in TeXbook on page 427).

Maybe this helps:

  \def\textless{$<$}
  \def\textgreater{$>$}

It's probably necessary to add some kerning.  If not, its easier to
type $>$ instead of \textgreater.

Maurice, I don't know why you need < and > in ordinary text.  These
symbols make only sense in math formulas, as far as I can see.  And
for typesetting XML or HTML typewriter fonts are preferable.

David, if you are using palatino.sty you might have noticed that
the glyphs 'D' and 'T' are broken and look very ugly at certain
resolutions.  A simple solution is to use tgpagella.sty instead. 
TeX Gyre Pagella also provides _real_ small caps.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Well, that is a moot point.  Does TeX include LaTeX ?  I would
argue not.  If someone says "How do I achieve X in TeX", I think
it is reasonable to assume that he or she means TeX, and not
LaTeX; if, on the other hand, they were to ask "How do I achieve
X in LaTeX", then clearly LaTeX is the Universe of Discourse
and not TeX.

In books on linguistics (such as Quirk), <Am.E> and <Br.E> are
regularly recurring terms.

Both, plain TeX and LaTeX are macro packages.  I don't understand why
one should be more "TeX" than the other.  Because one is from Knuth
and the other isn't?  Knuth always encouraged people to extend TeX.
Ask Knuth what he thinks about LaTeX.  I'm sure that the answer is not
what you expect.

But let's continue this discussion at Bachotek.

Thanks for the hint.  I didn't consider this case.  But I would try
$\langle$/$\rangle$ here.  We don't have to stick with ASCII characters
only because non-TeX-users don't have another choice.  TeX is the
pacemaker.

  Reinhard

    Kind regards,

huh????

there's been a type 1 version available
for many years, certainly since the mid
1990s (don't have the time now to research
the exact date).  the "blue sky" versions
were included in ctan, and there was a
substantial update by tack hoekwater, with
input from hermann zapf, in 2009.

so to say that cm is bitmaps only is
nonsense.

Do they have other math content, such as Chomsky stuff? 
Could those involved in production simply not have known 
about typographically better symbols? Couldn't the 
publishers simply have said "We don't have other angle 
brackets here"? -- TeXbook p. 427, thanks Reinhard.

Practical recommendations:

I sometimes use \angled{...} instead of $\langle$...$\rangle$, 
after \def\angled#1{$\langle$#1$\rangle$} or 
\newcommand*\angled[1]{$\langle$#1$\rangle$}.

If the mathematical relation symbol is not needed at all, 
<...> may yield good typography after

    \catcode`\<\active \def<#1>{$\langle$#1$\rangle$}

If the math meaning is needed too or if you actually 
want to typeset SGML or XML code, ... let me know. 
doc.sty has something similar to \angled as \meta, 
ltxguide.cls offers <...> for \meta, both much more 
refined than what I have told above.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

While I was looking for something very different, I discovered 
that in linguistics angle brackets are used for referring to 
graphemes

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme#Notation

The English Wikipedia article only shows the "proper" angle 
brackets. The German Wikipedia tells much more about notation
variants for graphemes and sequences of graphemes:

     http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphem#Schreibweise_.28Notation.29

including "acute" brackets with really acute angles.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

I neither use nor recommend plain, but for plain I see
several approaches, particularly for the question of how
wide the brackets are.  I think the linguistic example mentioned
might be handled with use of \tt for each linguistic object.

This is plain:

\def\lt{{\tt <}}
\def\gt{{\tt >}}
\def\ltm{{$<$}}
\def\gtm{{$>$}}
\def\ltb{{$\langle$}}
\def\gtb{{$\rangle$}}
\vskip 25mm
\centerline{\bf ascii less-than}
\vskip 12mm

I can put {\tt <whatever>} in angle brackets inside a tt zone.

With \lt{}whatever\gt{} only the brackets are tt.

This is \ltm{}whatever\gtm{} using the math gambit.

And this \ltb{}whatever\gtb{} uses math with langle, rangle.

\end

Howdy,

How about using xetex with UTF-8 Unicode and an OTF System Font:

\font\tenrm="Times" at 11pt
\font\tenit="Times Italic" at 11pt
\font\tenbf="Times Bold" at 11pt
\font\sevenrm="Times" at 8pt
\font\fiverm="Times" at 6pt%\font\rm="Minion Pro" at 11pt
\rm
Here are < and >. {\it Here are < and >.\/} {\bf Here are < and >.}
\bye

since that uses Plain as the format.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

It's possible to write something like 

  \catcode`\<=13
  \def<{\ifmmode\char60\relax\else$\langle$\fi}

but you have to hide stuff using \ifdim or \ifnum in macros before.
Don't know whether the code is safe enough.

However, IMO your \angled approach is better, especially if a control
sequence name is chosen which describes what's between the braces
(logical markup).

Regards,
  Reinhard

I wondered what "linguistic example" referred to, Phil's <Am.E>, 
or graphemes ...  But finally it makes me think of usage of 
angled brackets in formal grammar, Backus-Naur notation

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form

as Knuth employs it to describe TeX's syntax on pages 268ff. 
of The TeXbook ...  However, \tt is bad then, Knuth uses \rm 
inside the brackets, and the brackets themselves are from 
the math font.

> This is plain:
> 
> \def\lt{{\tt <}}

What Knuth used for the syntax notation in The TeXbook
is plain too, manmac.tex:

    \def\<#1>{\leavevmode\hbox{$\langle$#1\/$\rangle$}} % syntactic
quantity

Using Bill's \ltb and \gtb, this is:

    \def\<#1>{\leavevmode\hbox{\ltb#1\/\gtb}}

E.g.,

    \<syntactic quantity>

(tested!)

Knuth's \<...> is a variant of \angled{...} and <...> 
I mentioned before.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Everything using < in \ifdim and \ifnum must happen earlier, 
i.e., macro definitions using them. My niceverb package offers 
commands to switch on/off such a syntax explicitly ...
when you are sure ... (e.g., somewhere \AtBeginDocument with LaTeX).

As to \ifmmode, I also thought of 

    \everymath\expandafter{\the\everymath\let<\lt}

After looking at manmac.tex (my earlier posting), I prefer 

    \def\angled#1{\leavevmode\hbox{$\langle$#1\/$rangle$}}

while I still have not understood \/ entirely 
("provisional" for the case of \it?)

Cheers,

    Uwe.

It's mentioned in the index of The TeXbook.  AFAIK there is an
italics-correction entry for each glyph in the tfm files.

If you want to investigate, the program tftopl is your friend:

  tftopl --help

Not being able to recall the post that mentioned application of this,
the only time I use \/ is to assist in separation of a font that
interferes with itself on display, generally in regard to fi, ff, or fl
combinations.
Is that the application here?
Kind regards,

David.

Message-ID: <CAF=Ssq62OBxtUbEOE2mE00zd8BoY121unBaf4_eZO7XKixaCmw@mail.gmail.com>

When I use the frame=single option in the lstlisting environment from
the listings package, the frame produced extends outside the text area
of the page, on both the left and right sides. One hack solution is to
put the whole thing inside a minipage environment. However, is there a
"better" solution? Here is a minimal example (see also attachments):

\documentclass[oneside]{book}
%
\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{showframe}
\usepackage{listings}
\begin{document}%

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
  x=1
  x=2
  x=3
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{minipage}{50mm}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
  x=1
  x=2
  x=3
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\end{document}%

Many thanks in advance,

Subject: [texhax] lstlisting frame from listings package too large

When I use the frame=single option in the lstlisting environment from
the listings package, the frame produced extends outside the text area
of the page, on both the left and right sides. One hack solution is to
put the whole thing inside a minipage environment. However, is there a
"better" solution? Here is a minimal example (see also attachments):

\documentclass[oneside]{book}
%
\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{showframe}
\usepackage{listings}
\begin{document}%

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
  x=1
  x=2
  x=3
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{minipage}{50mm}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
  x=1
  x=2
  x=3
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\end{document}%

Many thanks in advance,
Dan

In this case, AFAIK f{}i, f{}f, f{}l are an alternative, 
another issue that I have not understood completely 
(what is better, and why it works -- The TeXbook once 
 confused me here).

> Is that the application here?

No, ...

According to The TeXbook (p. 14), the italic correction \/ is
appropriate when changing from a slanted (e.g., italic) to an 
unslanted font, except before period or comma.

With LaTeX, you may not know about \/, \textit and \textsl insert 
it automatically. There may be cases when the automatic behaviour 
is wrong, then you can prevent it by \nocorr (if you know about 
this feature).

What I wonder about is that I sometimes find other applications 
of \/ in macros by very knowledgeable authors. I remember 
applications after boldface. The recent example was

    \def\<#1>{\leavevmode\hbox{$\langle$#1\/$\rangle$}} 
        % syntactic quantity

from Knuths manmac.tex for typesetting The TeXbook on top of 
plain.tex. It is used to typeset TeX's Backus-Naur syntax rules. 
The argument is typically typeset in \rm, I cannot remember 
having seen anything else. I wondered what rationale differing 
from what The TeXbook tells is behind such a use of \/ after 
roman (or after upright boldface).

In the special recent example, I now guess: The italic correction 
makes up for "ink" looking out of the character box to the right 
(TeXbook p. 64). The ink of a closing bracket touches its left 
box border even at its top, and it is from a different font than 
what is at the left of it. Without the italic correction, there 
is a real danger that the closing bracket touches the final 
character.

You can search the texhax archives

    http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/

for "italic correction", you get 75 hits and a large thread 
"cases for italic correction". Unfortunately, I have not 
found a posting listed there dealing with its subject 
(it was mainly about the "d" in math italic).

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Font problem.
Message-ID: <514A4A5F.4010008@auckland.ac.nz>


A while back I sent an inquiry to this list in respect of how to produce
a solid "heartsuit" symbol.  A couple of list participants supplied me with
very nice answers.

The simplest answer, it seemed to me, was:
> \font\heartfont=favmr7y at 10pt % set your own size here
> \newbox\heartbox \setbox\heartbox=\hbox{\heartfont\char"56}
> \def\varheart{\leavevmode\copy\heartbox}

That worked fine --- on the laptop that I was then using, which was
running Ubuntu Linux.

I have since acquired a new laptop, and as a result have had to
(for reasons too complicated to explain) switch to Fedora Linux
(version 17).

Just now I tried using the forgoing "varheart" construction and
got an error basically saying that kpathsea could not find font favmr7y.
The complete error output was lengthy, so I am not supplying it here.
If it is relevant I can easily supply it.

I tried doing "sudo yum update texlive" (followed by "sudo texhash")
to see if that would help --- it didn't.

Can anyone advise me what I need to do to make this font available?

I have no idea what extra information I need to provide to assist the 
experts
in diagnosing my problem.  Please tell me what you need to know and I will
do my best to supply the information.

Note that I am a fairly enlightened user of LaTeX and of Linux in some 
respects,
but am a total ignoramus in others --- so please be patient with me!

Thanks.

Hello,

I am doing research and development of an open source engine management system for common
rail diesel engines. And a forum thread or a blog ain't just gona do it.

I want all the power of tex (speacilly the maths), yet I would like to keep a diary style
documentation(the time available is low) and a strutured type documentation, where people
could search and cases where i state X but i later find out that X is wrong, it would be
awesome to cross this information.

The plan would be to keep this on a git repository with all the pics, graphs and snippets of
code.

As anyone ever did this style of report ?
What approach did you take?

I would love insight.

Is there anything wrong with the standard report format for this?
\tableofcontents and \hyperef, along with other specs in your preamble
should do it from what I can see from your stated requirement.
Kind regards,

Hi:

I am a copyeditor being asked to edit TeX and LaTeX files for a publisher.

I thought I could just work on the TeX files in Word, treating them as ASCII files, but the publisher wants me to edit the actual TeX files and send them back to them as edited TeX files, not as ASCII files.

Could you please tell me what program I should obtain and install to do this kind of work?

I don't really need to be be able to run TeX/LaTeX as a typesetting program. I just need to be able to edit the native files.

Thanks very much for your guidance!

TeX files are plain text: you can edit them in any text editor. Word is
a not-so-good choice as it's standard method of working is to save in
binary format. Something as simple as Notepad will work, although there
are many specialist TeX or programmers editors which may make life easier.

In principle you could use Word and saving as ascii, but the file may not be in ascii in the first place.

You might want to have a look at 

TeXMaker, http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/
TeXStudio, http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/

(they are very similar)

There are lots of others.

They are free and easy to install. You don't need latex to use them as editors. Also they are quite good at detecting input encodings in case the files are actually not ascii.

TeX is in ASCII already.  The files could be '.txt' but are normally
labeled '.tex'.

As others have said, any text editor will work as long as you save it
back as text.  We can have religious wars about which editor or
environment is best.  If you have Unix you (Linux or Mac, maybe
cygwin) will have a vast array of free tools available.

If you use an environment built for TeX or LaTeX you can get automatic
typesetting but at the price of being forced to use their editor.

I use vim (visual editor improved) which is usually available on unix
systems.  (See: http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/vim.html .)  The reason I
use this editor is that it is extremely efficient for making changes
quickly.  I'm editing this email using vim and I'm not touching my
mouse at all, which means I keep my fingers on my keyboard and zip
through the typing and changes.

When working with LaTeX I automate my work using atchange
(http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/atchange.html) so I don't like
environments that force poorly designed editors (ie anything other
than vim!) on me which make me use the mouse.  Once atchange is set up
to watch the text file and run the appropriate programs, I can just
type a comma ',' to get the typeset pdf while keeping my fingers on
the keyboard all the time.

Unless you are careful to avoid commands (they will look like
\command{stuff}) this may not be a good idea since you could mess up
the file and make it hard for the author to correct it.  It would be
best to set up an environment which runs and typesets the file so that
you can see your results.

Let the religious wars begin!! 8^)

I had thought of mentioning Emacs ...  Computer programmers tend to
like Emacs.  I tried it briefly one day and found it forced me to use
multiple key presses simultaneously for what would be one key in vim. 
I think the tradeoff is that in Emacs you can program very fancy
things (like recognizing a language's structure).  Since I don't need
(or am ignorant of?) that, the complicated keystrokes get in my way
for fast typing.  Also, vim is Vi Improved and it does allow some
rather powerful things now (compared to the old vi), though I don't
know if it comes up to the level Emacs allows.

    TeX is in ASCII already.  The files could be '.txt' but are normally
    labeled '.tex'.

watch out here -- unless the basic language
of the files is english, it could be using
another encoding.  utf-8 is becomeing more
and more popular, for good reason.  (i have
no idea what word will do with utf-8.)

Barbara, Thomas:

Thank you so much for your input, and helping along a newbie.

Here is a sample file (.txt) I edited (along with original ".tex" file).

Without being specific, the publisher told me I could not give them a "txt" file because "characters will not appear correctly in ASCII format."

So, all "wars" aside, what I guess I need to know is that if Word could inadvertently introduce artifacts that would prevent or interfere with TeX compiling the file correctly, all I need to use is a bare bones editor that will enable me to give a ".tex" file back to the publisher.

I am not creating dvi files. I am not 'typesetting' the book.

I am only doing "language editing," not actually editing the equations

Thank you.

Steve

Given the O.P.'s description of his issue, I'm inclined to
think that neither emacs nor vim is a good response.  For
U.S. area code 718 he probably wants a simple UTF-8 capable
text editor.

Shall we assume that we are talking about GNU Emacs, which
AFAIK is the original?

It was written in the era of terminals having small
keyboards without arrow keys, numpad keys, and function keys
but just a ctrl key and a meta key aside from classical U.S.
"qwerty" typewriter keys (and maybe also an escape key).

The user can re-configure keys with great flexibility, and,
in particular, the user can make assignments to all the
"new" keys.  It's quite likely that no two keyboards in
one's office are the same, and even a given keyboard can act
differently when emacs is run in a command line than when it
is run directly under a GUI.

Emacs contains (and is built on) a powerful lisp engine that
can be used stand-alone or can be accessed from the editor.
It is capable of doing more or less arbitary processing
tasks.

First, I'll second what others have indicated: Word is not a good choice for editing .tex files, simply because it's too easy to be saving in Word format rather than plain text format, hence getting all sorts of other junk embedded that a TeX system won't be able to handle.

Second, while any plain-text editor will work, there's a definite advantage to using such an editor that's TeX-aware: it will do some kind of syntax coloring, catch unpaired brackets, etc.

Third, if you're "just editing" the .tex source files, how do you know your edits are purely innocent and will still give error-free TeX processing?  Hence it's probably a good idea to install a TeX/LaTeX distribution along with a TeX-aware text editor? That way with a simple click on a button you can verify that the modifications you made still allow the document to be processed by TeX. 

Even more, by processing the file(s) in TeX, you'll see an output format (typically, pdf these days) will be a lot easier for you to proofread than would be the .tex source with all its mark-up.

On Mac, you can get an entire TeX distribution that includes an excellent TeX editor in the form of MacTeX (the underlying distribution is TeXLive).  On Windows, proTeXt is a similar combination except that it uses MiKTeX as underlying TeX distribution.

Hi Murray:

Thanks very much.

I was wondering about that.

Would a newbie like myself just be better off installing MacTex, as you suggest, or would I be better off steering clear if it requires a TeX expertise I don't have?

All I'm doing is editing the language in the .tex files. I am not editing equations. (Though I have a PDF version of each chapter I am editing which I am looking at too just in case things like an unmatched fence were missed.)

I'm just looking for the simplest, easiest route to editing the basic language part of the files, without possibly introducing encoding problems that could throw TeX off later, and being able to give a ".tex" file back to the publisher.

Thanks again. 

Steve

Without getting too complicated about whether that claim is correct, 
just do what the publisher asks for. It is the publisher who is paying you.

The short answer is maybe. You don't know what set up the publisher is 
using to compile the book and it would not do well for you to change 
characters and make life difficult for it.

I don't know aht computer you are using but I assume it is Windows of 
some age. TeXWorks seems to be fairly popular at the moment and has the 
advantage of providing you with auto-completion (makes your work easier) 
and a bunch of other labour saving devices.

Installing TeXWorks does not mean you are installing TeX: you are not. 
It is just a front end for editing TeX files (and some other stuff you 
are not going to be using).

Most importantly for a contractor such as yourself. It is free.

i think it's possible to do the editing,
provided that the author hasn't used a
lot of tex commands *in the text*.  you
might ask to take a look at the file(s)
before you agree to do the editing.  if
they are generally free of any commands
that begin with the backslash \ you are
probably safe.  if you have to deal with
author-defined commands, and you don't
know much about tex conventions, you're
possibly in for a hard time.

the closer the source is to "plain text"
(that's quite different from "plain tex"!),
the safer you'll be.

good luck.

I have experience of helping a geologist friend of mine write a book in 
LaTeX when all he'd ever done before was use Microsoft Weird, so I have 
a bit of experience in this area!

I had him download and use "Crimson Editor" (now called Emerald Editor) 
which is easy to install, has syntax colouring and bracket matching, as 
well as a "library" facility, and is pretty easy to use -- at least he 
thought so.

It's available here http://www.crimsoneditor.com/english/download.html

I definitely support the idea that Word is a bad choice for an editor. 
Although people know how to use it, most of what they know how to use is 
positively unwanted when coding (La)Tex.

Although I do not use Microsoft Word as a TeX editor
(I use TeXworks and WinEDT), I do not think there is
any a priori reason not to : all that is necessary is
to remind oneself that its (Word's) sole function in
such a role to insert, delete, copy, cut and paste
unformatted text : nothing more.

Robin Fairbairns gave me the solution to  my problem, off-list.

For completeness the solution was to do

     yum search arev

and then on the basis of the results of this search do

     sudo yum install texlive-arev.noarch texlive-arev-doc.noarch

Now all is in harmony!

Thanks.

Well, since Steve is on OS X (he asked whether he should install
MacTeX), it doesn't make much sense to discuss the pros and cons of
Microsoft Word in detail.

As far as UTF-8 is concerned, we still don't know how the files Steve
has to edit are encoded.  He certainly doesn't want to re-encode them.
However, almost all editors support UTF-8 nowadys.  I never used Word,
but I recently created a .csv file containing UTF-8 characters.
Though Excel allows to specify the encoding when "importing" .csv
files, a requirement was that the encoding is detected when people
click on the filename in the Exploder.  In this case CP1252 is
assumed.  I found out that UTF-8 is detected if the first byte of the
file is a BOM.  If Word behaves similar then it might be halfways easy
to create UTF-8 files but it can be painful to load UTF-8 files which
don't have the BOM already.
 
The best choice is indeed to install MacTeX and use either TeXShop or
TeXworks as an editor.  They are both part of MacTeX.

They are both easy to use and the ability to compile the document in
order to check whether it still works is quite helpful.  It's also
helpful to see the formatted output without all the control sequences.
And an extremely nice feature is that one can click on a particular
word in the PDF preview and the cursor jumps to the same word in the
TeX source file (or vice versa).

Steve,
the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that installing
MacTeX is by far the best solution.  As a Mac user you certainly want
to use TeXShop as an editor.  It's easy to use but quite powerful
though.  It's designed for the Mac, so you will be comfortable with
its user interface immediately.  As said before, it's part of MacTeX,
you don't have to install it separetly.

I'm absolutely sure that TeXShop is exactly what you asked for and that
you'll enjoy it.

BTW, it's strange to see that if someone doesn't mention the OS he's
using, everybody assumes that it's Windows.  And even after you
mentioned MacTeX, people suggested to install Windows binaries.  Sigh!
When will Windows users grok that they are not alone in the universe?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Why not? Word on the Mac is pretty good. I would use it to edit txt 
(tex) documents though because it may change characters depending on 
what font (therefore character set) is set as default.

I think ASCII, from the first post.

Agreed, it is what I use and I have used a lot of different editors.

Not really. It was the talk about Word that led me astray and I am a Mac 
user who uses Word on the Mac every day.

That is more likely to be delays in postings getting through various

Quite so; it fiddles with quotation marks, dashes, fractions, all sorts 
of things.  To say nothing of creating lists where you didn't want them 
and so on.

All those things can be switched off, of course.

No, not alone, but they do occupy 90% of it therefore assuming a
Win/32/64 environment is going to be right the majority of the time. I
personally know many users who use different flavors of LaTeX on
Windows machines simply because they work better there then on their
native *nix cousins. I use FreeBSD as my primary PC environment;
however, I have never gotten any distro of LaTeX to work worth a crap
on it. I would rather pull my own teeth, sans Novocaine, then attempt to
get it working correctly. When time is money, I, like many others,
simply go when the money is.

Just my 2?.

It's the operating system that decides what to do with the file.  You
can name a file anything (on Unix systems like the Mac or Linux) but
the .txt or .tex helps programs know what they can work with.  (Also
the first two characters of a file are, I believe, a 'magic cookie'
that helps programs.)

Vim, emacs or other straight text editors will do it.  Word or other
word processors take a long time to start and are awkward to
manipulate in comparison.  On a mac, just open a Terminal.app and type

  vim myfile

and away you go!

As others have said, it would be much better if you have an active
typesetting system going.  Then you can edit not only the text but
everything and you will know if you messed up the typesetting.

Out of curiousity I looked at your two files.  They apparently have
non-standard commands in them that your publisher must have defined:
\Chapter \autoref \citep.  I went into both files and removed the '\'
on them to get them out of the way.  I then added:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}

to the start of each file and

\end{document}

the the end of each file.  This was sufficient to make LaTeX happy with each.
So I just typed:

latex 1.tex
latex rev.tex

and latex happely generated the usual files:

 1.aux  1.dvi  1.log
 rev.aux  rev.dvi  rev.log

Then I did something you will really like.

latexdiff 1.tex rev.tex > paper.tex
latex paper       # run latex to make dvi file
dvips paper       # run dvips to make postscript paper.ps file
ps2pdf paper.ps   # convert postscript to pdf

Then I looked at the paper.pdf and VOILA - there were the changes you
made nicely marked out!

I'm on a Mac and so use the Skim PDF reader so I look at it with that.
(It can be set to automatically update.  So while I'm editing the
source latex .tex file in vim, I type a single ',' and my scripts
automatically typeset and Skim redisplays without me taking my hands
off the keyboard.)

I put the entire directory in an attachment.  Check out the paper.pdf
file first.  The 'mk' file is a script that does the job.

Subject: [texhax] Problem reinstalling pad (agaramon) font. (''mktexpk:
 don't know how to create bitmap font for padr8r'')
Message-ID: <514C2DC2.1030004@gmail.com>

Dear TeXpert,

I tried to reinstall the Adobe Garamond font (I had to do a reinstall of 
my OS, which is kubuntu 12.04 LTS).
To do this, I used the pad.zip (from http://home.vr-web.de/was/fonts) 
and installed everything as mentioned (renamed the type1 fonts according 
to the Karl Berry scheme), and did a 'texhash' and 'updmap-sys --enable 
Map=pad.map).

When I try to dvips the document, it fails with following error message:

(and so on)

When I watch pad.map, it looks like this: padr8r 
AGaramond-Regular        "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc <padr8a.pfb


What could the problem be?

An internet search did not provide me of helpful information, alas!
So, any help of you is highly appreciated!

I see that actually a mistake happened, rev-1.tex.txt has question
marks where in 1.tex are quotation marks.

It is correct that you should not send ASCII files. 
But ASCII is not the same as plain text.

ASCII means that only (at most) the first 128 "characters" 
are preserved.  The more recent ISO-8859 encodings preserve 
(almost) 256 characters.  They suffice for "Latin" alphabets, 
especially they can handle many accents, currency symbols, ... 
that cannot be encoded by ASCII. 

The standard today is to encode much more than 256 characters, 
by Unicode.  With the standard UTF-8 encoding, in general one 
character cannot be represented by a single byte. 
This is a difficulty for certain TeX versions, 
some care is needed to deal with 2-byte characters.

But still it is plain text, and .tex files are plain text files.

You should not make .tex.txt files.  This is may be a difficulty 
with Word: saving "as plain text" what Word internally handles 
as something binary, and then that funny program adds the 
.txt extension.

You should simply edit the .tex files, without changing their 
names, at least keep the extension .tex.

There are probably ways to avoid such mistakes with Word, 
and mistakes can happen with plain text editors as well. 
I would just say that Word is too heavy for the task.

A plain text editor usually does not change the encoding, 
but I have experienced difficulties with that.

Especially, I just had an experience where I received ISO-8859 
files, while my editor by default saves as UTF-8.  This actually 
broke the TeX runs.  The text editor I used for this task is in 
my view not very helpful about encodings, but I found a way.
I needed a trick to corroborate my suspicion that the original 
encoding was 1-byte and that I should keep 1-byte encoding. 
The fogging editor allowed saving "as ISO 8859-15" as an 
alternative to UTF-8.  That was OK, although the encoding 
probably was ISO 8859-1 and the editor displayed some symbols 
wrongly.  I just needed to save "in 1-byte mode".

That was just a story, it was on Linux.  If you are on Windows, 
I cannot tell you much, have not worked with it for some years.
You might just try Notepad and first clarify its behaviour 
with encodings on examples, we might help here about that.

> I am not creating dvi files. I am not 'typesetting' the book.

Then I would consider it bad to get an entire TeX installation. 
But it would be good if you had an editor with TeX syntax highlighting.

The terrible gedit that I used here on Ubuntu-Linux at least is 
great in that it provides TeX syntax highlighting without requiring
a TeX installation.  Maybe you can find something similar, 
maybe you could switch to Linux, it is not so difficult today!
You could simply, as I have done, buy a little laptop and install 
Linux on it, as an alternative to the computer you mainly use. 
This may be easier than learning how to choose the operating 
system while booting or create hard disk partitions for different 
operating systems.

Best,

    Uwe.

I have an ms that is to be published in the online journal I do the tex 
editing for.  For reasons I don't want to go into, I cannot ask him to 
revise it; it was put into tex by a grad student, not by the author.  The 
grad student ended every paragraph with \\ followed by a blank line.  You 
can see the effect from this simple file:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
This is a test of what \\

does to add to parskip\\

and again

And here it is without the\\

\end{document}

There are 1063 instances of \\ in the file and probably several dozen are 
actually appropriate, maybe a 100.  (This ms compiles to 170 pages.)  I am 
not about to go through it and take out the ones that shouldn't be there. 
One thing I tried was \parskip -5pt.  This helped but are a few instances 
where the student "forgot" to add the \\.  So is there any way to nullify 
the effect of \\ when it is followed by a blank line (or, presumably, a 
\par) but still has the correct effect otherwise?

Most text editors have global search and replace. I would recommend replacing \\<two newlines> with <two newlines>. This is probably the only option.

I use XeLaTeX under Windows and have been using Crimson editor(s) for
years. But I would like to change. I have been able to use Crimson to
typeset English and Chinese, but it does not seem to support full
UTF-8 encoding.

But I have some additional requirements not mentioned (?) in the
previous emails:
  1. I very often use column editing. I want to be able to switch in
and out of column mode using only the keyboard (no mouse).
  2. I usually have maybe 10 or more files open at a time. I want them
all accessible in a single tabbed window. I want to be able to switch
to different tabs using only the keyboard.

Of course, I also need UTF8 support. And I want TeX syntax
highlighting and very much want bracket matching.

Maybe Ultraedit supports all this, but last I knew, it is not free. Is
there any free programs for Windows to meet these requirements?
Vim/emacs?

As Bob recommended, a good text editor could easily do the job; if
your editor doesn't do regex search/replace, you might consider
switching to another one :), or try the following (probably not
extremely robust) snippet:

    \bgroup
    \def\dospace#1{%
      \global\let\spacechar=
      }
    \dospace{} %
    \egroup

    \def\checkpar{%
      \futurelet\next\docheckpar
      }

    \def\docheckpar{%
      \ifx\next\spacechar
        \expandafter\recheckpar
      \else
        \unless\ifx\next\par
          \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\doublebackslash
        \fi
      \fi
      }

    \def\recheckpar{%
      \afterassignment\checkpar\let\next=
      }

    \let\doublebackslash=\\
    \let\\=\checkpar

Best,
Paul

You definitely want to give Vim a try, it can do all of the above (and, of
course, so much more). Some people say Emacs can do that too :)

That would certainly be a breeze in emacs, using ^q^j^q^j for the two 
newlines.

I tried that and got mysterious error messages.  I don't know why.

To all those who suggested changing \\<NL><NL> to \\<NL> it doesn't and 
really cannot work.  I got some mysterious error messages (mostly owing to 
\\ followed by a blank line inside xy-pic constructions, although one I 
couldn't track down).  But I fixed that and compiled the document.  The 
trouble is that now the entire article (or, to be precise, each chapter) 
is now a single paragraph and set that way.  Thus there are no \parskip 
and no \parindent and, while you could omit either one, you cannot omit 
both and have a readable document.

Thanks for trying.

Don't replace \\<NL><NL> with \\<NL>, replace it with <NL><NL> LaTeX
basically ignores whitespace, so 5 consecutive new lines is equivalent to 2
(but different than a single new line).

The \\ is the problem; that's what you need to get rid of. As Pierre
mentioned, the substitution is straightforward in emacs, but as far as I
know can't be done in, e.g. MS notepad. What text editor are you using?

And yes, it's likely you will have to spot check to verify you didn't
replace anything you didn't mean to. (This is what grad students do best :-)

Don't know where your "90%" comes from.

At our local TeX meeting in Hannover there are abt. 10 attendees.
Only one of them is using Windows, one is using OS X, everybody else
is using Linux.

Sorry, I'm not religious.  I only believe in what I can see.  And I
see that only 10% of the TeX users are using Windows.

Yes, but neither of them are beginners tools.
Let a beginner try a simple text editor, before he tries for a
graduation to one of those, otherwise you run the risk of alienating
them and reducing uptake.

In his original message, Dan mentionned such things as block editing and
mouseless operations, so I don't think he really qualifies as a beginner.

Anyway, there exists a simpler version of Vim for Windows, called Cream:
  http://cream.sourceforge.net/
I've never tested it, though, so I can only mention it. The good thing is that
it is a configuration of Vim, not a fork, so you can always switch to the
``real'' Vim.

Best,
Paul

You might want to give PSPad a try. <http://pspad.com/en/> It is really
quite a robust program once you get use to it. It is my favorite plain
text editor for Windows. I stopped using Crimson years ago.

You are using the statistics for a single program. I was referring to
the fact that 90% of all PC users, use Windows as their primary
environment.

I'm not religious either, and I suppose Windows does tend to force one
to be adaptable.
Somewhat like living in the intertidal zone of the shores of Orion and
every bit as inhospitable.
In fact, up until now, I hadn't really considered it in the light of
being an operating system.
Interesting perception!
Somewhat like that of the outsider art school of thought.

Never mind!
We'll use your share of Linux and the BSDs, for you.
Kind regards,

David.

Lies, damned lies and statistics (Disraeli)
Lies, damned lies, statistics, and opinion polls (me)

Basically Stat 101 is a religious indoctrination: to understand its meaning
one needs a Probability Theory, and for this a Measure Theory, and if a
student learned Measure Theory and Probability, he/she is probably learned
already Real Analysis and is smart enough not to take any Statistics, leave
alone 101 :D

Just about statistics: for guessing ("estimating" mathematically) 
a poster's OS on the present list, the statistics for that single 
program are relevant.

I have tried using TeX on windows and then had to shift to linux. I
understand many will not have the freedom to choose their operating system
at work. I found that many windows editors would insert hidden characters
in tex files. Collaborating with persons on Windows became a problem.

I normally keep away from sputterings of rank nonsense (a.k.a. trolling).

Truly egregious ignorance is on display here.

Just because something can be abused/misused does not invalidate correct use.

Apparently someone also skipped Logic 101.

Good day!

I am quite fond of Notepad++ as a Windows text editor. Personally, I'm a MacTeX guy who uses Vim or nano when I go native.

However, Notepad++ is very versatile and can be run as a portable app from a flash drive.

There are a few sites that have LaTeX configuration info for Notepad++. Here are two:

Syracuse U Physics Department, what's not to like ... http://physics.syr.edu/~salgado/software/latex/miktex_setup/

Nimal's Weblog ... http://nimal.info/blog/2010/latex-on-windows-with-miktex-and-notepad/

I'm sure there are other Notepad++ resources available for the looking.

BTW, I really like Notepad++ because I am still addicted to editing files with sftp access.

I cannot imagine anything that Word could possibly do that is
more awkward than interpretting a comma as a command to typeset
a file.  Do you have to prefix every ordinary comma with some
meta-command to prevent typesetting taking place ?

Word may not be the world's finest TeX editor, but at least
it does not usurp the meaning of one of the most common
characters used in texts.

Vim has a command mode where single characters are "commands". 
You insert a real comma after going into "editing" mode.

You should not think that the many Vim fans are idiots 
who just never have tried Word. Rather, many have tried 
Word, but really find that working with Vim is much easier; 
although not easy to learn.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Uwe's right.  One enters the insert mode with a variety of commands
(such as iIoOaA - they come in logical pairs!) and leaves it with an
escape character.  One pops rapidly between the two.  There is never
any confusion about a normal ',' in the text.

In my vim control file (~/.vimrc) I added these lines:

map , :w^M
map ; :wq^M
map ' :q^M

So:
a comma     writes the file out without leaving vim.
a semicolon writes the file out and       quits vim.
a     colon                               quits vim.

They are logical (!luck!) and convenient for common actions.  Vim is
fast and efficient, these make it more so.  I type these while in
command mode of course.  (Note: these might be overriding some of
vim's normal commands - I never checked ...)

[NOTE: the symbols '^M' mean an actual control M so you would have to
replace each with a control M to get these to work.  That's easy in
vim.]

Actually, vim isn't really that hard to learn.  One can get the basics
in a day - see my page http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/vim.html -
especially the one page 'cheat sheet'.  If one starts a new word
processor one has to figure out where things are kept in the pulldown
menus.  If you haven't tried OpenOffice or LibreOffice you can try
them and you will see what I mean (and they are open source and free
so you don't have to pay anything!).  For every word processor command
one is FORCED to use the mouse to nit pickingly find the right
command.  You have to learn the locations of the commands.  In Vim one
simply types the command - no mousing at all since the command's
controls are effectively in one's head instead of a pull-down menu. 
Learn the command, it's always at your finger tips.  The point is that
there is a learning curve for any editing program.  The difference is
that Vim is efficient because it cuts out hunting with a mouse.

People who do very complex things like emacs and that's fine, but if
you want to edit with speed and precision and don't need a full blown
Turing machine, vim will serve you better.

Also, vim is open source and so should always be available. 
Commercial programs usually die eventually.

I have some vi macros somewhere lying around that turn vi into a
Turing machine, so don't sell vi short.

(Having said that, I used emacs for all my "serious" editing.)

Let me start by saying that I am not interested in a flame war over my OS 
or editor.  My editor is one I have been using since 1984 and I will not 
change it.  My OS is windows and I will not change that either.  I did try 
Linux for a few years, but gave up since I could not find an editor that 
suited me.  Emacs is unquestionably powerful, but I could not use it.  I 
could not figure out even the magic incantation that enabled word wrap. 
(I had a .emacsrc file from an earlier version that did enable word wrap, 
but failed with this version.)  I am accustomed to this editor I have been 
using for over 28 years and will not, at my age, change.

On failing of this editor, despite its unquestioned power, is the 
inability to search across line breaks.  It does regular expression 
searches and has other powerful features, but not that.  It includes a 
scripting language that would work, but I have forgotten how to use it and 
it just wasn't worth it to change.  So here is how I solved my problem. 
First I changed all instances of .\\ to .  Ditto for $\\ since only 
paragraph ends could appear after formulas.  There were still quite a few 
\\, mostly correct.  So I asked the editor to display all lines and only 
those lines that contained a string "\\ [lots of blanks]". 
along with one line below (and, unfortunately, one above) each of them.  I 
then eyeballed all of the them and deleted by hand the \\ that were 
followed by a blank line.  It took me much less time than it would have to 
relearn the scripting language and infinitely less that to learn a whole 
nother editor.

Honestly, Michael, why didn't you tell us of your preconditions when you presented
the problem? If you had told us you were stuck in a 1984 time warp we could have
worked from there. I might add that sed was available at that time and could solve
your problem, but I suppose you don't have that on your Windows machine.

Really, if you write to this newsgroup in 2013, your should expect to receive
solutions that are at least of this century.

Cheers,
Michael

It's probably not installed but it's available for Windows:

I think that we have to respect his age at least (though I don't how
old Michel actually is).  I understand that people don't want to
change the text editor they are accustomed to.  Though I recommend
TeXworks to beginners, I don't use it myself because I'm accustomed to
the Emacs keystrokes.  I've bought a book about vi because I tought
that it can't hurt to be halfways familiar with the ubiquitous Unix
text editor, but since I knew how to achieve things with Emacs, I did
not look into the book frequently.

Text editors are nasty things.  Once you are accustomed to the
keystrokes of a particular one, you really don't want to use 
another one.

As far as the age concerned, a friend of mine stuck with emTeX on
MS-DOS while all his colleagues switched to Windows and the rest of
the world to Linux.  He said that *in his age* it's not advisable to
change a running system.  I met him 20 years later and was surprized
that he's on Linux now.  Seems that the age is only an excuse, not
a hurdle.

Regards,
  Reinhard

No reason to! I think most people would do the same as long as their 
once-made-and-now-familiar choice still meets their needs. This has nothing to 
do with age. My 6-year-old god-child also insists on doing things how she always 
did them and not change just because I have a different approach ;-)

My favorite editor has the same shortcoming, maybe it's the same editor ;-)
I decided to learn just enough of another editor to switch to that for precisely 
such search-and-replace jobs. All I need to know about this other editor is how 
to load a file, how to save it, how to quit, and how to do a search-and-replace 
over linebreaks. And, very important, how to invoke the help on the 
search-and-replace patterns, as I always forget the details. This strategy works 
like a charm :-)
