Subject: [texhax] Printing "bar code" on document
Message-ID: <20131002135017.2e9daf67@scorpio>

I saw this being done with MS Word and an add-on application. I
would like to know if it can be done with LaTeX.

I work in a small government office that issues permits. The permits
are filled in and then printed out. We would like to print out the
final permit with a bar-code that could later be scanned. Is there a
package that does that?

there have been several articles in tugboat
about this:

 - Another Approach to Barcodes
   Peter Willadt
   http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb18-4/tb57will.pdf

 - The EAN barcodes by TeX
   Petr Ol\v{s}\'ak
   http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb15-4/tb45olsa.pdf

 - Generating barcodes with LuaTeX
   Patrick Gundlach
   http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb33-1/tb103gundlach.pdf

there are also quite a few packages on ctan,
listed at
  http://www.ctan.org/topic/barcode

a somewhat more extensive list of possibilities
will result from entering "barcode" as a search
term at
  http://www.ctan.org/search.html

there are quite a few different "styles" of
barcodes, so knowing which one you need is the
first step.

Well, knowing nothing about LaTeX packages, I typed

	TeXdoc Barcode

into a CMD prompt, and lo-and-behold, the documentation
for a LaTeX bar-code generator appeared.  So yes, it
can be done.

I tried the above (naming the file foo.tex) and ended up with error 
messages about foo-pics.pdf.  Although there is an intermediate output, 
foo-autopp.pdf, with a barcode in it, and the final output, foo.pdf, has 
the lines "foo" and "bar" -- there is no barcode in the final output.

you have probably no Perl installed. Install it from

Thanks -- using \usepackage[crop=off]{auto-pst-pdf} resulted in success 
-- but I do have perl (see below);

The Miktex help system seems to be moribund (I have sent them two 
questions in the past week and gotten no reply) so I will ask this forum. 
How do you update the filenames datatbase.  I know there is, or used to 
be, a simple program to run that would do it, but I have forgotten what it 
is.  The "official" method mentioned in the Miktex tutorial (run miktex, 
the maintenance, then settings then update FNDB) has no effect since the 
miktex engine still cannot find the file I have added and which is 
certainly there.

Can anyone on this list help?

It is certainly where? In the settings window, click on Roots. Click
on "Show MiKTeX-maintained root directories". Is it below one of
those texmf roots?

If it is below one of those texmf roots, it may not be in a suitable
sub-directory.  I don't know whether MiKTeX's search is as fussy as
TeXLive's search but this might be the issue.  What kind of file
is it?

It is in \miktex 2.8\tex\generic\xypic and \miktex 2.8 is one of the root 
directories shown.  The file in question is called xybarr.tex and has been 
newly added as an xy-pic option.

I didn't know about the possibility of adding other directories to the 
search path, BTW.

It's not a good idea to put local or personal files in the MiKTeX
distribution tree. Is there a local texmf root listed? If so, put
your file in tex\generic\xypic below that. If you don't have a local
texmf tree, you can create it and add it to the search path.

That doesn't answer my question.  I can put it into my personal directory, 
but it has now become part of the official xy-pic distribution and I am 
trying to figure out how Random User can use it.  In fact, I didn't name 
it that; Kris Rose did.  I had always called it diagxy.

It doesn't seem to be in the xypic package at CTAN. You'll have to
convince the package maintainer to upload this "official" xy-pic
package to CTAN. Kris Rose is listed as one of the maintainers.
It will then be distributed as updates to the current TeXLive and
MiKTeX.

Click on "CTAN path" for the package. Then click on "Download the
complete contents of this directory in one zip archive".

I don't seem to have any problems

I searched for my interval package

and got

http://ctan.org/pkg/interval

there I clicked the 'CTAN path'

and was sent to

http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/interval

which allows me to download interval.sty via

http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/interval/interval.sty

Perhaps mirrors.ctan.org sent you to a bad mirror?

Thanks for all who helped.  Why can't the help file say the same thing? 
It tells me all about skins and other useless information, but omits the

Perhaps the link should be called "download"?

Absolutely, but I don't see one here http://ctan.org/pkg/interval, being the
aforementioned URL. I do see a "CTAN path" link, but I think that the argument
can be made for that to be a bit unintuitive, which was my point.

More to the point, the first URL is /not/ the one returned by a CTAN
search for "Interval", which returns the second URL cited --

which is consistent with the view of the CTAN maintainers that CTAN
is a site for browsing, not just downloading. But making it easier
for downloaders isn't unreasonable.

Gerd --

Given that javascript is being invoked, it would seem good also to invoke
the incantation for MathJax so that math in the descriptive area is
displayed.

For example, with the page
http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/interval
the following diffs will make this happen:

----------
1c1
< <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
---
> <!DOCTYPE html>
18a19,30
> 
> <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
>   MathJax.Hub.Config({
>     extensions: ["tex2jax.js"],
>     jax: ["input/TeX","output/HTML-CSS"],
>     tex2jax: {inlineMath: [["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]]}
>   });
> </script>
> <script type="text/javascript"
>   src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">
> </script>
> 
----------

The DOCTYPE may not be necessary.  The point is that it flags HTML5 where
math is legal.

Also the first of the two script elements is being used mainly to enable
'$' for toggling in and out of TeX math.  If the preferred notation
\( ... \) were used for inline math the first script element could be
dropped.  If the first script element is retained, there might be a small
advantage in changing the config value in the second script -- for which I'm
not a good person to make the recommendation.

[...]

thanks for the hint. I have not been aware of this library.

Nevertheless it is not that simple since the Catalogue does not define the
formal language of the description element. Links are contained with a special
XML tag.
I would think that an exhaustive analysis is required to see which kind of funny
things are contained in the Catalogue before attempting an automatic formatting
of any kind.

I will put it on the list of ideas to be explored...

(Sorry if my mailer messed up the accents.)


#########################################################################
GUTenberg, the French TeX user group, has just learnt with great sadness
that Jean-Pierre F. Drucbert passed away in March 2009. Jean-Pierre has
written notable LaTeX packages, including minitoc and xr; a complete
list can be found at

  http://www.ctan.org/author/drucbert

We asked some colleagues of Jean-Pierre about his wishes concerning his
packages, but they don't know. Their license (LPPL) allows anybody of
good will to undertake their development.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Born in Lille (France) in 1947, Jean-Pierre Drucbert earned a degree in
1970 in Engineering at the National School of Aeronautics and Space
("??cole Nationale Sup??rieure de l'A??ronautique et de l'Espace").

After majoring in computer science, he joined the "Centre d'??tudes et de
Recherches de Toulouse" (now ONERA) as a systems engineer, mainly in the
field of IT applied to scientific computing. Jean-Pierre installed and
administered several generations of computers (including an Iris 80 and
a Cray XMP), particularly for scheduling of computational jobs.
Moreover, he assured IT support to hundreds of users scientists,
especially in the field of parallel computing.

Meanwhile, fascinated by the sciences of language and typography,
Jean-Pierre showed an early interest in TeX and LaTeX.  He compiled,
installed and configured these on different systems, from Multics to
Linux through various proprietary Unix systems. He offered to ONERA
users a very complete LaTeX manual, including French translations of
many packages' documentation. For more than twenty years, he also
contributed to the LaTeX community by developing packages, a list of
which is at http://www.ctan.org/author/drucbert.

Subject: [texhax] PROBLEM WITH PSFRAG AND MIKTEX
Message-ID: <CAPGonijdnNnq5DyucAT+L5OMAfs3hHK3P+2do-cD=Nf+bB+ABw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I heve been using Miktex to produce my LaTex documents with WinEdt as my
text editor.  I've been preparing a paper with various figures that make
use of psfrag to generate greek letters within the figures by substitution.
I've been using this combination for more than a year. Starting two weeks
ago, when I compile the LaTex document and want to see the dvi file using
Yap, an error message is given by Yap and the psfrag substitutions are not
produced.  When I generate the pdf document from WinEdt, the figures are
there but the letters in the original figures are not replaced by the
psfrag program.

I uninstalled Miktex (basic) and installed it again and it did not solve
the problem.  I also installed the "complete" MikTex but it did not work
either.

I wonder if anyone has experienced this problem. Any suggestion about what
can I do to get the WinEdt/Miktex/yap system to generate the figures
correctly again?

Below I copy the error message that appears in a window when I use Yap to
see the DVI file.

Thanks,


Juan C. Padrino

*GREETINGS:*

I am one of your new members, and, as I am sure will not surprise you, I
have a few questions/problems actualizing your software.
*1)* I am not, nor can I be, connected to the Internet. I communicate with
you *via* one of our libraries. Therefore, I need to be assured, once
again, that I need no such connection to run this software for producing
professional papers. I don't care about *optional* sub-programs.
*2)* I am using *Windows XP* in my computer. I seem to recall your stating
somewhere that I MAY need some special Windows sub-program installed, in
order to get your stuff to work. How do I tell if I have this, and if I
don't where do I get it?
*3)* Your Protext layout seems a great improvement on the WinEdt stuff I
have been  using. But I need some kind of trouble-shooting guideline. I am
sure I will have to buy one or more of your technical manuals, as I
previously (20 years ago) found to be essential. Do I do this through this
website, or elsewhere?
*4)* In the interim, is there such an abbreviated trouble-shooting manual
in what I already have?
*5)* To begin at the beginning, do I need to specify, at the start of my
articles, any "use" of font packages, ANSI installation, etc? Or is there a
default setting for this?
*6)* I notice there does not seem to be any provision for stating
"affiliation" after my name. Do I include this in "name" after a linebreak?
Or what?
*7)* There are a bunch of little downward-pointing arrowheads beside
various line numbers. Do each of these mark some kind of error? Or are
these something more general?
*8)* Perhaps most important, you seem to have a function available to
provide a preview of (.pdf?) final text, for highlighted regions of the
.tex  compilation. I can't get this to work at all. Is there some extra
mumbo-jumbo?

*
THANX,*

AIUI, the only time it makes such a connection is if one turns on the _option_ of automatically loading uninstalled packages.

I'm still using Windows XP on my main machine and I've never needed anything special to run TeX on Windows --- could you quote the relevant text? The only thing which seems possible is if you'd have to d/l and install some set of DLLs or .NET.

I am sure I will have to buy one or more of your technical manuals, as I previously (20 years ago) found to be essential. Do I do this through this website, or elsewhere?

I don't think there's such a document. Starting at: http://www.tug.org/protext/ the only link is to: http://www.tug.org/begin.html

I guess the ideal would be if we could up-date Norman Walsh's _Making TeX Work_ which is sadly out-dated, but freely available here: http://makingtexwork.sourceforge.net/mtw/

There is of course Robin's fabulous FAQ: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html --- I suspect that many of your questions will already have answers there. There is a .pdf version: http://www.tex.ac.uk/ctan/help/uk-tex-faq/newfaq.pdf and I suspect there's already a copy on your DVD --- I suspect the most efficient use of your time will be to read through all the relevant docs on that first.

> 4) In the interim, is there such an abbreviated trouble-shooting manual in what I already have?

If I remember correctly, ProTeXt uses MiKTeX at its core: http://www.miktex.org/help

> 5) To begin at the beginning, do I need to specify, at the start of my articles, any "use" of font packages, ANSI installation, etc? Or is there a default setting for this?

The default AIUI is 7-bit encoding using Computer Modern fonts. You'll want to read up on the packages:

 - fontenc - http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/664/why-should-i-use-usepackaget1fontenc
 - inputenc - http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/novices/html/inputenc.html
 - lmodern - http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=uselmfonts

(those may not be the best links, and you should consult the package documentation in addition)

Please try typing ``texdoc <foo>'' into a command-line terminal to see if that loads the documentation.

Alternately, look through the DVD and see if there's anything in the documentation tree of interest. If you need to install a general purpose .pdf viewer, I'd suggest Sumatra: http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html

> 6) I notice there does not seem to be any provision for stating "affiliation" after my name. Do I include this in "name" after a linebreak? Or what?

http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/9594/adding-more-than-one-author-with-different-affiliation

(I think you want Sony's answer)

> 7) There are a bunch of little downward-pointing arrowheads beside various line numbers. Do each of these mark some kind of error? Or are these something more general?

I believe that those are ``disclosure triangles'' and allow ``code folding'' --- just a guess though, since I don't know what editor you're using.

> 8) Perhaps most important, you seem to have a function available to provide a preview of (.pdf?) final text, for highlighted regions of the .tex  compilation. I can't get this to work at all. Is there some extra mumbo-jumbo?

Which editor / previewing combination are you using? Please provide a compleat description of:

 - what tool you're using
 - what your input file was
 - what steps you took
 - if there were any warning messages and what they were

If you haven't tried TeXworks, I'd strongly suggest trying it: http://www.tug.org/texworks/

I received the texcollection disc that I ordered from you, but am unable to install the software.  My new computer, with Windows 8, does not read anything from the disc.  Perhaps the disc wasn't recorded properly.  Please advise me how to proceed.  I have a slow dial-up connection, and doubt I can keep the connection for over 12 hours that it would take to download proTeXt from the CTAN site.

My apologies, I was trying to be helpful, but some of this stuff is hard to communicate.

I'm not trying to use CS jargon --- as I noted in an earlier message, it's difficult to discuss things w/o a common vocabulary.

If you can suggest simpler wording or vocabulary, I'd be glad of it.

I'm not employed by TUG, and I was trying to be helpful.

I did listen, and I did try to provide useful information.

I didn't address item 9 in your original missive since there wasn't an item 9.

I'm glad to hear that you seem to've been able to work out your difficulties --- it would be nice if you'd show the same patience w/ the efforts of others to help you as you would w/ your own difficulties.

I'm so sorry Will. Not that my sympathies mean anything, but I really am
sorry. His email compounded a general feeling I've had lately so
unfortunately touched a nerve in me yesterday. (Bizarre inappropriate
nonsense.)

I think it's very generous of you to donate your time and effort to help
people on support lists. His criticisms/complaints were just plain off.
Hooray to you for staying above the fray.

I made a recent change in beamer which was supposed to help deal with
some font issues but raises new ones! I'm expecting to fix this in a few
days time: may sort it tomorrow depending on other commitments.

For heaven's sake, do you really need this deprecated package?  It
loads Helvetica and Courier without adapting their sizes.  All these
fonts are incompatible per se, even when scaled properly.

Try

  texdoc wordlike

and you'll see immediately that these fonts can't be used in one and
the same document.  I assume that the wordlike package scales the
fonts appropriately at least, but doubt that the times package does
anything useful in this respect.

And do you really want to use such an ugly font in your presentation?

Using Times in a presentation is as awful as converting vector
graphics to JPEG. 

My favorite font for presentations is CharisSIL

  http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=charissilfont

but it requires either xelatex or lualatex.  And

  texdoc fontspec

is unavoidable.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I think the best thing to do would be to make a LaTeX 2e compatibility mode out of LaTeX 3 (call it 2.3?) which would only include / access known ``good'' packages.

Seems to me the font-specific packages (which are so problematic) are gradually going away as everyone switches to xetex and luatex.

Some people are working really hard to achieve a goal which can be easily
achieved  with M$O?to produce ugly documents and presentations. I don't
think that you want to make this daunting task even more difficult. :D

Subject: [texhax] An expected yet very surprising behavior of TeX.
In-Reply-To: <1034778186.201836326.1382010094311.JavaMail.root@zimbra54-e10.priv.proxad.net>
Message-ID: <1956936787.201845676.1382010467252.JavaMail.root@zimbra54-e10.priv.proxad.net>

Hello all,

I?ve encountered a behavior in TeX that I find very puzzling; it is not a
bug per se since it follows TeX rules (plus, of course, TeX has no bug :) ),
but I definitely can?t make sense of it.

It involves insertions and the pagebreaking algorithm, so I?ll describe them
here summarily to outline the relevant points (the description is extremely
simplified and omits many details).

When TeX considers breaking a page at a legal breakpoint, it calculates the
cost of breaking there as follows (see TeXbook, p.111):

1. cost = penalty at that point if it is <= -10000;
2. cost = badness of the page if broken there + penalty + \inserpenalties
   otherwise.

In case 1, or if TeX encounters a breakpoint that would produce an overfull
page, TeX breaks the page at the best remembered breakpoint.

If there is an insertion, and if that insertion can?t fit on the page and must
be split (because it would take too much of its allocated space), then the
penalty at which it is split is recorded in \insertpenalties mentionned in
case 2.

Now the strange behavior is that breaking might be triggered by case 1 (a very
strong negative penalty), yet performed at an earlier breakpoint because
\insertpenalties is very strong too.

As an example:

    % EXAMPLE
    \tracingpages=1 % So we?ll see the page being built.

    % New insertion class; the third line means it is only allowed to occupy
    % one \baselineskip on the page (so it?ll be split). 
    \newinsert\myins
    \count\myins=1000
    \dimen\myins=\baselineskip

    % Basic, uninteresting output.
    \output{%
      \shipout\vbox{%
        \ifvoid\myins
        \else
          \box\myins
          \hrule
        \fi
        \box255}%
      }

    % An insertion: it will be split after the first line.
    \insert\myins\bgroup
    ins 1\par
    \penalty-11000
    ins 2\par
    \egroup

    line 1
    \vfil
    \penalty0

    line2
    \vfill
    \penalty-10000

    \bye
    % END OF EXAMPLE

Now, you?d think the page will be broken at the last penalty, and line 1 and
line 2 will end up at the top of the page, because of \vfill; but that is not
what happen: the break occurs at the \vfill because there the cost is

    badness (=0) + penalty (=0) + \insertpenalties (=-11000) = -11000

and that is stronger than the big penalty; since the \vfill is discarded,
line 2 is flushed to the bottom of the page because of the preceding \vfil.
Note that the break is still triggered by \penalty-10000, but it is not the
best breakpoint.

If we look at what \tracingpages returns, we have:

%% goal height=643.20255, max depth=4.0
TeX splits the insert and sets \insertpenalties to -11000:
%split252 to 12.0,6.67859 p=-11000
% t=0.0 g=636.52396 b=10000 p=0 c=100000#
% t=10.0 g=636.52396 b=10000 p=0 c=100000#
% t=10.0 plus 1.0fil g=636.52396 b=0 p=0 c=-11000#
TeX considers breaking at the \vfill (and discarding it), and that is indeed
the best breakpoint, but it doesn?t trigger breaking yet:
% t=22.0 plus 1.0 plus 1.0fil g=636.52396 b=0 p=0 c=-11000#
TeX considers breaking at \penalty-10000, which triggers the break but is not
the best breakpoint:
% t=22.0 plus 1.0 plus 2.0fil g=636.52396 b=0 p=-10000 c=-10000

What I find very strange seems obvious to me, but I?ll state it again
nonetheless: if there were no split insertion, breaking at the penalty would
be better than breaking at the \vfill; the split insertion reverses that,
although it is (in this case) totally irrelevant to what happens in the main
text.

The obvious modification to the algorithm would be turning case 1 from

    cost = penalty at that point if it is <= -10000;

to
    cost = penalty + \insertpenalties at that point if it is <= -10000;

so that \insertpenalties is taken into account (it is important), but adds its
weight equally to all breakpoints, and doesn?t turn what we?re all used to see
as forced breakpoints into mere possible ones.

But perhaps there is some good reason why TeX works as it does, and somebody
here among our best wizards can enlighten me...?

(Note that the problem can be easily circumvented; yet I believe it should not
exist at all!)

Best,
Paul

Hi,

I am working on a pure TeX extension for MediaWiki, based on the
existing Math extension, and removing the ML code and calling latex
and dvipng directly.

The extension  works on Linux but on Windows its a different story.

dvipng is hanging when called. The same command line called from
Windows 8 works fine though.

Any help welcome,

Aaron

It is creating the .dvi file, but no mention of 'dvipng' at all.

Hi everyone,
Somebody know if it's possible convert the pdf (compiled with command
pdflatex name.tex) to any picture format like png/jpeg without lost
definition.
I tried with the linux command convert name.pdf name.jpg/png, but I
lost much definition.

Thanks a lot,

It all depends at what resolution you need to view the
resulting PNG/JPG. If no more than screen resolution,
then a simple screen-capture will achieve all you need.
Otherwise Adobe Acrobat has a "Save as" command that will
allow you to save a PDF as (e.g.,) a JPG or a PNG.

PDF is usually a vector-graphic format without an inherent resolution.

To get higher resolution than the default (likely 100dpi) use

convert -density nnn name.pdf name.jpg

where nnn is as large as you want. 200 should be good enough for
most purposes.

To JPEG: no, it's a lossy format.

To PNG: PNG has a lossless mode, but I don't know how to specify it  
using convert (or other tools), see the documentation. However, since  
it's a bitmap format and pdf is a vectorial format, you'll only get  
perfect results for one given resolution. You can't really scale a PNG  
and expect it to keep the same quality.

Thanks Bob, the command  you recommended me has worked. And with 200 was 
enough because I prove with 999 but it not was better.

I'm finding that specifying density makes the output from "convert" better,
but the best result I've had is with "pdftoppm" (xpdf/poppler) followed
by "ppmtojpeg" (not seeing a ppm to png converter).

"Best" in what sense?  To compress pngs, I use optipng.

It's certainly an option but why? The calling conventions for gs are
a nightmare and the OP was already using convert; think of it as a
front-end to gs.

The calling conventions for Ghostscript are very clear, given that you
read the documentation.

Albeit it was almost 10 years ago and it was the documentation for ps2pdf

actually ppmtojpeg is a symlink to pnmtojpeg (compatibility)

Message-ID: <201310240004.r9O04Nnn017354@freefriends.org>

Dear TeX users,

It's well into fall here in NJ, and the nights are getting cold! What 
better way to warm up than to write a newsletter in the warm glow
of a laptop? 

TUG 2013 is now underway at the University of Tokyo. I opened the
conference via Skype, and my Japanese pronunciation seemed to at least
be acceptable. I regret not being able to attend, but the next TUGboat
issue (vol.34, no.3), will carry the full range of papers from the
conference, so I will at least be able to read what I missed.
Meanwhile, TUGboat 34:2 was mailed in August; and TUGboat 33:2,
the 2012 proceedings, is now publicly available in its entirety
(http://tug.org/TUGboat).

We are still discussing possible venues for the 2014 conference,
so stay tuned here for announcements when we know more.

Other news:

* Nicola L C Talbot has created a discount code for TUG members 
  that will give them a 25% discount off LaTeX books available from
  http://www.dickimaw-books.com/shop. The order code is available
  in the TUG members area on the TUG website.  All the available
  discounts are listed on http://tug.org/books, along with lots of other
  book-related information.

More next month, including a wrap-up of the conference in Tokyo, 
and more on the 2014 site. Until then,
   
Happy TeXing!

Steve Peter
TUG President
(on behalf of the TUG Board)

Message-ID: <20131027072146.5f0ddb9d@scorpio>

I don't know if this is even the right place to ask this question, so I
will apologize in advance.

I have just purchased a new PC and installed Win 8.1 64bit on it. I
was going to install the "proTeXt" <http://www.tug.org/protext/>
package, however, I cannot find out if it is 64 or 32 bit. There does
not appear to be any documentation regarding it available. Also, I was
told, but cannot confirm that "proTeXt" now includes "TeXstudio". Is
that correct? I have used "TeXstudio" in the past and would like to
continue with it. I noticed that MiKTeX does have 64bit packages
available.

No idea what benefits Protext offers over more standard TeX
distributions such as TeX Live, but I for one would be very
wary of installing a package where the list of known bugs
is empty and dates from 2007 :

I'm sure it works on Windows 64bit.

I seriously doubt that you have documents that need a TeX engine with
more than 2GB of memory.

I do have some documents that are over 300 pages long. They load slowly
on my 32bit WinXP machine. My new one is much faster and has plenty of
memory so that would no doubt make a huge difference. With that said, a
64 bit application runs faster and more efficiently on a 64 bit system
than a 32 bit application does. I was just wondering why ProTeXt was not
ported to that architecture. I am assuming it wasn't because I cannot
find a 64bit download for it.

So? The TeXbook has over 300 pages. And the machine it was produced on
then had less memory than your phone has now.

You worry too much.

"load" means what? TeX processes documents sequentially. More memory
or 64bit code are almost certainly irrelevant. The difference you
observe is from the faster processor on your new machine.

If you do not have an answer for my question, then that is fine.
However, spouting useless platitudes and references serves no purpose
at all.

Perhaps a more knowledgeable individual can explain to me why there is
no 64bit version of this application. Plus, how does the 32bit
TeXstudio interact with the 64bit MiKTeX I am in the process of
installing? Is this going to result in a system version mismatch error
message? I have seen just that sort of thing before when playing around
with MySQL and different applications.

I have a more than 500 page document ( http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/book.pdf ) and I am running a four year old laptop that is 32 bit.  I have a script that builds the doc twice and just ran it; it took less than 10 secs to finish.  (There are ways to speed up the process of working with LaTeX documents but I don't bother because at this point the choke point is the operator :-) ) .

No doubt a newer, faster, machine with a souped up processor would cut down that time, as would a 64bit MiKTeX.  But honestly, I'd be surprised if it mattered.

> Plus, how does the 32bit
TeXstudio interact with the 64bit MiKTeX I am in the process of

In LaTeX the parts use files for interactions.  For instance, forward references are put in a file that is generated when you run the compiler and later read by other parts.  So for instance the index sorter does not talk directly to the compiler, and another example is that the compiler does not talk directly to the compiler.  It is all done through files.  Perhaps there is some potential for the kind of interaction between components that leads to corruption but I don't see what it could be.

Actually, that list seems to be inactive. So I'll try to pretend I'm
knowledgeable.

Protext installs TeXnicCenter, for which there is a 64 bit version
available (if you're still not convinced that that won't make a
difference):

http://www.texniccenter.org/download/

As for TeXstudio, it doesn't advertise a 64 bit version, nor a
Windows 8 version:

http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/

Complaints should be directed to the authors.

Hope this helps.

I'd be interested if you could substantiate your claims and they do
not match my experience or my understanding.  Concretely, using a
32-bit binary, you often effectively use half the memory (and thus
half the cache) that a 64-bit version would use: pointers are just
half the size.  Given register aliasing, the increase in available
registers on AMD64 is nice, but also not a serious advantage.

Thanks,

Neal

I think that I will just install MiKTeX 64bit installer
<http://miktex.org/2.9/setup>. Now I just have to figure out if
TeXstudio <http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/> which I have used in the
past, and is a 32 bit program, will work with it.

That was going to be my next course of action. However, I am running
short of time so I am just going to stick with the MiKTeX package that
I have used in the past, although I am wondering if the 64bit MiKTeX
and the 32bit TeXstudio are compatible. I cannot find a definitive
answer anywhere.

I will continue to explore why there is apparently no 64bit proTeXT
available. It is not like 64bit computing just appeared on the scene in
the last year. I honestly feel that 32 bit machines will go the way of
the dinosaur and very soon too. I was reading an article just last
month that several computer makers are considering either eliminating
them or cutting back on their production sharply to save cost.

I think you?re right: proTeXt doesn?t say whether it?s 64-bit.

However, proTeXt is just a means of bundling together an actual TeX distribution, namely, MiKTeX, the TeXnicCenter front end, and GhostScript. If you download the self-extracting protext.exe file and examine its archive contents, you?ll discover that it includes the 64-bit installer for MiKTeX, to which you alluded.

If you want to use the TeXnicCenter front end for MiKTeX, you can then directly download a 64-bit version of TeXnicCenter. And it?s not easy to directly download and install the 64-bit version of MiKTeX. 

You may wish, however, to substitute for TeXnicCenter a different editor , e.g., the powerful WinEdt (which works nicely with either MiKTeX or TeXLive), which is 64-bit.

However, so far as I can see, for Windows the TeXStudio front end is only 32-bits.

I found this on a blog while I was investigating proTeXT, "Update: The
current proTeXt actually contains TeXstudio as an editor, and not
TeXnicCenter anymore, but that information hasn't even reached all of
their own web sites yet." I can not confirm if that is true or just a
lot of crap, Do you have a definitive answer regarding that statement?

Also, will TeXstudio 32bit will work correctly with a 64bit MiKTeX? I
have had problems in the past, specifically using MySQL and mixing 32
and 64 bit applications.

    Actually, that list seems to be inactive.

For the record, although the protext list does not get much traffic, the
maintainer (Thomas Feuerstack) is still on it and still around, along
with a number of other people.

If you find bugs or deficiencies in the protext documentation, please
report them on that list, nothere.  I just added this sentence to
tug.org/protext, according to my understanding of what Thomas has said:
  At present, proTeXt includes only 32-bit binaries, but runs fine on
  64-bit systems.

Message-ID: <620FB4B2-C2C2-44BA-9CEF-A2670221916E@frycomm.com>

I'm creating a document as a checklist which places several .pdfs twice per page --- some of these .pdfs have over a thousand pages.

While pdftex is quite able to make this .pdf, I'm not having much luck post-processing it so as to make a spreadsheet of it --- the balance of the clipped pages is interfering w/ such efforts.

Is there a way when placing a .pdf to parse it and discard any redundant elements which don't appear w/in a clipped window?

No. AFAIK only Adobe Acrobat can do destructive cropping.

I use Adobe Acrobat all the time (V7) and from my experience
the cropping is reversible (and therefore not destructive).

The cropping of a placed .pdf seems to be destructive when one saves as an optimized .pdf and turns on some option which enables the discarding of such redundant data --- the problem is, for the current project, it only worked once on an incompleat file, and since then it crashes every time I try to save out an optimized .pdf --- if my current OCR effort doesn't pan out, I guess I'll try processing it in sections.

Subject: [texhax] Curious: TeX and Sustainable Trail Design
Message-ID: <20131028203132.31e01f67@newmain.materia>

I am looking for information about something that has nothing to do
with typesetting, and happened across a 300+ page document on
sustainable design of trails.  In it, is a section on what is nominally
typesetting.  Perhaps people might comment in the event that that
someone building a trail might want to typeset signs in TeX?

* Do not use italic, oblique, script of highly decorative characters.

* Choose "sans serif" fonts (the width of the uppercase letter "O"
  should be 50 to 100% of the height of the uppercase letter "I").

* Characters on signs at eye level should be at least 20mm high (based
  on uppercase "I") if they can be viewed from a distance of 1.5m or
  less.  For each additional 1m of viewing distance, the size of the
  characters should be increased by 10mm.

* Spacing between adjacent characters should be 10 to 35% of character
  height.

* Line spacing should be approximately 150% of character height (135 to
  170%).

* Text indicating name and length of trail should be "tactile" (raised
  above the background of the sign by at least 10mm).  The two
  typefaces most easily read by touch are Helvetica and Times Roman.

It was news to me that "sans serif" is defined by the width of an
uppercase "O" relative to the height of an uppercase "I".  I always
thought it was based on the lack of "decorations" on glyphs.

I don't know about this spacing requirement in the context of kerning.
And what happens with ligatures?

I suspect line spacing can easily be adjusted, if it is different.

Sure, a person can probably cut letters out of 10+mm baltic birch to
produce the trail name and distance.  Are Helvetica and Times Roman the
two easiest fonts to read by touch?  I always thought Times Roman was a
bunch of different typefaces that were similar.

Have a great day!
Gord

It's not.

Correct, the note on the width is to discourage the use of condensed fonts.

They should decompose to their base letterforms.

Correct.

I doubt it.

It's a bit more complicated than that --- I wrote up a bit here in the past (please check the archives) and the best reference is Walter Tracy's lovely book, _Letters of Credit_ --- unless of course Lisa Benaglia's thesis was ever completed. Never did hear how that went.

I just looked, and while she still has a very brief page at a
university in Switzerland, I don't see a mention of a thesis on that
page, or in Google results.

I wouldn't call serifs "decorations".  They serve two purposes:  

  1. They make the narrow glyphs (I, i, l) wider without inserting too
     much white space.  Consider the word "milliliter" typeset with a
     sans-serif font.

  2. Only the serifs allow you to distinguish between an uppercase "i"
     and a lowercase "L".  There are very few fonts which don't have
     this problem.  Their lowercase "L" has a bow at the bottom.  An
     example is Optima Nova.  Hermann Zapf said that without the bow
     one could associate the first 3 glyphs of the word "Illinois"
     with a Roman number... :)
 
 > I don't know about this spacing requirement in the context of

I'm convinced that if you have to worry about letter spacing at all
then you are simply using the wrong font.  Times Roman had been
designed in order to solve problems with linebreaks when text is
typeset in very narrow columns.  Hence it's extremely condensed and
shouldn't be used for anything else.

There are special fonts for signs:

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger
 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451

Both are sans-serif but the latter one does not have the "Illinois
problem".  See also

  http://www.myfont.de/fonts/infos/5199-Alte-DIN-1451-Mittelschrift.html

and, of course:

  http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue

 > I suspect line spacing can easily be adjusted, if it is different.

Yes, but the suggested 150% of fontsize is far too much.  TeX's
default is 120%.  But the most appropriate value always depends on the
actual font.  If you are using TeX for a while, you should be able to
judge yourself.

Definitely not.  They obviously were proposed by a Microsoft Word user
who isn't aware of any other typefaces.  He first said

 >> Choose "sans serif" fonts [...]

and later he suggests Times Roman.  I have the impression that he
doesn't really know what he's talking about.  Everything he sais is
curious, as you already stated in the subject field of your mail.

I really don't need more problems to follow up, but I decided to
forward this issue to the provincial government involved.  I am just
paraphrasing.  It will be interesting to see what their response is.

Something of a sweeping generalisation, surely ?!  "millilitre" typeset
in a well-designed sans font will look just fine.
