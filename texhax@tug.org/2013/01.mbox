In Latex, is there a construction to (temporarily) query what is the font
size currently being used?

\show\the\font is a basic TeX sequence which ought to work in LaTeX.  It 
should be placed immediately following a word that you know ought to be 
in the font you want to identify.  It will temporarily suspend TeX, 
which can be started again with a CR.  It should have no effect on the 
DVI output, but will be recorded in the log file. You can also get at 
the standard \fontdimen s such as \fontdimen2, the default interword 
skip in  similar ways. \show\thefont will drill down to the original 
basic font definition, which may not be the way LaTeX chooses to refer 
to it.

This information is not needed, you may be following obsolete rules 
about asking questions on mailing lists properly, maybe insisted on 
by Robin Fairbairns only, just for the sake of intimidating newbies.
(I do not know what kind of dispersion miktex is, but it reminds me 
of Tux, see above, as a kind of opposite. Or of the Mixtecs, 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtecs.)

Is this a way to find the answer for the OP's question on "what is the
font size currently being used?" Actually, I am away from my TeXbook, 
I believe there is some <m> such that \fontdimen<m>\font is the current 
em size, which may be a good guess ...

Now for something completely different. Thinking of Leslie Lamport's 
LaTeX, in latex.ltx we find:

    \def\set at fontsize#1#2#3{%
        \@defaultunits\@tempdimb#2pt\relax\@nnil
        \edef\f at size{\strip at pt\@tempdimb}%

>From this we learn that  \f at size (in \makeatletter mode, or 
"the token"), expands to a number <p> such that the current 
font size is <p>pt. (Perhaps due to NFSS, not Lamport.)

Also, \@currsize has the same expansion as the most recent 
LaTeX font size command processed in "typesetting mode"
(such as \small).

Hope that helps, or the reader is shuddering

 -- 29 April (according to the Mixtec naming scheme)


P.S.: I see that Mixtecs even live in the United States, 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtec_transnational_migration) 
maybe TUX, sorry, the TUG has Mixtec members who can help you better.

P.P.S.: As Indiana Jones will find out soon, one of the famous
Mixtec codices apparently was typeset with a kind of early version 
of MiKTeX (-5.0.2). Almost at the same time (astonishingly), 
Gutenberg experimented with MaGTeX in Mainz (Germany). 
Today, local announcement codices (such as "Mrs. 15 Ocelot 
will celebrate her 94th birthday on her husband's, Mr. 20 Jaguar's, 
funeral on Friday") usually are typeset with MixTeX.

What I do in this case is create a wrapper document with just those two 
lines (if TrueDocument.tex is the name of your main latex file):

======= draft.tex =======
\PassOptionsToPackage{draft}{graphicx}
\input{TrueDocument}
=======

Another for the final version:
======= final.tex =======
\PassOptionsToPackage{final}{graphicx}
\input{TrueDocument}
=======

Now you only need to call
pdflatex draft
to create the draft version and
pdflatex final
to create the final version.

This has the advantage (in this case unimportant, but in others it might 
  matter) that the auxiliary files for the different versions are kept 
apart, so table of contents matches the contents and not the contents of 
the other version...

Hope that helps,

	Susan

Good question, cf.

    http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#goal

"Describe the goal, not the step".

Before, the OP complained that \infty appears too small. 
He may be trying to assign a different size to it 
referring to \f at size, maybe reinventing the relsize package:

    http://ctan.tug.org/pkg/relsize

It would be interesting whether \larger{\infty} makes a 
(pleasing) difference. 

Good LuX,

    Uwe.

Combining Lars' and Susan's solutions, you can do this from the command
line:

pdflatex --jobname=draft "\PassOptionsToPackage{draft}{**
graphicx}\input{TrueDocument}"

or

pdflatex --jobname=final "\PassOptionsToPackage{final}{**
graphicx}\input{TrueDocument}"

You could wrap this up in a Makefile if you like.

results in 

    I can't find file `RequirePackage...

Better (the shell has a different idea about the backslash 
than TeX)

    pdflatex '\RequirePackage[draft]{graphicx}\input{file}'

or

    pdflatex \\RequirePackage[draft]{graphicx}\\input{file}

Another idea that I actually use (in an analogous situation) 
is replacing 

    \RequirePackage[draft]{graphicx}

by 

    \input{settings}

and using a script with content

    echo \RequirePackage[draft]{graphicx} > settings.tex
    pdflatex file

It may not be better right here, but is more essential when 
the content of settings.tex requires that other stuff has 
been loaded first, according to what file.tex has above 
\input{settings}; e.g. to override settings from other 
packages.

Yet another idea is replacing the option by \thegraphicxoption 
and then do

    pdflatex '\def\thegraphicxoption{draft}\input{file}'  

Yet another: If you really want to enter the option OPTION 
in the command line, with an option to enter "final": 
Make runwithoption.sh containing

    pdflatex \\RequirePackage[$1]{graphicx}\\input{file}    

So anybody might test

    ./runwithoption.sh draft

and 

    ./runwithoption.sh final

And don't forget to think about the /global/ option "draft".

Good LuX,

    Uwe.

back at my TeXbook (p. 433): \fontdimen6\font is quad width, AFAIK same 
as "design size", see 

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_%28typography%29

or "height of em-size" in

 1. Not sure. The OP may have profited from naming the purpose,
    but the answer to the actual question may be interesting 
    in its own right.

 2. Earlier I had criticized that Pierre MacKay's posting did not
    answer the actual question explicitly. In his defense I have now 
    told how his approach can be used to answer the actual question 
    explicitly, as an alternative to my earlier proposal (\f at size). 
    I.e., how to get the font size by TeX primitives rather than 
    from LaTeX constructs. Just in case somebody likes to know that, 
    irrespectivey of the OP's intention. -- Also for a general 
    subject on the list: LaTeX vs. Plain TeX.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Item3: _____ Item4: __________________ Item5: _________

These documents can be several pages long. Basically, what I need to do
is enter the item and then a line to the next item. Since the item can
appear at random positions on the page, tabbing does not really work
well. Nor do tables. I can do this easily in MS Word since it is a
WYSIWYG environment. However, all I seem to be able to do in Latex is
use a trial & error method. I know that there has to be a an easier
way. I can use a "\hrulefill" for the last items on each line; however,
the other ones require more work.

I did find a package "showframe"; however, that does not give me enough
information to precisely enter the line lengths. Is there a package
that is finer grain than that? Is there a package that can determine
the horizontal distance between two points in a document? I have not
even begun to get involved with vertical spacing yet.

Thanks!

Jerry, why can you not use \hrulefill for all lines, not
just the last ?

Maybe I am doing something terribly wrong; however, in order to space
the items where needed I am using the "\hspace{}" directive. If I place
the "\hrulefill" command prior to that command, I get the item printed,
then a line, then a space equal to the hspace setting, then the next
item plus line plus space. Everything is justified across the page. I
do not want that.

I think the only issue is that you're not being perfectly clear about what
it is you want to control.  Are you trying to control the location on the
page for each item, or the location on each line, or the length of the
rule?  Or something else?

It doesn't sound like a hard problem, but which problem is it?

if you do something like

item 1\hspace{200pt}item 2

then try to underline hspace:

item 1\underline{\hspace{200pt}}item 2

I would avoid mixing LaTeX and Plain TeX commands, so why not (e.g.,)

Item 3 : \hbox to 1 in {\hrulefill} Item 3 : \hbox to 2 in {\hrulefill} Item 5 : \hrulefill \par

Would that work ?

You are right, I am not explaining myself very clearly.

Assume this example:

NAME _______________________________________ PHONE: ____________

PROPERTY OWNER: ____________________________ PHONE: ____________

This is probably a bad example. However, assume I want the PHONE to
begin in 5in. from the left margin. I can manually get it all worked
out; however, when I insert the second line, I have to figure the
horizontal line length.

Essentially, what I want to accomplish is saying:

Put TEXT here, then underline from the end of that text 5 inches from
the left margin and then place THIS text, then underline to right
margin. Not every line has every item in the same location and some
lines have 3 items on them.

A formula like: {lmargin + distance to indent - length of text} would
work I assume. I have no idea how to code anything like that. Is there a
package that offers that ability?

I sincerely apologize for not making this clearer to understand.

You should check out tikz.  It should be quite easy to place the text
where you want using a few nodes.  To draw the lines, you'd just
connect the nodes.

you put things into a box to measure them:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{calc}
\begin{document}
\newsavebox\namebox
\newsavebox\phonebox
\sbox\namebox{NAME:\ \ }
\sbox\phonebox{PHONE:\ }

\newlength{\fiveinches}
\setlength{\fiveinches}{5in}
\setlength{\underscorelength}{\textwidth-\nameboxwidth-\phoneboxwidth-5in}
NAME:\ \rule{\fiveinches}{1pt}\ PHONE:\ \rule{\underscorelength}{1pt}
\end{document}

Does something like 

 \hbox to 5in{NAME:~\hrulefill~}

help?

refarding jerry's question, let's go
directly to the problem:

    Assume this example:

    NAME _______________________________________ PHONE: ____________

    PROPERTY OWNER: ____________________________ PHONE: ____________

    This is probably a bad example. However, assume I want the PHONE to
    begin in 5in. from the left margin. I can manually get it all worked
    out; however, when I insert the second line, I have to figure the
    horizontal line length.

for this, since you know the positions,
you can do this:

  \noindent\hbox to 5in{NAME: \hrulefill} PHONE: \hrulefill\break
  \hbox to 5in{PROPERTY OWNER: \hrulefill} PHONE: \hrulefill

    Essentially, what I want to accomplish is saying:

    Put TEXT here, then underline from the end of that text 5 inches from
    the left margin and then place THIS text, then underline to right
    margin. Not every line has every item in the same location and some
    lines have 3 items on them.

    A formula like: {lmargin + distance to indent - length of text} would
    work I assume. I have no idea how to code anything like that. Is there a
    package that offers that ability?

don't know of a package; anyhow, my
suggestion is raw tex, not latex.  but
if you have a good idea of the desired
dimensions at least *some* segments of
the content, you can use this to your
advantage.

I don't know about LaTeX, but the following works like a charm in Plain Tex:


Item 1:$\underline{\phantom{xxxxx}}$ Item 2:$\underline{\phantom{xxx}}$ 

Item 3:$\underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxxxxx}}$ Item 4:$\underline{\phantom{xxxxx}}$  

The length of the underline is determined by the number of x's or X's in the argument of \phantom.

You can use \rule for the lines where you know the length, and one
or more \hrulefill for the lines you want to expand automatically.
You can also put some parts in boxes with specific width:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\noindent NAME: \rule{5cm}{0.4pt}\quad PHONE: \hrulefill\\
ADDRESS: \hrulefill\hrulefill\quad TOWN: \hrulefill\quad FAX:
\rule{2cm}{0.4pt}

\noindent NAME: \hrulefill\quad \makebox[5cm][l]{PHONE: \hrulefill}
\end{document}

The most interesting question for me still is what you want to get. 
"This" and "that" are very difficult to understand when there are 
at least four different things, I even don't understand "text" when 
there at least two text pieces. Also "item" is not clear, it doesn't 
mean more than "thing". I also don't understand indent

One might focus on the case where you say there are "2 items" and 
deal with the other case when the first one has been clarified. 

    NAME ______________________________________ PHONE: ____________

I assume "NAME" touches the left page margin, and the rule at the 
right of "PHONE" touches the right page margin.

"NAME" exemplifies a variable "text-1", and "PHONE" is "text-2". 
Then there are "rule-1" (left-hand rule) and "rule-2" (right-hand 
rule). From left to right, there are spaces "space-1", "space-2", 
and "space-3" between some "text" and some rule. So the line is 
composed as 

    text_1 space_1 rule_1 space_2 text_2 space_3 rule_2

This way we have 7 "things". Each one will have a minimum width. 
text_1 and text_2 will be "given" by each situation, their 
minimum widths t_1 and t_2 can be found by \settowidth.

The minimum widths of the other 5 "things" is not clear to me, 
please specify them. Call them s_1, r_1, s_2, s_3, r_2. You may 
have ideas about s_1, s_2, s_3 that stay fixed for the entire 
task, kind of style parameter. r1 and r2 may be specified by 
templates, measure them by \settowidth or so.

The mimimum widths add to some m:

    m = t_1 + s_1 + r_1 + s_2 + t_2 + s_3 + r_2

Let l be the length of a line according to the page design 
(\linewidth), and let d be the difference l - m (let's hope 
it's never negative). In order to ensure that all the "things" 
fill the line (that text_1 touches the left margin and rule_2
touches the right margin), you must specify what of the seven 
"things" to *stretch* by what amount. In general, the 7 things 
will get *actual* widths that may be larger than the minimum 
widths. For doing this by programming with TeX, you must 
specify *functions* that determine the stretch component. 
A simple approach would be saying that each of the 7 things 
should get an actual width a_i determined as

    a_i = m_i + d_i

where m_i is the minimum width of the thing and the d_i 
add up to d:

    d = d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_7

E.g., you might say that each d_i should be d/7, so each 
thing is stretched by the same amount.

You can simplify the situation by saying that text_1, 
text_2 and the spaces should not be stretched at all, 
only the rules should be stretched, e.g. by adding d/2 
to each minimum width. Or it may be more reasonable to 
say that a rule gets an actual length a_i such that it 
is a "fixed" multiple of its minimum length m_i (to avoid 
that a rule gets much longer than ever needed), "fixed" 
for the line but varying over lines: 

    a_i = f m_i

so 

    m_i + d_i = f m_i,

    d_i = (f - 1) m_i,

    d = (f - 1) (r_1 + r_2)

which determines f etc.

Some posters have already provided the *code* for doing 
something similar, or more abstractly, algorithms for 
determining certain dimensions that could be used to 
meet a specification as above, maybe even the same ... 
this would be the next thing I would like to find out, 
but I must stop now. E.g., why have they referred to 
5 inches?

To summarize, we have an example of the frequent issue 
that intentions may be characterized by many parameters, 
so many that you can't determine them from one or two 
examples. You should also try to state some rules/algorithms.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

I /think/ that I understood.

\def \rulefilledline #1{\line {#1 \hrulefill}}
\rulefilledline {\rulefilledhbox {to  5 in}{Name} Phone :}
\rulefilledline {\rulefilledhbox {to  5 in}{Property owner} Phone :}
\end

I am not convinced that a prolix discussion of whether we are
discussing an 2-variable problem or an n-variable problem really
gets us very far.

Oops. Missed that in mine.

I'm sure Jerry should be able to work something out from one of the examples. It'd just be a matter of changing where the subtraction was done in mine to comply w/ the above.

I want to thank everyone for their assistance. I have been given a
wealth of examples and should be able to figure out something that works
well for me. Philip Taylor's examples might be a little above my
pay-grade, I am still trying  to learn Latex; however, I will definitely
investigate it further.

One more thing: you might find it useful, where possible, to specify
some horizontal lengths as multiples of \linewidth, e.g., 0.125\linewidth

I am doing something which seems to require the availability of

I googled around a bit and found some advice which first indicated that I

acquired a new laptop and a new Linux system, Fedora 17 which I am still

had to switch, for reasons that I won't go into.)

Anyhow  I did

     sudo yum install texlive

and that seemed to work OK.  The advice then said I had to do:

     sudo yum install texlive-inconsolata, texlive-inconsolata-font

but this resulted in the message:

Can someone please give me some (simple?) explicit recipe for getting
the inconsolata font installed on my machine?

It could be scaled using \scalebox of package graphics(/graphicx). The
following example implements a scaled version \Infty that is scaled with
factor \InftyScale. The redefinition takes into account:
* Math styles (via \mathpalette), resizing of the symbol according to
  the current math style (subscript, ...)
* The horizontal mathematical axis is kept (by resizing the symbol on
  the baseline).
* The short form `^\Infty' can be used (by adding curly braces).

Since the line width is also scaled, the boldness increases by the
same factor using this scaling method.

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\makeatletter
\newcommand*{\Infty}{%
  {\mathpalette\Infty at aux{}}%
}
\newcommand*{\Infty at scale}{1.2}% adjust to your needs

What about

      tlmgr install inconsolata

I don't know whether TeXLive on Fedora includes tlmgr (it doesn't on
Debian, unless you install vanilla TeXLive). If it doesn't I can't help
you any further.

Linux distributions don't ship tlmgr because it would interfere with
their own package management systems.  But I suppose that many Linux
distributions provide a command for searching the package database.
Maybe something like "yum search ..." helps.

Ah-ha.  Some progress at last.  Doing "yum search inconsolata"
revealed that I should be doing

     sudo yum install tex-inconsolata.noarch

*That* found a package and installed it.  It also appeared to install
tex-inconsolata-fedora-fonts-svn19721-1.noarch.  So I thought I
was good to go.

But now I get the error:

> ! Font T1/ptm/m/n/10=ptmr8t at 10.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file 
> not found

Zeeks!  What do I do about this?  I am afraid the error message is 
toadally opaque
to me.  Can someone advise me, please?  In words comprehensible to a bear of
very little brain! :-)

Please, always show your minimal (not)working example!

This one works fine with xelatex and lualatex with (vanilla) TeX Live on
my system (Archlinux, x86_64):

<example>
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{fontspec}

\setmonofont{Inconsolata}
\setmainfont{DejaVu Serif}
\setsansfont{DejaVu Sans}

\begin{document}

Hello, World!

\texttt{Hello, World!}

\textsf{Hello, World!}

\end{document}
</example>

Fortune's Rules for Memo Wars: #2

Given the incredible advances in sociocybernetics and telepsychology over
the last few years, we are now able to completely understand everything that
the author of an memo is trying to say.  Thanks to modern developments
in electrocommunications like notes, vnews, and electricity, we have an
incredible level of interunderstanding the likes of which civilization has
never known.  Thus, the possibility of your misinterpreting someone else's
memo is practically nil.  Knowing this, anyone who accuses you of having
done so is a liar, and should be treated accordingly.  If you *do* understand
the memo in question, but have absolutely nothing of substance to say, then
you have an excellent opportunity for a vicious ad hominem attack.  In fact,
the only *inappropriate* times for an ad hominem attack are as follows:

	1: When you agree completely with the author of an memo.
	2: When the author of the original memo is much bigger than you are.
	3: When replying to one of your own memos.

That message suggests that the font was not made avaiable to kpathsea, 
and that
  Adobe times was substituted.  I see that other replies have given you 
more precise answers to your most immediate problem, but you may find it 
useful to let this aid you to recognize when an arbitrary font 
substitution that is supposed to "make it better for you" fails.  It 
happens all too often.

BTW, this \line does not work with LaTeX, where it is a

OK, fine, you have solved the PHONE problem where I could not 
make sense of the 5 inches because I thought an indent of 
5 inches means that 5 inches of the line are blank. 
(And as a German, I underestimated 5 inches.) And Jerry wrote

> lines have 3 items on them. 

In general there are no 5 inches, and other proposals 
dealt with a more general situation, like I did.

Now below is a LaTeX version of the "indent" approach 
(with a little variation of spacing) both for two and 
for three "items".

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Perfectly true (I never use LaTeX, so have no idea which
(Plain) TeX commands it steals).  Here is a LaTeX solution :

	\documentclass {minimal}
	\def \line #{\hbox to \hsize}
	\def \rulefilledhbox #1#2{\hbox #1 {#2 \hrulefill}}
	\def \rulefilledline #1{\line {#1 \hrulefill}}
	\begin {document}
	\rulefilledline {\rulefilledhbox {to 5 in}{Name} Phone :}
	\rulefilledline {\rulefilledhbox {to 5 in}{Property owner} Phone :}
	\end {document}

and here is a far more elegant version that avoids the need for
braces around the "to 5 in"

	\documentclass {minimal}
	\newtoks \hboxtoks
	\def \line #{\hbox to \hsize}
	\def \rulefilledhbox #1#%
		{%
			\def \hboxmodifier {#1}%
			\afterassignment \postrulefilledhbox
			\hboxtoks =
		}
	\def \postrulefilledhbox
		{%
			\hbox \hboxmodifier {\the \hboxtoks \hrulefill}%
		}
	\def \rulefilledline #1{\line {#1 \hrulefill}}
	\begin {document}
	\rulefilledline {\rulefilledhbox to 5 in {Name} Phone :}
	\rulefilledline {\rulefilledhbox to 5 in {Property owner} Phone :}
	\end {document}

Thanks to everyone who responded to my cri de coeur.

For the record, the solution to the problem was (in short) to do:

sudo yum install texlive
sudo yum install tex-inconsolata.noarch
sudo yum install texlive-collection-fontsrecommended

the last bit being the part that got me over that last hump in respect
of an error "Metric (TFM) file not found".

This worked for me, but a couple of respondents indicated that a
more efficient and easier procedure would be:

I haven't actually *tried* that, given that I had got things working and
didn't dare do anything that might put my system back into bozo mode! :-)

Again, thanks to all who proffered advice.  I am particular grateful for
having my attention drawn to "yum search" of which I was previously
unaware. :-(  This is a *very* useful tool!

     cheers,

Subject: [texhax] Latin Modern Math missing \propto?
Message-ID: <50F2C201.3060103@gmx.de>

Hi all,

I just had to notice that the Latin Modern Math font seems to lack the 
\propto sign on my machine:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\setmathfont{Latin Modern Math}
% \setmathfont{Asana Math}
\begin{document}
$a \propto b$
\end{document}

This code prints only ?a  b?, the \propto is missing. Using the Asana 
Math, everything is fine.

I'm using latest TL 2012, just updated, with

This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.70.2-2012052410 (TeX Live 2012)

The log files states that

</home/texlive2012/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm-math/latinmodernmath-regular.otf>

is loaded. Can anyone reproduce or is this known?

Cheers
Arno

A colleague of mine is editing a book using LaTeX which has several hundred diagrams and figures.  His publisher has told him that some of the figures lack embedded fonts.  I know this is a bit off-topic but does anyone know of a tool that will let him identify those figures he needs to work on?

My experience with producing documents that include content produced by 
lawyers is that there is no special style guide. Lawyers often have 
their own preferences and will not deviate far from them. That means, if 
you have to produce legal papers from a range of lawyers, you will most 
likely face significant variance in how they are structured.

Additionally, once legal papers have been passed into statute or law, 
you cannot change the format. For example, some time ago our government 
was faced with the task of digitising all the statutes in our legal 
system. Rather than scanning them all, the decision was made to produce 
a print on demand system. The project failed at least two times because 
of the difficulties associated with the various methods for structuring 
and laying out content. The statutes were all quite inconsistent, 
despite that they look the same.

I would guess, that if you are able to work within a context that is 
consistent, then it may be better to make your own class file. You could 
call on article and make changes to suit your needs.

There at least have been.  You might find something searching ctan:

      http://ctan.org

I specifically recall a discussion on comp.text.tex (back in the '90s I
suspect) which resulted in a style which covered things like the double
verticle rule on the left margin (as used in the US) and leaving enough
margin for binding with the heavy blue cover stock often used for
contracts, affidavits and the like.

But its been way to long to remember any further details.

And it may be a \documentstyle rather then a \documentclass package.

I'm trying to write a script where latexmk will run inside a gnome-terminal.

Using:
gnome-terminal -x 'latexmk f.tex' 

gives a popup window with the error:

using:

gnome-terminal -x "ls"
works fine, so the problem seems to be with latexmk running inside the gnome-terminal.

any suggestions?

gnome-terminal is trying to execute the command 'latexmk f.tex', not
the command 'latexmk' with the argument f.tex.  Try:

  gnome-terminal -x latexmk f.tex

or

  gnome-terminal -e 'latexmk f.tex'

I tried it with 'ls -l' and it works for me.  I suspect the problem is
with your invocation of latexmk.  Is it in your path?  Are you in the
right directory?

What exactly are you trying to do

I usually do not have any problems running latexmk from bash scripts or Makefiles withput the need to specify which terminal it is running inside.

I had thought that there might be a "package" available that would
satisfy my needs; however, I have not come across one. Obviously, I can
accomplish what I want manually, although having a package would make
things that much easier. I was quite surprised to find that although
Latex has hundreds of packages, there does not seem to be one that
addresses the needs of the legal profession. Maybe in a few years when
I actually learn how to write macros, etcetera, I might attempt to
create one.

gnome-terminal with ls -l works fine here too. I can run latexmk from the commandline, so it's in the PATH.
The problem only occurs with latexmk.

I'm writing a script which would launch gnome-terminal and latexmk inside it.

that is not my point, why do you even need to launch a terminal, that is what I do not understand

Besides, running

gnome-terminal -e "latexmk -g -pdf fueq_master.tex"

from a command line works just fine for me, as does this bash script

#!/bin/bash

gnome-terminal -e "latexmk -g -pdf fueq_master.tex"


so please be a bit more specific as to what and why

How is TL installed on your machine? how is it added to the PATH? (which Linux version?)

I use the -pvc mode instead, plus a little extra latexmk conf (such that it does not halt on error)

Then latexmk runs automatically each time I save (no matter which editor)

latexmk is in /usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux/

and my PATH is
.:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/usr/local/texlive/2012/bin/i386-linux:

so the directory is there.

I have no problem running latexmk from the CL.

Im using debian stable

Some more ideas for debugging:

gnome-terminal -e 'echo $PATH'

(notice the *single* quote!), to check whether that's the PATH inside 
the gnome-terminal.

gnome-terminal -e 'type -a latexmk'

That should give you a list of all possible interpretations of 'latexmk' 
within the gnome-terminal. Usually the first of those is executed.

gnome-terminal -e 'pwd'

will give you the working directory gnome-terminal assumes.

gnome-terminal -e 'ls f.tex'

will show you if the file f.tex is found in this working directory.

gnome-terminal -e 'latexmk f.tex' > logfile.out 2>&1

will write all *gnome-terminal*'s output (including error messages) into 
file logfile.out, which you then can have a look at (using more or any 
editor).

gnome-terminal -e 'latexmk f.tex > logfile2.out 2>&1 < /dev/null'

will write all *latexmk*'s output (including error messages) into file 
logfile2.out, which you then can have a look at (using more or any 
editor). The addition of '</dev/null' makes sure latexmk receives input 
(empty) in case it needs that.

Hope this helps,

	Susan

Sounds like a great idea. I will compile a short list of what I am
looking for and forward them onto you. I am busy right now; however, I
should have it completed in a day or two at most.

I'm a bit doubtful anything there will actually be useful to you, given
the other information you've mentioned about your situation, but at
least it is something to be aware of -- a lot of effort has been
expended to create the "topics" on CTAN.

Intrigued, I browsed "topics", tried "b for books",
followed the link to "book-src ? source of a pub?lished book",
thence to "TeXbook : The source of the TeXbook", and
tried to follow the link from "Li?cense : Li?censes that
pre?vent dis?tri?bu?tion".  Sadly it went nowhere (or, to be
more precise, went to "http://ctan.org/pkg/texbook",
which is where I already was.  Where should it have gone ?

Thank you, Gerd : understood, and no problem.
If you are the "topics" maintainer, may I also
report that at :

	http://ctan.org/author/knuth

"The orig?i?nal lit?er?ate pro?gram?ming sys?tem" is in the wrong column.

it makes the "E" of the TeX logo unreadable).

Subject: [texhax] Differentiating sentences in a paragraph
Message-ID: <201301161752.33022.ghaverla@materialisations.com>

Someone asked me today "what the rule is about trailing spaces 
after a sentence ending period".  In formatted text, I just 
assumed the space should be bigger.  In (LaTeX or other) source,
it can be entirely different.

My original assumption was M$ had made some arbitrary decision, 
and everybody is following the M$ wag.  Wikipedia had an 
interesting article on this, and it seems M$ isn't to blame for 
this.  But in the article, is a text fragment like:

  ... better than I.  P. Jones has said that ...

And following the 1 space rule, that fragment is ambiguous.

In terms of source documents, a long time ago someone had 
recommended that all sentences end in a newline, and that
lines be limited to something in the 60-76 character range.

  The first sentence.
  A really, really, ....
  really long second sentence.

If one forces themselves to do that (I never looked to see if 
anything like tidy exists for LaTeX source), it isn't hard to find 
end of sentence in LaTeX source.

Sure, in a UTF-8 world, there could be a special end-of-sentence 
chracter and a special end-of-paragraph character.  Heck, there 
probably is.  But is 2 spaces after a sentence ending period a 
problem to remove (often contrived) ambiguities?

Thanks.

DroidEdit does a good job of editor (nowhere near emacs, though)  which in
combination with TeXPortal takes care of my TeX requirements in Nexus 10.
By the way, TeXPortal is in infant stage, but is good enough to recompile
my documents in Android tablet, if needed.

I am using TeXPortal too. I like it.

Will look at DroidEdit.

In an ASCII world, there is no special end-of-sentence marker and two
spaces became a common convention to mark the end of a sentence.

It is so common, in fact, that Emacs offers sentence motion commands
(M-e, M-a) to move the mark between sentences.  Emacs recognizes the
end of a sentence period by looking to see whether it is followed by
two spaces.  This functionality was documented in GNU Emacs 18.59,
which was released on October 30, 1992.  Version 18.59 is the earliest
version that I found.  Most likely it was added even earlier.

I just found out that vi also offers similar commands ('(' and ')'),
but I don't know how old they are or how they recognize an end of
sentence.

fmt(1) can do the same:
- s   Collapse whitespace inside lines, so that multiple whitespace
      characters are turned into a single space.  (Or, at the end of a
      sentence, a double space.)

It's probably older than emacs 18.59

Two spaces pre-dates the computer world of course. I remember taking typing lessons on a manual typewriter while in high school (50 years ago). We were taught to hit the space bar twice after a sentence. Of course, there was no choice of font, no proportional spacing, and if you hit the wrong key you pulled out the piece of paper (and real carbon paper if you were making a cc) and started again.

No, I don't look upon that era as "the good old days." but I'm perfectly content for TeX to handle the end of a sentence and to manually insert a hard space if it gets it wrong.

There is a good implementation of vi(m) available: VimTouch, which has much
of the functionality of a full-fledged vim. I use it on my Asus Transformer
and it works very nicely, even/especially for editing TeX. Nor do you have
to root your device.

It should have led you to a page describing the license. Unfortunately these
pages are not contained in the current version. They will be there in the next

I have seen this before (depends on various circumstances). Unfortunately I have

It is a trade-off. I would prefer to stick to the underline since users expect
links to be underlined.
Nevertheless there are skins which do not use the drop character. Maybe you want
to use one of these.

Message-ID: <50F78EBA.6010705@internode.on.net>

Greetings all.
I looked through the list of lists for an applicable one and this one
was the closest one to the issue I am facing.
If anybody has reference to a better source, I would be obliged for a
pointer.

I am using Texmaker 3.4 and passing to .pdf with texlive 2012,20120611-5 on Debian Unstable.
I am very much in the learning stage, but have managed to battle through
to creating reasonable articles and am in the throes of incorporating
images within the text.
I have achieved reasonable success with \wrapfig and am presently
looking at \wraptable.

Here I can find no information specific enough to embed and wrap tables.
I have checked out a couple of publications, such as `LaTeX' - Stefan
Kottwitz and `Guide to LaTeX', Fourth Edition, but can find nothing that
assists specifically there, along with googling and other resources. I
can't afford the Packaged set by Goosens et al at present, so I am some
what stuck.

What is the format for placement of a table?
I am confident that I am employing the right format with \wraptable and
\includegraphics, but what do I place within the config. for
\includegraphics? Do I prepare a file with the code for the table, if
so, what type of format? I have already put in the code and can get no
reaction from that other than an error reading that tells me that I have
omitted a { when all are present.
How do I go about this next step?
Thanking you for any time and trouble you may care to take.
Kind regards,

David Crosswell

Nice option. I now have three good editors.

I am not keen on rooting the device, since it is owned by my employer. 
TeXPortal shall suffice in the meantime.

It's a stylistic choice as indicated by the commands to control it \frenchspacing

There're specific commands in LaTeX to indicate if a period does/doesn't end a sentence.

Balanced against the readability argument is the aesthetic one, of nicer, more even spacing.

A sensible bit of editing would easily fix the example in question.

Are you suggesting that all of the ambiguities which might be 
arguments for the requirement of 2 trailing spaces after a 
sentence ending period can be resolved by editing the sentence?

If so, that might be something that diction (of Documenter's 
Workbench) or things like Language Tool could look for.

I cannot see why one would /want/ to remove the additional
space at end-of-sentence.  A book (or text) is for /reading/,
not for admiring as a pattern of black and white.  To my
eye, the end of sentence space, being functional, adds to
the aesthetics of the work; remove the additional space,
and the document looks too crowded.

No-one (in their right mind) argues that the second and
subsequent para. after a heading should not be either
indented or set off by vertical white space; that could
be argued to destroy the regularity of the line spacing,
yet it adds so much value that we accept it as the norm.

To me, a page w/ extra space after sentence-ending periods all-too-often looks like it's full of random holes, as if someone peppered it w/ a shotgun.

It's even worse in the DTP world where the typical way for people to do this is to put double spaces, which is _way_ too much.

I wouldn't object to it so much if there were a sensible way in a typical DTP app to set the spacing of double-spaces to something reasonable as TeX does.

No, it isn't.

Well, as far as I understand, this additional space is customary in the UK and 
the US, but it is not customary in France (thus the naming of \frenchspacing), 
and as far as I know it is not customary in Germany. So although I understand 
its reasoning, it will disturb German or French readers (assuming they are not 
yet too used to badly-typeset texts). For me, that is a perfect reason to want 
to remove the additional space at end-of-sentence.

I know spell checking is mostly useless, diction does not spell 
check.  It assumes the words used are spelled correctly.  But it 
looks for repeated words (but but) and various bad constructions 
(it always complains about "growing an economy").

:  I didn't have enough (or wrong) addresses earlier.

Maybe there is another justification for 2 trailing spaces?

I gather most people read English text, left to right, top to 
bottom (I do).  I have read that some people (speed readers) just 
scan (center of line) top to bottom, and others only look at the 
center of each page.  Might they need the extra spacing to process 
data?

Dear TeX users,

Allow me to be the last to wish you a happy new year. 2013
dawns with new hopes and new challenges.

On the front line facing these challenges are the Board
of Directors, and several positions are up for election
this year. And it's also a presidential election year, 
if you love writing newsletters. The deadline for 
nominations is May 1. See all the details at
http://tug.org/election.


More news:
- www.ctan.org has been updated and relaunched. The new site 
   provides the information and functions of the old site in

   Most of the existing URLs are preserved. If you encounter 
   any problems report them to webmaster -at- ctan.org.

   Thanks to Gerd Neugebauer and all those involved.

- The host tug.ctan.org now resolves to the University of Utah; this is
   now the preferred mirror source for any CTAN site in North America,
   and users should feel free to browse there too.  Thanks to Nelson
   Beebe and his colleagues for making this addition to their
   longstanding CTAN mirror.

   For the exact urls, see the CTAN mirror listing at

You can set up a two column format in your preamble.

Yes, but if i use twocolumn in the preambule, not automatically adjust? 
because if the poem is long automatically step to another column, it is 
true?

Thanks anyway David.

If I understand what you wish, the ledpar package:

http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ledpar

should meet your needs.

Just thinking again of this posting, when reading the mail 
(probably to Arno as well) asking who from around Heidelberg 
will attend the next meeting. 

Well, I have the \propto with Latin Modern under pdfTeX with 
Debian pieces of TeX Live probably 2009. A lot is very different 
here, I am far away from understanding those font technologies. 
My TeX system may be too old to reproduce bugs properly. 
A few months ago I could not reproduce a bug because a recent 
LaTeX bugfix was missing here ...

Cheers,

    Uwe.

PdfTeX is using Type 1 Fonts, hence I suppose the problem is in the
OpenType font.  The only reasonable solution is to contact the
author, Bogus?aw Jackowski (preferably before TL-2013 is released).

BTW, I can reproduce the problem here with lualatex.

 > A lot is very different here, I am far away from understanding

A good introduction is the book "Fonts & Encodings" by Yannis
Haralambous.  Maybe you can get it from your local library.  If it's
not there, ask for inter-library loan.

It shouldn't be too difficult to upgrade.  There's a lot of new stuff
which makes life easier.  You certainly don't know what you are
missing. ;)

hi, zheng,

    I'm trying to use tabbing environment. Does anyone know why the following
    small example does not work??

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    \begin{tabbing}
    [[ 0.         \= 0.01309759  \=  0.01502751 \= 0.03219092]\\
     [ 0.01309759 \> 0.          \>  0.00835272 \> 0.03256197]\\
     [ 0.01502751 \>  0.00835272 \>  0.         \> 0.03284057]\\
     [ 0.03219092 \>  0.03256197 \>  0.03284057 \> 0.        ]]
    \end{tabbing}
    \end{document}

at the beginning of a tabbing cell, and
after a \\ latex looks for a possible
optional dimension to insert vertical
space.  what you need to do is "hide" the
open square brackets in those locations
by wrapping them in braces.

this will work:

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    \begin{tabbing}
    {[[} 0.         \= 0.01309759  \=  0.01502751 \= 0.03219092]\\
    { [} 0.01309759 \> 0.          \>  0.00835272 \> 0.03256197]\\
    { [} 0.01502751 \>  0.00835272 \>  0.         \> 0.03284057]\\
    { [} 0.03219092 \>  0.03256197 \>  0.03284057 \> 0.        ]]
    \end{tabbing}
    \end{document}

Note that it is rather dangerous to call something information mapping since
this name is copyrighted. I tried to avoidit in my package.

I learn something new, by following directions, every day.

I downloaded the limap.dtx file and ran if thru pdfLaTeX
and now have what I needed.

fyi:

Subject: [texhax] Using XeTeX to select fonts
Message-ID: <CA+imRY+84tXb9muCsamQSSJdOZtaN4Aq4iRVeCAHt-MzOnTh-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

I apologize if this isn't the correct forum. I'm interested in
experimenting with TeX and selecting fonts from my Mac. My
understanding is that if you don't want the LaTeX macro support, you
are supposed to use XeTeX. I found the fontspec article that explains
how you do this. I am able to select fonts easily using something of
the form:

\font\hoefler="Hoefler Text"
\hoefler

\nopagenumbers
...

What I would like to know is whether it's possible to select a family
of fonts so that when I select markup like { \sl  <text> } or { \bf
<text } it will select the desired font variant. I'm noticing that it
reverts to the usual Latin Modern fonts for the variants.

Thanks,

-Clint

If you really want to use Plain TeX, then you're going to have to get down w/ the code for TeX itself.

One technique of investigation is to use the \show command, e.g., \show \sl \bye

Or, you can look at the source for the TeX format --- I believe that there was once a Literate version of it prepared --- ah, here we are (I think):

(a reformed Plain TeX user who now uses LaTeX --- David Kastrup I think it was, had a great analogy about using Plain TeX like to controlling a car using sets of reins attached to a car's engine and steering and brake systems so that one couldn't close the hood lest one cut them off)

It seems that the following can be used to select fonts without too
much trouble using XeTeX. Of course you have to override basic control
sequences to do it:

\font\rm="Hoefler Text"\rm
\font\bf="Hoefler Text/B"
\font\it="Hoefler Text/I"
\font\sl="Hoefler Text:slant=0.2"

\nopagenumbers

\line{This {\sl text} will be {\bf flush} {\it left\/}.\hfil}
\line{\hfil This text will be flush right.}
\line{\hfil This text will be centered.\hfil}
\line{Some text flush left\hfil and some flush right.}
\line{Alpha\hfil centered between Alpha and Omega\hfil Omega}
\line{Five\hfil words\hfil equally\hfil spaced\hfil out.}

\bye

Thanks,

Whereas using LaTeX is like trying to drive a racing car
with flat tyres, an automatic gearbox with no manual
override, a steering wheel that decides for you where
it thinks you want to go, with the brakes permanently
half-engaged, and all this whilst wearing a Michelin-man
inflatable suit.

*Before* the Michelin-man lost weight (which, at least in Canada, he
did in spectacular fashion a couple of years ago).

Don't forget the many pairs of add-ons which are subtly incompatible
with each other.

Sir,

Attached is a .tex file which has called for input file "tcilatex".
 Without it, I couldn't compile it, with the messages like "LaTeX Warning:
Citation `weid87' on page 3 undefined on input line 185."

I have no idea what tcilatex is and don't know how to get around to it.

I appreciate any help in this matter.

It's from Scientific Word. I'll send you a copy offlist (it's freely distributable, so no worries about that).

Admittedly, I enjoy such conversations, though I don't think that they
are overly helpful.  If you really want to have full control, you
shouldn't write your macros on top of Plain but upon TeX, the program.

LaTeX isn't as bad as you think.  There are many inconsistencies and
even bugs in the current version, most of them were inherited from an
older version.  I'm convinced that LaTeX 3 will be much better in this
respect.  But it's a good thing though.

Writing everything from scratch is often simply impossible.  If I
would recommend anybody to write his thesis in Plain TeX, you can be
sure that he'll use Microsoft Word or OpenOffice instead.

The LaTeX macro packages are usually quite powerful and flexible.  I'm
using Plain TeX occasionally and I once wrote something directly on
top of TeX, the program (aka pdftex -ini).  Well, there are only very
few situations where it makes sense.  In most cases it's absolutely
impossible to write everything from scratch, just because I don't have
enough time.  Let's take UTF-8 support as an example.  It's supported
by LaTeX for a couple of years.  AFAIK you wrote your own macros in
order to use UTF-8 with Plain TeX.  But people usually don't have
enough time to start at such a low level and there is nothing on CTAN
they can use.

Phil, I know that when you suggest using Plain TeX, you're thinking
about education.  I'm convinced that in a Microsoft dominated world
it's much more important that students learn more useful programming
languages like GNU Octave rather then Plain TeX.  It's quite bizarre
to see that most young engineers don't know anything else but a stupid
office tool like Microsoft Excel, which is just good enough for a
beverage billing in an allotment club.  They are even quite unfamiliar
with text editors, and so on.

The question is not Plain TeX vs. LaTeX but *TeX vs. Microsoft Word.
This is what I've observed.  It's a pity.  But we have to live with
the facts.  I encountered many strange things recently.  Young people
don't read books anymore.  Today one asked me what to put into the
bibliography of his thesis, he gathered all information from Google.

Phil, do you really believe that you can convince a student to use
Plain TeX nowadys and provide appropriate support?  I can only provide
support for LaTeX.  My (and especially his) time is limited.

It also doesn't make much sense to compare Plain TeX with LaTeX at
all.  They are two completely different things.  Plain TeX is a
programming language, LaTeX is a markup language.  Of course, a
helicopter is much better than a dish-washer and a rabbit is
undoubtedly better than a nuclear power plant.

Anyway, without the enourmous number of LaTeX macro packages we have
on CTAN, nobody would use TeX anymore.  It's not my personal opinion,
it's a matter of fact.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I think you should look up the original conversation, it was on comp.text.tex --- readers might also enjoy my ``galley slaves'' commentary which is preserved at: 

http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Comparison_between_ConTeXt_and_other_typesetting_programs

Certainly my observation wasn't meant to knock Plain TeX --- I still use it and as often as not, when developing a LaTeX macro will use a Plain TeX programming style when using LaTeX constructs would be more correct.

For those who're working w/ the younger generation, I'd definitely suggest pointing them at:

http://www.texmacs.org/ --- for a Plain take

and

http://www.lyx.org/ --- for the LaTeX GUI

Subject: [texhax] dvips not reading the map file (tamil/malayalam  omega)
Message-ID: <1359485651.51081ad3aa8b3@webmail.mun.ca>

I am trying to install tamil Omega 1.0.2 in ubuntu 12.04 texlive system..
The install.sh script that comes with the package places the
various files in the texmf tree as follows:
.pfb 	/fonts/type1/tamil
.tfm 	/fonts/tfm/tamil
.sty 	/tex/lambda/tamil
.fd 	/tex/lambda/tamil
.map 	/fonts/map/dvips/tamil
.otp 	/omega/otp/tamil
.ocp 	/omega/ocp/tamil
And does 
texhash
updmap-sys --enable Map tamil.map

After this, the command "lamed file.tex" works fine and the .dvi file is
created.  But, dvips is not reading the  .map files and tries to make bitmaps 
kpathsea:  Running mktexpk --mfmode ljfour --bdpi 600 --mag 3+300/600 --dpi 2100
tmca0bps
mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for tmca0bps.
and hence no .ps output is generated.  Consequently ps2pdf command also
generates an empty pdf file.

The command: kpsewhich tamil.map certainly locates the map file.

I guess the problem is the incorrect directory where the map file is
placed.  What is the correct directory where the .map file should go?
I see the standard psfonts.map, builtin35.map etc  resides in
/fonts/map/dvips/updmap/
Where should I move the tamil.map file so that dvips can read it and generate
tghe .ps file, and then the ps2pdf command can generate the pdf output? Will it
help if I move the tamil.map here and do texhash and an updmap?

By the way, things used to work perfectly in previous versions of ubuntu
textlive 2007.

Any help will be appreciated.

On a Mac, I have never tried TeX. Anyway, the last 
sentence surprises me very much. I believe that even 
on a Mac, you can use Plain TeX or ConTeXt (Mark II) 
with pdfTeX. Or are you saying that pdfTeX doesn't 
work at all on a Mac? Or perhaps you are saying that 
you insist on "Hoefler Text". Be it a Mac or whatever, 
it may need special aptitude to turn an arbitrary 
OpenType font into a font that pdfTeX can process.

What fontspec article? I have looked at the fontspec 
documentation. fontspec is a package for LaTeX. 
I cannot find anything in the documentation about 
using any TeX engine without LaTeX.

Interesting, the quotation marks, especially. 
-- Maybe you have tried to refer to the XeTeX FAQ 
(i.e., confused it with some "fontspec article")

   http://scripts.sil.org/xetex_faq

that indeed mentions the XeTeX version of the Plain format, 
xetex.fmt. Something there may help you -- with your 
rather pioneering research.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

I don't see that.

My tablet (Fujitsu Stylistic ST-4121 running Windows XP Tablet PC Edition) has:

 - Macromedia Freehand MX
 - Autodesk Sketchbook
 - Inkscape
 - Creaturehouse Expression
 - Futurewave Smartsketch
 - ArtRage

only the last might be considered ``fingerpainting''. 

I also have W32tex on it --- now that I have a 32GB CF Card in it, I'll probably re-install LyX.

All of these TeX processors are available in MacTeX, but yes if I'd
like to use a non-native font to TeX like the resident TTF or OTF
fonts, I must use one of these other TeX processors like XeTeX in
order to be able to do that.

Sorry, I mistyped that. I did not mean fontspec (which is a LaTeX
package as you mentioned). I found a primer on XeTeX which described
the font selection in detail which you commented on below.

[ an hour of Googling later ]

I originally stumbled on the XeTeX Reference (*sigh* why was it such
in a pain in the ass to find this?):

http://get-software.net/info/xetexref/XeTeX-reference.pdf

This goes into gory detail describing the \font command and how you
select variants etc.

Thanks again,

-Clint

If your version of TeX Live is not too old then the command

  updmap-sys

creates a log file and tells you where it is.  Maybe this gives you
a hint.  Is tamil.map mentioned in the log?

updmap-sys creates files in TEXMFSYSVAR.  Maybe you accidently ran
updmap already which creates files in TEXMFVAR in your HOME directory.
The latter are used if they exist.

If there is a directory 

  ~/.texlive*/texmf-var/fonts/map

, remove it and run texhash again.

  Reinhard

Hi William,
I'm not convinced that Lyx is the best choice.  IMO it hides too much.
I always recommend

  http://www.tug.org/texworks

to beginners.  Though newcomers are not accustomed to see control
sequences in their source files, in the long term it's better if they
immediately see what they are doing.  In order to see the result, it's
sufficient to press the compile button.  And if they have questions,
it's easier for me to tell them what to type rather than which buttons
they have to click.

Lyx tries to prevent people from reading documentation, which is
definitely a step into the wrong direction.  Nice at the beginning,
but it bites poeple later.

I suppose that the author of Lyx assumed that learning LaTeX is
difficult but in my opinion this assumption is wrong.

Did you try TeXworks (or TeXShop) already?  I can't imagine anything
better for newbies.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I believe that LyX is attempting to address the difficulty which most na?ve users have w/ matching up semantic tagging w/ visual appearance --- most people view code as too arcane to bother with.

I use TeXshop on my Mac, WinTeXShell on my Tablet PC.

Hello!

I have a vexing problem with latex as described in the attending file.

Thank you very much and best regards.

Hello!

I have the following code:

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}
%\input{III1}
%\input{III2}
%\input{III3}
%\input{III4}
%\input{III5}

\end{document} 

YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

\input{III6} is:

\chapter{White noise model's scope II}

\noindent
When one does not know that the ``white noise model'' has a representation in the form of a stochastic differential equation,
it becomes important to know that such a representation exists as it is that representation that allows an explicit form for the likelihood.
In the previous chapter it was seen that the existence of the likelihood has the consequence that the observations are represented
in the form of a  stochastic differential equation. The result is however
an existence result that gives no hint as to the form of the resulting signal. When one is willing or able to assume some integrability
conditions on the signal, one then obtains a stochastic differential equation form in which the signal is a conditional expectation with respect to the observations.
That latter stochastic differential equation representation is known under the appellation of ``innovation representation'' and makes up the next topic.
In the framework of the Cram\'er-Hida representation, assumptions on the integrability of the signal in the derived ``white noise model'' may be difficult, nay, impossible
to justify. It is nevertheless useful to know that the stochastic differential equation representation is related to conditional expectations with respect to the observations process.

 \vspace*{10pt}
 \noindent
The following ``generic model'' is assumed thereafter and assumptions about it shall be explained as needed
as an innovation representation may be obtained under diverse assumptions on the signal and the noise:
$$\underline{X}=\underline{S}[\ \!\underline{a}\ \!]+\underline{N}.$$

%\input{III61}
\input{III62}
%\input{III63} 

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

III62.tex is:

\section{The  case of vector processes: $\underline{X}=S\left[\underline{a}\right]+\underline{B}$}

\noindent
The {\tt assumptions} are those of the ``white noise model''  except that
 $\underline{a}$
shall belong to
$ {\cal{I}}_2\left[\ \!\underline{b}\ \!\right]$
rather than to
 ${\cal{I}}_0\left[\ \!\underline{b}\ \!\right].$
That restriction has its origin in 6.2.1.D above.

\vspace*{10pt}
\noindent
{\bf 6.2.8 Proposition:}
{\em
Suppose that
$ \underline{a}\in {\cal{I}}_2\left[\ \!\underline{b}\ \!\right].$
There exists a process
 $\underline{I},$
adapted to
 $\underline{\sigma}\left(\underline{X}\right),$
whose law is
 $P_B^K$
and a predictable process
$ \underline{a}^K,$
with base
$ \left(K,\underline{{\cal{K}}},P_X^K\right),$
such that
 $\underline{a}^K \circ \Phi_X\in {\cal{I}}_2\left[\ \!\underline{b}\ \!\right]$
and, for
$ t\in \left[0,1\right],$
fixed, but arbitrary, almost surely, with respect to
$ P, $
$$ \underline{X}(\omega,t)=\underline{S}\left[\underline{a}_K\circ \Phi_X\right](\omega,t)+\underline{I}(\omega,t). $$
\noindent
That representation is unique.}

\vspace*{10pt}
\noindent
{\em Proof:} Since
$X_n(\omega,t)=\int_0^t a_n(\omega,\theta)\ \!M_n(d\theta)+B_n(\omega,t),$
one may use 6.2.5 to obtain that
$$X_n(\omega,t)=\int_0^t \alpha_n(\omega,\theta)\ \!M_n(d\theta)+I_n(\omega,t),$$
\noindent
where
$\alpha_n$
is a version of the conditional expectation of
$a_n$
 with respect to
$\underline{\sigma}\left(\underline{X}\right)$
and
$I_n$
has the same law as
$B_n.$
Furthermore
$\underline{I}$
shall have independent components (6.2.6).

\vspace*{10pt}
\noindent
One must now decompose
$\alpha_n$
 to obtain
 ${a}_n^K.$
 One proceeds as in 6.2.5 using the
 $[0,1]$
 with points
 $t_{p,k}.$
One has that
\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha_n&=&\lim_p \alpha_p^{(n)},\\
  \alpha_p^{(n)}&=&\sum_i \alpha_{p,i}^{(n)},\\
 \alpha_{p,i}^{(n)}&\mbox{is}&\mbox{ adapted to }
  \sigma_{t_{p,i}}(\underline{X})\otimes {\cal{B}}
 \left(\left]t_{p,i},t_{p,i+1}\right]\right)\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\noindent
and that
$$\Phi_X^{-1}
\left\{
      {\cal{K}}_{t_{p,i}}
      \otimes
     {\cal{B}}
      \left(
            \left]t_{p,i},t_{p,i+1}
            \right]
      \right)
\right\}=\sigma_{t_{p,i}}
      (\underline{X})
      \otimes {\cal{B}}
      \left(
      \left]
            t_{p,i},t_{p,i+1}
      \right]
      \right).$$
\noindent
One has thus the following situation: on
$\left(
       \Omega\times [0,1],
       \sigma_{t_{p,i}}
       (\underline{X})\otimes {\cal{B}}
      \left(
      \left]
            t_{p,i},t_{p,i+1}
      \right]
      \right)
\right),$ there are two maps,
\begin{itemize}
\item
 the first, $\Phi_X,$ adapted to the range
$\left(
       K\times [0,1],
       {\cal{K}}_{t_{p,i}}\otimes
      {\cal{B}}
      \left(
      \left]
            t_{p,i},t_{p,i+1}
      \right]
      \right)
\right),$
\item
and the second, $\alpha_{p,i}^{(n)},$ adapted to the range
$\left(I\!\!R\times [0,1],{\cal{B}}(I\!\!R)\otimes {\cal{B}}([0,1])\right).$
\end{itemize}



\noindent
      The factorization theorem \cite[p. 443]{jhj} then says that
      $\alpha_{p,i}^{(n)}=a_{n,p,i}^K\circ \Phi_X$ for some adapted
$$a_{n,p,i}^{(n)}:\left(
                        K\times [0,1],
                        {\cal{K}}_{t_{p,i}}
                        \otimes
                        {\cal{B}}
                        \left(\ \!
                              \left]
                                    t_{p,i},t_{p,i+1}
                             \right]\ \!
                        \right)
                  \right)
                  \longrightarrow
                  \left(
                        I\!\!R\times [0,1],
                        {\cal{B}}(I\!\!R)
                        \otimes
                        {\cal{B}}([0,1])
                 \right).$$
\noindent
One then sets
$$a_{n,p}^K=\sum_i a_{n,p,i}^K$$
 with the property that
$$a_{n,p}\circ \Phi_X = \alpha_p^{(n)}.$$
$a_{n,p}^K$ has base
$ (K,\underline{{\cal{K}}},P_X^K)$ and is adapted to
$\bigvee_i  {\cal{K}}_{t_{p,i}}\otimes {\cal{B}} \left(\left]t_{p,i},t_{p,i+1}\right]\right).$
It is thus predictable.

\vspace*{10pt}
\noindent
Let
\begin{eqnarray*}
L_n&=&\left\{(\omega,t)\in \Omega\times [0,1]:\lim_p a_{n,p}^K\circ \Phi_X(\omega,t)\mbox{ does not exist}\right\}
\\&=&
\left\{(\omega,t)\in \Omega\times [0,1]: \lim_p \alpha_p^{(n)}(\omega,t)\mbox{ does not exist}\right\}.\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent
By construction (6.2.1), $P\otimes M_n(L_n)=0.$ Let
$$L_n^K=\left\{(\underline{k},t)\in K\times [0,1]:\lim_p a_{n,p}^K(\underline{k},t)\mbox{ does not exist}\right\}.$$
\noindent
One has that
$P_X^K\otimes M_n\left(L_n^K\right)=P\otimes M_n(L_n)=0.$ One may thus define $a_n^K$ setting
$$a_n^K(\underline{k},t)=\lim_p a_{n,p}^K(\underline{k},t).$$
\noindent
$a_n^K$ is thus predictable and, for $t\in [0,1],$ fixed, but arbitrary, almost surely, with respect to $P,$
$$a_n^K\circ \Phi_X(\omega,t)=\alpha_n(\omega,t)=E_P\left[a_n(\cdot,t)\mid \sigma_t(\underline{X})\right](\omega)$$
\noindent
and thus
$$E_P\left[{\left|\!\left|\underline{a}^K\circ \Phi_X\right|\!\right|}_{L_2\left[\ \!\underline{b}\ \!\right]}^2\right]<\infty.$$



\noindent
That the representation is unique is seen as follows.
Let
$$\underline{X}(\omega,t)=\underline{S}[\underline{\ \!\tilde{a}}^K\circ \Phi_X](\omega,t)+\underline{\tilde{I}}(\omega,t)$$
\noindent
be another representation. Then, for $n\in I\!\!N$ and $t\in [0,1],$ fixed, but arbitrary, almost surely with respect to $P,$
$$I_n(\omega,t)-\tilde{I}_n(\omega,t)=\int_0^t \left\{ \tilde{a}_n^K(\omega,\theta)- a_n^K(\omega,\theta) \right\} M_n(d\theta).$$
\noindent
On the left hand side of that latter equality one has a continuous martingale and on the right hand side a process of bounded variation.
Both sides must then be zero.


\vspace*{10pt}
\noindent
{\bf 6.2.9 Remark:}
Representation 6.2.8 allows one to obtain, {\em mutatis mutandis,} the likelihoods Chapter 4.

The first thing I'd try would be to replace your $ and $$ w/ appropriate LaTeX constructs one section at a time:

$...$  replace with \(...\)

$$...$$ replace with \[...\]

I believe that doing this will allow you to determine where the missing $ is.

Using the begin-end pairs is better style, and allows for more facile control of spacing around display equations.

hello, antonio,

    I have a vexing problem with latex as described in the attending file.
    I am not technically competent, but an applied mathematician struggling to
    arrive at a decent manuscript. Can you help?

the problem is with the math expression in the
\section text of the file III62.tex.

here is what you have (line breaks added):

  \section{The  case of vector processes:
   $\underline{X}=S\left[\underline{a}\right]
   +\underline{B}$}

the section heading is what is called a
"moving argument" -- this data is saved
and inserted (in the book class) into a
running head.  if any command in a moving
argument is "fragile", it will cause a
problem, and not always in an obvious way.
that is what is happening here.

the command \underline is fragile, and the
way to fix it is, whenever it is in a moving
argument, to "protect" it.  this is done by
inserting the command \protect just before
the fragile command:

  \section{The  case of vector processes:
   $\protect\underline{X}=S\left[\protect\underline{a}\right]
   +\protect\underline{B}$}

this should solve your problem.

other commands with moving arguments are
any "section" heading (\chapter, \subsection,
...), \caption, and \footnote.

while the recommendation from william adams
won't solve your current problem, it's good
advice, and you should consider adopting it.
also, i think you would benefit from reading
some basic latex documentation.  some good
resources are "the not so short guide" (if
you have a tex live installation, you can
access this by typing
  texdoc lshort
at the command line, or you can see it from
ctan -- go to
  http://www.ctan.org/search/
and enter  lshort  as the search argument)
and the documentation for amsmath,
  texdoc amsldoc
or
  ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf

good luck.

Sure.  But if they have to use a LaTeX package which isn't supported
by LyX, they have to insert LaTeX code anyway.  Isn't it easier then
if they've learned LaTeX at the beginning?

I'm an engineer and the people I have in mind happily write programs
for microcontrollers in C or assembly language.  This is even more
challenging.  TeX provides error messages, but their programs run on
machines which don't even have a screen.  The problem is that they are
not accustomed to use a text editor.  On Windows each program comes
with its own IDE.

In the humanities the situation is even more difficult.  Humanities
scholars have to prepare critical editions.  Some of them come to our
local TeX meeting regularly.  Curiously, these people are quite
familiar with LaTeX internals and are able to investigate the [l]edmac
source code, if necessary.  None of them would ever consider to use
something like LyX.

So I'm wondering for whom LyX is beneficial.  BTW, a friend of mine
tried to write his bachelor thesis with LyX but gave up quite soon and
created a standard LaTeX file instead.  This was amazing because he
always prayed that the LaTeX approach (typing control sequences) is
completely wrong and control sequences should be inserted by GUIs
instead.  I was really surprised when I saw that he gave up LyX so
early. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

/So I'm wondering for whom LyX is beneficial. BTW, a friend of mine
tried to write his bachelor thesis with LyX but gave up quite soon and
created a standard LaTeX file instead. This was amazing because he
always prayed that the LaTeX approach (typing control sequences) is
completely wrong and control sequences should be inserted by GUIs
instead. I was really surprised when I saw that he gave up LyX so early./

I started off with LyX, but gave up on it.
A few things I found annoying was the table layout, for one example,
where it was standard to have doubled vertical columns and \hlines.
This doesn't always suit and I found a very simple programme called
`Gummi' as part of the Gnome desktop, which had the .pdf pane right
alongside the editor pane and printed out what I entered as I entered
it. It was a tremendous help. When you get immediate feedback like that
you can learn very quickly. I'm now using Texmaker, but once I'm on top
of that, I'll be switching to a straight text editor - probably JEdit.
Staging the transition is helpful, but I don't think obfuscating the
code is helpful, which is all LyX does. At least I didn't find it useful
and I'm not all that advanced. LyX definitely didn't work for me. It
seriously delayed me in getting involved for at least three years,
because of the negative mental connotation of `code'. Very glad I took
the leap however and it has been helpful that it has been a series of
small leaps.

The availability of good documentation was the other factor which
assisted enormously.
Once you have the basic grasp of preamble lay-out, it doesn't take much
investigation to discover what other configuration options can be
applied to gain the effects you need if you have accessible documentation.
Kind regards,

David
