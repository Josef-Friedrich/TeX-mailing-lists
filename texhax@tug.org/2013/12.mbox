I would even be happy with a pdfsizeopt which doesn't rely on
Multivalent.  Sure, P?ter's aim is to provide the smallest possible PDF
file.  I used pdfsizeopt for my job applications a few years ago.
It turned out that converting Type 1 to CFF reduced the size
significantly without any side-effects.  I also tried to use JBIG2
compression for scanned images but de-compressing JBIG2 images is
utterly slow with current PDF viewers.  Adobe Reader cached the
de-compressed images at least, xpdf based viewers de-compress the file
whenever one scrolls from one page to another.  Hence it's not always
desirable to make the file as small as possible.

After all, I'm convinced that pdfsizeopt is very useful even if not
all features are available.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Is there no way to get pdf[la]tex to embed CFF fonts?

No, pdfTeX is frozen but AFAIK LuaTeX converts Type 1 fonts to CFF.
Recent versions of Ghostscript convert Type 1 fonts to CFF too.

You could try

  ps2pdf myfile.pdf myfile-CFF.pdf

The name "ps2pdf" is misleading.  It implies that it expects a
PostScript file but PDF is supported as well.

The drawback is that Ghostscript modifies the pdfinfo dictionary so
that one cannot find out which program created the PDF file originally.

Since Ghostscript accepts both, PDF and PostScript, it's worth to
examine whether the pdfinfo dictionary can be restored easily.  What I
have in mind is to use pdfinfo(1) in order to retrieve the information
and a script which creates a PostScript file "pdfinfo.ps" containing
the information as pdfmarks.  A wrapper script could create pdfinfo.ps
and run

  ps2pdf myfile.pdf pdfinfo.ps myfile-CFF.pdf

I must admit that I didn't test anything, it's just an idea.

Regards,
  Reinhard

My test worked but yielded a *larger* file, presumably for the reason
mentioned by Peter in his paper.

But latex -> dvipdfm produced a file 15% smaller than pdflatex, at
the cost (I think) of giving up microtype features.

While it's not faint, it's easy enough to add

\usepackage{showframe}

to your document, then comment it out when the lines aren't necessary.

Probably it'd be pretty easy to modify the package so as to make the lines light grey, but I've never bothered, just turn them on/off at need.

Wouldn't it just be easier to check and see if the values are accurate and everything is place correctly?

Hello folks.

I am using the refrep class with minitoc and shorttoc
and am having a problem, again, which I thought I had fixed several month
ago.

problem statement:
chapter minitoc do not align with the mini list of figures and tables

i.e. for chapter one, the lof and lot are for chapter two

Table of Contents
1.0 About Start-Up Files and Options

List of Figures
2.1 02-autoexec-test

List of Tables

2.1 Key ideas: Global statements in autoexec

and the last chapter has neither list of figures nor tables


Q: where do I start to look to debug this?

I have turned on the minitoc list files

\usepackage[listfiles,tight]{minitoc}

I am reading my-doc.maf
and see that there are differing number of files produced
but what information is in there?

I need pointers and tips, thank you.

for instance,
what are the names of the variables which control the input of the various
minitoc files?

I have a copy of the first edition of the Latex Companion.  I had never 
used figure before and looked it up and found that among the 14 index 
entries to "figure", not one really told me how to use it.  Yes I guessed 
it was an environment and that \caption would provide a caption, but the 
figure appeared at the top of a page and nothing I could do would put a 
rule under it.  The Companion suggested that there was an option 
\botfigrule that ought to do that, but didn't no matter where I placed it 
(preamble, at the beginning of the figure, at the end), no rule appeared. 
I even tried something like \par\rule{\hssize}{1mm} at the end of the 
caption, but that just led to an error.

I have two questions.  How to add that rule and where I can find 
documention for figure.

The only restriction to their content is that it mustn't occupy vertical
space (or this must be compensable).

For floats appearing in the text you my need to do that manually.
Perhaps packages like float or floatrow can help in restyling floats.

Thanks.  That worked, except I substituted \hrulefill for \dotfill.  I 
really cannot see what in the Companion would have indicated that they had 
to be defined.

The companion is a _companion_ to the LaTeX manual by Lamport (or any

That's true.  The main advantage of Lamport's book is Appendix C,
(Reference Manual) because it's the *definite* reference.  Only the
source code is more definite.

The LaTeX Companion mostly describes 3rd party packages and the first
edition is very old.  I suppose that most of the the stuff described
there is still valid but nowadays a lot of newer packages are
available which probably make life easier.

The second edition is more up-to-date and even mentions Xindy, a
Unicode-aware index processor.  The first edition doesn't mention
Unicode at all.  Though the second edition is almost ten years old
I think that it's still worth the money.

Michael, you obviously use LaTeX extensively.  I'm sure that you can
save a lot of time if you use more up-to-date literature about LaTeX.
I would rather buy a recent book instead of doing thing as people did
in the early nineties.

And whenever graphics inclusion and floats are involved, I recommend

  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/english/epslatex.pdf

It's a pity that we can't have this document in TeX Live; the author
didn't provide the TeX source code.  He told me that he considered to
provide the sources after revising them.  Unfortunately he's
unreachable since that time.

If anybody knows how I can contact Keith Reckdahl, please let me
know.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Dear Friends,

I am working as a volunteer for setting up document classes for the Journal of Bangladesh Studies (JBS).  JBS is published by a non-profit non-government organization "Bangladesh Development Initiative" (BDI). JBS is published in print form. However issues older than 3 years can be accessed via web for free. Currently it is assembled with Word and from now on we would like to typeset it with LaTeX.

So far, I can see that we need two kinds of class files --- (a) standard class file for the authors who will write an article based on the file supplied by us and (b) class file for the entire issue containing a certain number of articles. Each article will have its own bibliography and the author will supply the tex files, image files, and a compiled pdf file. This kind of class files are widely available for different journals and different publishers. On the publisher's end we are required to integrate all the articles together into a book form.

Now here is my question. Is there any standard class file for each article and the corresponding class file for the entire book? What is the best way to go with it so that the process of integration becomes smooth and reasonably effortless.

Any idea/pointer is welcome. I need your help.

Warm regards,

Why would you want individual authors to submit compiled PDF
files?  Does this mean that the "book" will just be an
assembling of those PDF files?  Unless the whole thing is
built from source, your enterprise will likely be unable to
have a satisfactory online presence.

If you do plan to build the whole from source, then, I
expect that you will need to provide technical editing of
the individual sources submitted by your authors.

My suggestion for eliminating the technical editing are
discussed in my talk at TUG 2010 "LaTeX profiles as objects

Message-ID: <201312102355.rBANtRKv009050@freefriends.org>

Dear TeX users,

2013 is about to wend its way into history, and I thought I'd 
use this final newsletter of the year to recap what we've 
accomplished, and where we hope to go in the coming year.  

TUG 2013 at the University of Tokyo was a great success, and I
would like to thank the local organizing committee there for 
doing a wonderful job. Norbert Preining has written up an 
overview of the conference, beginning at 
http://www.preining.info/blog/2013/10/tug-2013-day-1/ 

The next issue of TUGboat, the last for 2013, will be the 
proceedings of the conference. Expect it in your mailboxes
early in the new year.

And I would also like to close the year by thanking the 
volunteer group that puts together TeX Live. Their work
is essential to providing users with a stable, usable 
TeX system, and yet they often get forgotten after the DVD
has been installed. They got the job done for TL 2013, and
they're gearing up to do it all again in 2014.

The annual TUG conference returns to the United States in 2014,
specifically Portland, Oregon (home to the TUG office).
We are working out details with hotels, and expect
to announce exact dates soon, but for now, keep late July free.

We've had some discussions on the TUG Board about trying to
solicit more volunteers. We have volunteer opportunities in
a variety of areas, from serving on committees to heading up
projects to writing up documentation and creating artwork. 
If you have any time at all to give back to the TeX community,
feel free to contact me (president (at) tug.org).

Other news ...

* The LaTeX Companion, Second Edition, is now also available in 
  ebook format, and Pearson is offering a general discount until 
  the end of 2013 (50% which means the bundle of pdf/ePub/mobi 
  will available for $14.99). Details are given at:
  http://latex-project.org/site-news.html#2013-11-02

* Peter Wilson has created a 2014 calendar of Japanese woodblock
  prints (by Hokusai, Hiroshige, Tamenbura, etc.), made of 
  course with TeX, and generously made it available to all.

Why would you want individual authors to submit compiled PDF files?  Does this mean that the "book" will just be an assembling of those PDF files?  Unless the whole thing is built from source, your enterprise will likely be unable to have a satisfactory online presence.

If you do plan to build the whole from source, then, I expect that you will need to provide technical editing of the individual sources submitted by your authors.

My suggestion for eliminating the technical editing are discussed in my talk at TUG 2010 "LaTeX profiles as objects in the category of markup languages", http://www.tug.org/tugboat/tb31-2/tb98hammond.pdf

Dear Friends,

I am working as a volunteer for setting up document classes for the Journal of Bangladesh Studies (JBS).  JBS is published by a non-profit non-government organization ?Bangladesh Development Initiative? (BDI). JBS is published in print form. However issues older than 3 years can be accessed via web for free. Currently it is assembled with Word and from now on we would like to typeset it with LaTeX.

So far, I can see that we need two kinds of class files --- (a) standard class file for the authors who will write an article based on the file supplied by us and (b) class file for the entire issue containing a certain number of articles. Each article will have its own bibliography and the author will supply the tex files, image files, and a compiled pdf file. This kind of class files are widely available for different journals and different publishers. On the publisher?s end we are required to integrate all the articles together into a book form.

Now here is my question. Is there any standard class file for each article and the corresponding class file for the entire book? What is the best way to go with it so that the process of integration becomes smooth and reasonably effortless.

Any idea/pointer is welcome. I need your help.

Warm regards,

I think there are two concerns which need to be addressed:
1. Every author should be able to compile their articles to check they are
working correctly.
2. At the level of the journal, the entire journal has to be compiled at
one go to create one complete journal.

The system of including each pdf for creating the journal will severely
cramp method of using latex to create your journal TOC etc.

One possible solution is to have 2 preambles:
1. You give to the author for them to compile and check their own articles.
2. You have with the journal which is used for final compile.

When authors submit the journals to you, the machine can remove the
preamble from their articles and then just use the preamble of the journal,
thereby creating a nice and simple system for a journal.

We tend to use templates with most common packages in the field, kindly ask the authors not to use any home made macros, plus some extra macros to format titles etc.

Then in assembly, we use docmute to ignore any preambles and redefine the title and author macros. The each article is included in the master.

It does take some work to get everyone to comply to the guidelines, but it works just fine.

For the bibliographies one can use chapterbib.

One thing to look out for is labels. Having full control over the packages used, makes it simpler to automatically prefix all labels. It is doable, but not easy.

Yes, and many journals work this way.  But juggling actual
LaTeX this way is indeed not easy.  LaTeX profiles, on the
other hand, are fully amenable to robust processing by
SGML/XML libraries.  Once the code for a journal's handlers
under such a library for a given profile and a given end
is correct, no human intervention at all should be required.

The hard part will be persuading authors to use suitable
profiles, and persuading them to use profile validators
before submitting their articles.

Message-ID: <21160.63628.680398.507910@zaphod.ms25.net>

Hi,
I would expect that the fleqn option of amsmath has only an impact on
horizontal glue.

Curiously, if the fleqn option is active, there is extra vertical glue
below the first formula of each paragraph and below the first formula
following ordinary text.

Here is a minimal example:

You get correct vertical spacing if you comment out the line
containing "[fleqn]".  The relevant part of the amsmath source code
looks quite innocent.  I can reproduce the problem with TeX Live 2003
too, the oldest TL release I've currently installed.

The vertical bar in the test file is an argument of \smash, hence
both, its height and depth is zero.  Its sole purpose is to make the
extra glue more visible.

Please also note that "some text" in the test file doesn't start a new
paragraph.

Where does the extra vertical space come from?  I doubt that it's
deliberate.

  Reinhard

Examining the log with showoutput reveals that with [fleqn] the first
formulas use of each block uses \abovedisplayskip and \belowdisplayskip
and the others \abovedisplayshortskip and \belowdisplayshortskip,

whereas without [fleqn] all use \abovedisplayshortskip and \belowdisplayshortskip

at least this is the probable location of the extra vertical glue, then
I have not looked at the amsmath code yet to find the spot where this
is is decided,

After checking in TeX by Topic the explanations about TeX's native
processing, I tried the code below with Plain. It confirms that already
TeX treats very differently displays with right or left equation
numbers. The rule to use the short
skips is applied in particular
when there is \eqno or no equation number and
the display follows a previous display; but when \leqno is used
always the long skips are inserted, I presume out of consistency 
for the case
that the previous thing was not a display but a paragraph line; in
that case \leqno forces the use of the long skips, for perhaps
understandable reasons (which I don't understand because an
equation number does not occupy extreme vertical space, so I don't
see why it should be shifted down viz previous text), and perhaps
the rationale then is to be consistent.

[in fact I think vertical spacings in TeX are often too much
and LaTeX pushed this to the extreme with its treatment 
of enumerate, itemize, etc.. lists, including verbatim et al
using trivlist]

So with the [fleqno]{amsmath} situation, it appears that it acts
as Plain for the first equation but then use the short form for the
next equations, creating these in-consistencies.

The question now is: should [fleqno]{amsmath} do as Plain? 

Or rather it is the original TeX thing of pairing the skip above
to the skip below which is disputable? Why should the decision
for using a long or short vertical skip above influence the decision
for the skip below?

it should be fleqn there not fleqno, sorry. With flushed left
equations the rationale for /not/ applying short vertical
skips after a text line however short is more convincing; I
was a bit surprised to see that Plain TeX does this whenever
\leqno is in use, but one cannot put completely in parallel
the Plain TeX \leqno and the flush left equations of LaTeX
or amsmath. 

The flushed left equations certainly have more
convincing grounds for being shifted down a bit viz. last
line of text (except in RTL situations, I guess...)

As an aside, using

\documentclass
% [fleqn]
{article}
% commenting out amsmath:
% \usepackage
% [fleqn]
% {amsmath}

with then the rest of Reinhard's code one observes also 
a somewhat disturbing vertical spacing: in the non-numbered
display the first formula uses the long skips

with class option fleqn however, everything uses consistently
long skips. As the difference between long and short display
skips is much less pronounced in LaTeX than in TeX (I admit
this contradicts my earlier rant against LaTeX's vertical
skips), this looks fine although a bit more spread out
than without fleqn class option

Message-ID: <F50FA4A7-B9B3-4A4E-B4D1-F90E00ADD392@uni.opole.pl>

Dear All,

I am struggling to have both Polish and Chinese characters in one document (Mac OS X 10.6.8). This is the example of my *.tex file:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{polski}
\usepackage[polish]{babel}
\usepackage{CJK}

\begin{document}

%[Here Polish text]

\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{gbsn}
%[Here Chinese text]
\end{CJK}

%[Here Polish text again]

\end{document}

Both the first instance of the Polish text and the Chinese characters are displayed correctly. However, in the second instance, the Polish fonts are broken. What am I doing wrong?

Best regards,
Zygmunt Flisak

but as this creates an asymmetry and
the standard classes always have \belowdisplayskip=\abovedisplayskip
one then feels compelled to do  something like

\makeatletter
\@tfor\x:=\normalsize\small\footnotesize\do
{\expandafter\g at addto@macro\x
    {\belowdisplayskip\belowdisplayshortskip
     \abovedisplayskip\belowdisplayskip}}
\let\@normalsize\normalsize
\makeatother

The values of \belowdisplayshortskip are

<10pt>: \belowdisplayshortskip 6\p@ \@plus3\p@ \@minus3\p@
<11pt>: \belowdisplayshortskip 6.5\p@ \@plus3.5\p@ \@minus3\p@
<12pt>: \belowdisplayshortskip 6.5\p@ \@plus3.5\p@ \@minus3\p@

The above patches however will reduce the initial vertical
spacing when \abovedisplayskip is used

On this matter, there is something I don't quite understand
with LaTeX \[ = \begin{displaymath} 

Try

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{displaymath}
\vartheta=2\pi\smash{\rule{.4pt}{4ex}}  
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
\vartheta=2\pi\smash{\rule{.4pt}{4ex}}  
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
\vartheta=2\pi\smash{\rule{.4pt}{4ex}}  
\end{displaymath}

$$\vartheta=2\pi\smash{\rule{.4pt}{4ex}}$$
\begin{displaymath}
\vartheta=2\pi\smash{\rule{.4pt}{4ex}}  
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
\vartheta=2\pi\smash{\rule{.4pt}{4ex}}  
\end{displaymath}

\begin{displaymath}
\vartheta=2\pi\smash{\rule{.4pt}{4ex}}  
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
\vartheta=2\pi\smash{\rule{.4pt}{4ex}}  
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
\vartheta=2\pi\smash{\rule{.4pt}{4ex}}  
\end{displaymath}

\end{document}

and one discovers that LaTeX \[ breaks the
rule explained in TeX by Topic
 ... The \predisplaysize is taken to be -\maxdimen if there
was no previous line, that is, the display started the paragraph, or it followed another
display;...

which commands to always use the short skips in such a case

The code demonstrates that LaTeX uses the long skips in such
a case and this brings inconsistencies in vertical spacings

The problem is that after \] TeX is in Horizontal Mode...

 (insert \ifhmode\typeout{HMODE}\fi in-between a \] and a \[ )

so the next \[..\] will not execute the conditional above
hence will (compatibly with Plain) apply the /SHORT/ forms

... but the first \[..\] applied the /LONG/ form due
to the code above...

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.03.1312121548210.31433@math.mcgill.ca>

It is not surprising that using the color package, the word Test2 prints 
in red in the example:
\setbox0\hbox{\color{red} Test1}\box0 Test2

But it seems like a failure of the tex grouping mechanism when the same 
happens in this example:

{\setbox0\hbox{\color{red} Test1}\box0} Test2

Adding a group in another place does not improve things:

\setbox0\hbox{{\color{red} Test1}}\box0 Test2

but adding both sets of groupings does:

{\setbox0\hbox{{\color{red} Test1}}\box0} Test2

I got a partial (but not entirely convincing) explanation of this from 
Daniel M?llner.  But is there any way to force \color to confine itself to 
being inside a group.  And why does it need two levels of grouping to get 
it to work?

The following also work:
\setbox0\hbox{{{\color{red} Test1}}}\box0 Test2 
{{{\setbox0\hbox{\color{red} Test1}\box0\relax}}} Test2

Avoid plain TeX.  TeX doesn't support color at all.  The LaTeX color
package emits information to the PS or PDF driver but neither PS nor
PDF is aware of TeX's grouping mechanism.  LaTeX has it's own boxes
which support color much better than plain TeX.

Hi, color is driver dependent, but for example in the case of
compilation by latex, the automatically chosen driver is `dvips'
and one gets:

from 
\setbox0\hbox{\color{red} Test1}\showbox0\box0 Test2

> \box0=
\hbox(6.83331+0.0)x23.66669
.\special{color push rgb 1 0 0}
.\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 T
.\kern-0.83334
.\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 e
.\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 s
.\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 t
.\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 1

[no \special{color pop}]

from
\setbox0\hbox{{\color{red} Test1}}\showbox0\box0 Test2

> \box0=
\hbox(6.83331+0.0)x23.66669
.\special{color push rgb 1 0 0}
.\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 T
.\kern-0.83334
.\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 e
.\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 s
.\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 t
.\OT1/cmr/m/n/10 1
.\special{color pop}

What happens is that \color issues internally \set at color
which itself is defined in the driver file but normally
should issue a command to set the color and then
another one to unset it and the position where this
unset will happen is after the current group closes
(uses \aftergroup)

in the first case above there was no closing brace
in the constructed box, so no group closing was found
hence the \special{color pop} was not issued, hence
the color leak

in the second case it was.

And actually in my test with latex
\setbox0\hbox{{\color{red} Test1}}\showbox0\box0 Test2
has no color leak.

Then there are other issues related to how the "whatsit"'s
as defined by the \special commands are managed

LaTeX has \sbox which has additional opening and closing of group 
for the mechanism above to bring color safety (for drivers
having a color stack)

It is interesting to investigate more exactly what happens
without the added braces. 

Consider

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{color}
\begin{document}
\showoutput
\setbox0\hbox{\color{red} Test1}\box0 Test2
\end{document}

processed by latex (not pdflatex) to use the dvips driver
Here is from the log:

the color pop comes before the color push.

The reason is that \color{red} issued an \aftergroup
but this \aftergroup comes from the closing brace of
the box. Hence the color pop command is issued
*before* the actual insertion of \box0 in the main
vertical list (here we are in vertical mode)

At the bottom we find some push/pop from the \normalcolor
I guess which accompany with the page number typesetting

..\vbox(550.0+0.0)x345.0, glue set 527.9436fil
...\write-{}
...\special{color pop}     <----- this comes from \color{red} in the box *definition*!!!
...\glue(\topskip) 3.16669
...\hbox(6.83331+0.0)x23.66669
....\special{color push rgb 1 0 0}

....\glue 0.0 plus 1.0fil

On the other hand, from 

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{color}
\begin{document}
\showoutput
\setbox0\hbox{{\color{red} Test1}}\box0 Test2
\end{document}

we get the color pop in a correct position, as
explained earlier

..\vbox(550.0+0.0)x345.0, glue set 527.9436fil
...\write-{}
...\glue(\topskip) 3.16669

Hi all,

My name is Matt, and I'm part of Plotly. We've just set up Plotly to
support LaTeX. You can make plots with LaTeX that are: browser-based,
interactive, publication-quality, and shareable.

Here is an IPython
Notebook<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/plotly/IPython-plotly/blob/master/LaTeX%20with%20Plotly.ipynb>
showing
how to do that with Plotly, and here is the graph:
https://plot.ly/~IPython.Demo/309/.

As we're a brand new startup, just three months in, it is wonderfully
helpful to hear your thoughts, advice, and suggestions. Please let me know
if you get a chance to use it, and we'd love to hear what you think.

All my best,
Matt

Hi,

There are two different questions here: editing the document, and
compiling.

For compiling, I have the following in the preamble:

\usepackage{xunicode}
\usepackage{polyglossia}
%\setdefaultlanguage[numerals=hebrew]{hebrew}
\setdefaultlanguage{hebrew}
\setotherlanguage{english}
\setmainfont[Script=Hebrew,Ligatures=TeX]{Linux Libertine}

I then compile with xelatex. Works well.

Editing is more complicated, and depends on your environment and taste,
but basically you need bidi support. What I use is vim within
rxvt-unicode, with a perl plugin for rxvt-unicode that makes it bidi
aware. You could, of course, use another bidi aware term, or a bidi
aware editor.

I also find it convenient to translate the commands into Hebrew, so that
there is no need to switch languages to enter a command. E.g.,

\let\?????=\label
\let\????=\section

and so on.

Best,
Moshe

Message-ID: <5E9F97C3-118E-497F-B68B-76C005AFF4CE@mathemaesthetics.com>

On Sept 10, on this list
(see <http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2013-September/020515.html>),
I asked the following question, but never received any advice or response.

So I'll try one more time.  To wit:

Here's the same MWE code again, unquoted and ready for a quick cut-n-paste:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[paperwidth=11in, paperheight=8.5in, margin=1in]{geometry}
\usepackage{changepage}

\title{FOOTNOTE MARGIN MYSTERY:~A MWE}
%\author{}
\date{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\thispagestyle{empty}
\clearpage

This is the first page's text:~blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.\footnote{This is a longish footnote
for the first page's text that word-wraps at the right margin.
{\bf Notice that the right margin of this footnote is on the right
side of the landscape page, as expected.}}

\clearpage

\begin{adjustwidth}{0pt}{3in}

Now we continue with some text on the second page of the document.
Notice that the right margin on this landscape page
is now inset by 3 inches, because we've used the {\tt adjustwidth}
environment (from the {\tt changepage} package) to reduce the right
margin by 3 inches.\footnote{But in this footnote, otherwise similar to
what was on the first page, it doesn't seem to be subject to the
right margin reduction we thought was in effect via the {\tt adjustwidth}
environment to which the main text is currently subject.
{\bf WHY??  How does one conform the footnote right margin to the 3 inch
inset right margin that the text has??}}

\end{adjustwidth}

\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This really must be something simple, but it sure isn't obvious.

Any help would be muchly appreciated.  Thanks.

That seems to work and makes perfect sense.  I'll have to look at the explanation, as all those 0 arguments in a row are extremely confusing given that they can only be understood positionally.

Thanks!

That didn't work, but only because the footnote's nested "\end{adjustwidth}" needs to be between the last two braces instead of in front of them.  The first brace in my example ended the boldface group.  Once I got that figured out, it seems to work.

But I'm trying to avoid having to do this in every footnote, so the above \changepage solution seems more general.

That doesn't seem like what I want, but I'll keep it in mind.

Again, thanks all.

Despite the the name, the "changepage" package does not change
the page layout, but makes a list-type environment.

If you are adjusting the width at a forced page break, then you
CAN really adjust the page parameters:

\clearpage
\addtolength\textwidth{-3in}
\onecolumn

Now the text and even the page headers are narrower by 3 inches.

Really it would be good if the geometry package remained active
to allow adjustment (using it's own syntax) mid-document.

There is probably some more settings that could be added to "adjustwidth"
that would propagate the indent.  I don't see the point though.

Note that a footnote that breaks and floats to the next page
will not reformat to match that page!  Using \clearpage at the
forced page breaks prevents this happening.

Interesting.  I'm considering adding this to my page

http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/latex.html

but when I go to:

https://plot.ly/~IPython.Demo/309/
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/plotly/IPython-plotly/blob/master/LaTeX%20with%20Plotly.ipynb

I don't see a complete LaTeX example that I could just run.

A single page that guides the LaTeX user into applying your package
(if that is what it is) would be useful.

Hi Tom,

Thanks for your suggestions and for checking out Plotly. We would be
thrilled to be on your site!

Right now, you can add LaTeX to a Plotly graph by wrapping your code in
$'s. So, for example, if we look at this graph <http://plot.ly/~gil/0/>,
the legend is comprised of: $dx=.01$, $dx = .05$, and $dx = .1$. Then, the
x-axis label is $\Delta \Psi$. But then we convert it to LaTeX output. You
can do the same when styling graphs from the APIs <http://plot.ly/api> (Python,
R, MATLAB, REST, Arduino, Julia, and Perl) or from the GUI.

Does that cover it? We were going to add a not to let folks know they could
run it like that.

All my best,
Matt

Message-ID: <CADP=ZZpngTGRdFGiAx6X3xhf9mK-MN-wmUkerVtRYjqr7p=VQA@mail.gmail.com>

When section (etc) title contains mathematical expressions the
corresponding bookmark (outline) in pdf file more often than not requires
usage of \texorpdfstring{}{} provided by hyperref. Unfortunately not only
hyperref does not cover everything available in utf8 but utf8 itself does
not contain everything which is needed. F.e. ^{\frac{4}{3}} does not seem
to be here; even ^{/} or ^{:}.

So, what do you think is the best way to display fractional
sub/superscripts in the bookmarks? Thanks.

Since bookmarks are only plain text (no formatting etc) and Unicode does
not encode any superscripts (the Unicode "superscripts" are linguistic
symbols, not a way to format superscripts in plain text), I think the
only "clean" solution is to rewrite the expression in a way the does not
require superscripts at all (at least for the bookmarks part). I
personally would just avoid math formulas in section titles altogether.

Khaled

There are those who say it is a matter of good taste not to
put math and textscripts in section titles.

That aside, speaking without checking things out, I would
hope that pdf bookmarks are taken from the (toc) option of
\section[]{} and, therefore, one need only provide a toc
version of the title that is free of math and textscripts.

\textorpdfstring is certainly the better choice because there is no
need to distinguish between section titles and TOC entries, at least
in most cases.

What IMO is more problematic is that section titles are usually
typeset in bold face and math formulas are not.  Thus in most cases
it's better to avoid math in section titles.  There is a similar
problem with typewriter fonts too.

  Reinhard

In memoir one can have  \section[<TOC/outline>][<running head>]{<section
title>}

Definitely if section title is long it is better to have a shorter versions
of it for <TOC/outline> and <running head>

While putting formulae in the section titles should be rare, typography
should not have severe impact on content; also there are smaller
subdivisions where putting formulas is more justified

There are more elegant ways of doing this automatically, but the
following will work:

  \chapter{chapter One}
  Blah

  \section{summary}
  \newcommand{\TextOne}{%

  }
  \TextOne

  \chapter{chapter Two}

So the provided definitions should have occupied no vertical space!

Maybe like
   \def\topfigrule{\vskip5pt \hrule height 0.2pt \vskip-5.2pt}

*GREETINGS!*


   I am a recent member, and I have no idea what my # or bonafieds may be.

   Generally, I'm quite impressed with your 2013 edition, and as I am in
the final stages of writing a journal article, I'm getting very thorough
use of your software. Mostly, very nice indeed. You offer a great font, in
"Avant Garde". Too bad it does not seem possible to implement under the
"article" document class. (I guess they are reactionary on uniformity.) And
I am most impressed, of course, by your ability to now stick color graphics
into the body of the text itself. (I have about nine.) But I have a problem
there3, as well.

    Also, for which there ought to be options, I can't find any *general
way* to turn off those bogus ornamental quote marks endogenous to that,
conformist, font. I have to go thorugh the entire manuscript, typing in
\texttt{"} , wherever I want these.

   I don't like the book by Voss. I did like the earlier books by Knuth,
and Lamport. Is there something along their lines for your updated
software? You know, there are people who are vary good at providing
understandable help. And there are people who are very good at providing
evidence of how much they know. And they are generally mutually exclusive.

    Now for my more serious complaints, exhortations of grief, etc.

   Most annoying at present, is that I cannot finish compiling anything
without getting the notice that there is a "required file" which cannot be
found:

tex\context\base\supp-pdf.mkii
 which puportedly resides in some folder named mptopdf. Fine. So I go find
this thing, --- there's a 154kB version, and a 5.19kB version, both in
CTAN. I send these  to "documents" in my C drive. But when I try to
"install" any of this, either from your disc itself, or my documents, I am
told variously MikTex CD/DVI "not found", or that my address is "*not a
local package depository*". So what kind of a catch-22 have you whopped up
here? I'm getting very tired of this notice popping up.
   Similarly annoying, there are three places in my manscript where I sould
like to box off, with a border, pieces of texct/equations. They are
especially important. I've read all of your informative instructions about
what commands to use in order to do this. The only thing I can accomplish
it to either 1) produce a one-line box of text, extending acroos both
columns, and then endlessly beyond, -or- if I put in all the correc [ ]
parameters, I can create a nervous breakdown, in which, apparently very
line of text in the ms. is in error, and it insults my mother, etc.
Suggestions?
   The third problem is in placement of graphics, about which the software
seems very rigid. No time for more on this now.

*                                     Sincerely,*

"implement" means what?  Have you tried

\usepackage{avant}
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}

Again. I'm not going to comment on your taste but you could do

\renewcommand{\"}{\texttt{"}}

and then use \" wherever you want them (assuming you don't need the
original meaning).

This is so confused I hardly know where to start. You seem to be
using MiKTeX, not TeXLive. What exactly are you doing to try and
"install" a single file? If you start the MiKTeX package manager and
enter supp-pdf.mkii in the File Name box, you should get mptopdf as
a package that has that file. It will then install the package for
you.

And I've run out of patience with your tiresome attitude.

In that font standard quotation marks are themselves

Well I suggest you tell us some useful things, such as what
"informative instructions" you read and what exactly you tried,
instead of waxing poetic about your grief. Have you for example
tried \fbox, \framebox or \boxedminipage? Can you show us exactly
what you have been doing instead of describing the symptoms and
expecting us to diagnose what you might have done wrong?

More seriously, some posters have not been aware of what kind
of beings read the postings and what kind of "product" TeX 
software is.

Many of people who read and answer are just TeX users like you; 
however, they have used it for many years and also know about 
the social aspects (while you seem to have dealt with TeX in 
recent weeks for the first time after 20 years). Many contribute 
to the "software", but rather independently of each other. 
This is a "community" of users and contributors to "free" 
software who like to share their "products" and knowledge.

After Lamport, the next step is The LaTeX Companion, cf.

    http://www.informit.com/store/latex-companion-9780201362992

    http://latex-project.org/site-news.html#2013-11-02

The book tells you what the LaTeX Project Team has added to 
Lamport's LaTeX and also about the most commmon packages 
that have been contributed by third-party authors.

However, that book already is somewhat old, and every year 
new interesting, useful contributions appear. For special 
purposes you may need to search CTAN "manually", maybe via 

    http://www.ctan.org

The ultimate description of each third-party package is its 
individual documentation written by its author(s), to be 
downloaded from CTAN. There are also more up-to-date books 
about special aspects of LaTeX such as Voss' (German) bookS.

Before reading *books*, however, has the tiny document 

    http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/doc/usrguide.pdf

been among the "instructions" you have read?

Another alternative to a book where I have found help quickly 
is the LaTeX Wikibook:

To me, this indicates that you are using a MiKTeX installation. 
MiKTeX is a system of making most of the single TeX software 
contributions available to single TeX users. The main reference 
for this is

    http://www.miktex.org

MiKTeX is very useful with a running internet connection. 
Then what is discovered missing is installed on your computer 
automagically. Or at least you can install packages via a GUI, 
without going to CTAN "manually" (without reasoning about a 
good directory on your computer to which to download ...), 
and you can easily install those updates that are uploaded each 
year, month, week.

Apart from at most one person reading your posting, nobody is 
responsible for MiKTeX or can do anything about it. However, 
there is another community of MiKTeX users with their own 
mailing list, similar to the texhax mailing list.

Slightly more readers of the list are responsible for the 
TeX Live alternative to MiKTeX and can do something about it:

    http://tug.org/texlive/

Various instructions have been written by various authors 
(about boxing), and we don't know which ones you have read.
Please list *all of my informative instructions about what 
commands to use ...* explicitly!

More seriously, there are many third-author packages for 
*framed boxes*. Some of the packages listed on 

    http://ctan.org/topic/boxing

may help you. Unfortunately, (i) many of them may be irrelevant 
for your purpose, (ii) for choosing, I am not aware of a better 
way than following all the links that seem interesting and then 
browsing the indidual documentation files, (iii) the "topic" 
is not "complete" in my view, as the "niceframe", "shadethm", 
and "umrand" packages are missing. Actually, the brief descriptions 
of "tcolorbox", "shadethm", and "fancybox" match your sketch best, 
according to some feeling of mine. I found "shadethm" at

    http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#boxes

*Placement* of graphics may be just the problem of placing

suppose you get a tex live disc from a friend.  the friend had it from
tug, and you (an innocent, who last used tex in the 80s) try to get it
going.

you fail, and the friend who lent you the disc suggests you ask tug
about it -- support at tug.org is the way to go.

now support at tug.org is an alternative address for texhax, so you find
yourself swimming in a bed of vipers who are enraged that you think
you're talking to a commercial outfit.

you give up, in the face of only very little information, and masses of
hostility.

as a parting shot, you get a mail saying you "got what [you] deserved".

now, as everyone knows, i was driven off this list for some failure
which i've forgotten about[*].  but i have still read it (and will
probably get complaints about that admission).

personally, i have a continuing interest in the continuing success of
*tex* systems.  i find dealing with newbies "tiresome", but of course
i'm only in the front line (for tex-related things) for users at the
department where i work.  in public forums, i tend to keep quiet, since
most tex users nowadays (who will "answer" posts) know *far* more than i
do.

shall probably attract flak about this post, too.  it'll be a long time

In general, I would agree with Robin that the viperish responses
that are sometimes sent by a few members of this list who feel
themselves so enlightened that it is their right to be critical
of others are something to be deprecated.  However, I suspect that
Robin's message in this particular instance is motivated by
a correspondence that was initiated with the subject "Complaints"
(my belief is motivated by Robin's recycling of a particularly notable
phrase that was used in one of such replies).  And in this instance,
most unusually, I /do/ agree with the respondent that the originator
of the query "got what [he/she] deserved".  The originator appears
to lack all social skills -- he (and I am assuming from the forename
that the originator was a man) /complains/ that something that he
was given free, gratis, as a benefit of TUG membership, does not do
what he wants.  He does not ask "Dear fellow TeX users -- can you
help me with a problem ?"; he /complains/ that this free package
"insults [his] mother, etc.".  I am afraid that someone who is clearly
in need of help, but is apparently incapable of asking for it in
an appropriate way, is highly unlikely to receive the help that

No reply to this after 7+ days - anybody interested - seems a valid issue.

Subject: Arrow head too large on \overarrowright

 

Dear Tug

 

I attach a minimal file containing some code (as shown below) at about line
1200.

 

Near to line 1200

\noindent We would write
\hspace{39pt}$\overrightarrow{AB}+\overrightarrow{BC}=\overrightarrow{AC}$

 

The arrow head is much too big and touches the letters below - otherwise it
would be OK.

 

I tried using \vec but \vec only places an arrow over one character.

 

Is there a way of selecting a smaller arrow head, please, to alter the
\overarrowright?

 

Regards

Keith

Let me just add that I agree and sympathize with this post.  Just a couple 
weeks ago, I got a private email from someone I will not name but is 
either a developer or close to the developers of latex 3 who took me to 
task for having the temerity to use \hbox and \box in a latex document 
(that I had posted here).  He added that I would get my comeuppance when 
latex 3 is released because such relics from plain would be \let to be 
\undefined.  That's not a relic from plain; it is a tex primitive and 
doing that is an act of vandalism.  My reaction is simple.  I will ignore 
tex 3 and the tex community will fork.

But I digress.  Ridicule on this site is uncalled for.  Getting 
clarification is of course always in order.

1200+ lines isn't a minimal file. Just looking through the preamble
quickly I can see any number of possible conflicts. You use color
and xcolor, palatino and times and mathptmx, graphics and graphicx,
soul and ulem, etc.

I suggest you start with this and *add* the packages you need to
make it work.

I think this looks much better:

\documentclass{article}
  \pdfoutput1
\makeatletter
\def\overrightarrow#1{\vbox{\m at th\ialign{##\crcr%
{\scriptsize\rightarrowfill}\crcr\noalign{\kern1pt\nointerlineskip}%
      $\hfil\displaystyle{#1}\hfil$\crcr}}}
\makeatother
\begin{document}
$\overrightarrow{ABC}$
\end{document}

I made two changes.  First, I added the \scriptstyle that made the 
arrowhead smaller.  Less obviously, I changed the \kern-1pt to \kern1pt. 
Could that have been an error?  You can play with that \kern if you like.

Russians have an universal answer: ??? ????? (meaning: "you are fool by

anything from the list

1) "?? ?????" (you are fool);
2) Innocent enquiry;
3) Ditto with a some unnecessary bitching;

5) Inquiry why the hell tabular does not have spreadsheet capacity;

and to anything not in it.

Following my own advice, I find that

  \documentclass{article}
  \begin{document}

  $\overrightarrow{AB}+\overrightarrow{BC}=\overrightarrow{AC}$

  \end{document}

demonstrates the issue. And I agree that it's a valid issue. The
current incarnation of arrows in LaTeX is a disaster. I always use
arrows from the picture environment to avoid them.

If you want to stick with conventional LaTeX arrows, a workaround 
is to insert struts:

$\overrightarrow{\strut AB}+\overrightarrow{\strut BC}=\overrightarrow{\strut AC}$

Actually (this particular case at least) is a difieciency of TeX (not
supporting extensible math accents) and CM fonts (not having accent
arrows). The following example (processed by LuaTeX or XeTeX) looks
good, IMO:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
\setmathfont{XITS Math}
\begin{document}

$\overrightarrow{AB}+\overrightarrow{BC}=\overrightarrow{AC}$

\end{document}

On a second thought, I think this limitation is not crucial here, with
stix package you get the same, IMO, nice looking arrows even with
PDFTeX.

Subject: [texhax] Labels and References with "varioref"
Message-ID: <20131229103132.58b59949@scorpio>

I don't know id this is the right place to ask this question, but it is
as good as any to start with. I am trying to learn how "LaTeX" and use
it as a possible replacement for MS Word. In the following example, I
am trying to create proper references to items in numbered lists. I
don't explain things to well, so I apologize in advance.

I am using the "varioref" package to create labels and references. I
need to get items create with

\begin{enumerate}
\item bla bla bla
\end{enumerate}

referenced correctly.

In the following example I need to get the label named in line 11
correctly referenced on line 13.

\begin{enumerate}
\item this is item 1
\item This is item 2
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item this is item 2A
  \item This is item 2B
  \end{enumerate}
\item This is item 3
\item this is item 4
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item This is item 4A \label{itm:4A}
  \end{enumerate}
\item This is item 5 which is suppose to reference \vref{itm:4A}
\end{enumerate}

The problem is that (1) it only prints out "A"  and not "item 4A". I
added this to the preamble, but it doesn't help.

\labelformat{enumi}{item~#1}
\labelformat{enumii}{item~#1}
\labelformat{enumiii}{item~#1}
\labelformat{enumiiii}{item~#1}

This may not seem like a huge problem, but these lists are used in
legal documents and can be quite lengthy and several levels deep. I
need the reference to be more precise than just printing out a vague
letter or number that can refer to several placed in the section.

You just have to add "item", as in "reference item~\vref{itm:4A}".

No, you do not understand. It prints out "item", but it does not print
out the correct item umber. Instead of, in this case, printing out
"item 4A", it prints out "item A" which can be ambiguous.

I'm not sure it is a good idea to store the term 'item' inside the stored label.

That means you cannot write

>From items (2) and (4) we get...

using references.

If you remove the \formatlabel stuff, then

 \vref{itm:4A}

comes out as

4a

as expected.

I tend to use the quite old fancyref package to solve this, it will react to prefixed labels and you could get

\fref{itm:4A} to return the equivalent to

item~\vref{itm:4A}

fancyref is old school, crude, but it works.

Obviously an original poster meant \vref{itm:4} rather than item

Since I do not use varioref but enumitem package I could be mistaken

Methinks you are comparing apple to oranges. If I got email like this I

Victor, go back to the original post, the OP messes with \labelformat to make it print 'item', that messes with stuff.

No, you do not understand. It prints out "item", but it does not print
out the correct item umber. Instead of, in this case, printing out
"item 4A", it prints out "item A" which can be ambiguous.

I thought that was a typo.  But it does generate 4a if you latex until
it stops telling you to "Rerun to get cross-references right".  Or you
haven't put the \label in the right place.

I like this better:

    \stackrel{\,\longrightarrow}{AB}

If amsmath is used, I think \overset is preferred to \stackrel although
here I don't see a difference.

Subject: [texhax] arrowheads (was Arrow head too large ... )
Message-ID: <52c083a1.LIzfDaIWHxA/8A2x%rdt@cs.queensu.ca>


It seems the current arrowheads in LaTeX date back to 1992 when
Knuth "improved the arrows, which now are darker and have larger
arrowheads, so that they don't disappear so easily after xeroxing."
Unfortunately, he also said "these fonts are never going to change
again."

So, if, like me, you can't tolerate them (even if \overrightarrow
isn't in use), then you have to use arrows from elsewhere. Here's
the sort of thing I use:

\renewcommand{\rightarrow}{{\,\raisebox{0.58ex}{%
\begin{picture}(6,5)
\put(0,0){\vector(1,0){10}}
\end{picture}
}\,}}

This will work with \overrightarrow, but in some circumstances you
may have to fiddle.

No doubt it can be improved upon and getting arrows from packages
like pstricks and tikz are alternatives.

It isn't "LaTeX" per se, but the computer modern font.

At one time Don Knuth found his arrow heads disappeared on
photocopying, so he revised the computer modern fonts to have
enlarged arrow heads, but didn't even change the character
dimensions to match.  This sort of misguided backwards compatability
is all too common, and makes a mess of things for years.

Michael, did you read the original message at all?  Why didn't you
respond yourself?  It's always easy to complain about others.

And as long as many people spend a significant amount of their spare
time in order to help other people it's definitely not justified to

Michael,
I'm amazed that you misunderstood my response comptetely.  I wrote the
mail in order to clarify things and in the expectation that it's
helpful for you.  I only described technical considerations, no
ridicule or polemics are involved at all.

You tried \setbox0\hbox{{...}} \box0 and wondered why curly braces
have no effect on color.

I tried to explain that TeX isn't aware of colors at all and that PS
and PDF have their own grouping mechanisms.  LaTeX takes this into
account but you have to use LaTeX macros instead of TeX primitives.
It's a matter of fact that LaTeX is more sophisticated.

I'm not involved in LaTeX development.  I mentioned LaTeX 3 because
I'm convinced that providing a powerful macro language and disabling
TeX primitives avoids this kind of confusion.  LaTeX2e doesn't provide
such a language and therefore cannot disable TeX primitives.  This
often leads to the wrong assumption that it's a matter of taste
whether to use LaTeX macros, plain TeX macros, or TeX primitives.
But it's definitely *not* a matter of taste.

If you are using TeX primitives instead of LaTeX macros you certainly
lose parts of LaTeX's functionality.  That's what I tried to explain.
LaTeX's color support is quite complex.  You certainly understand this
better if you see how much effort was necessary add color support to
the LaTeX kernel and the graphics drivers.

I supposed that you expected another answer but I cannot simply
ignore the facts.  If you insist on TeX primitives I can't offer a
simple and reliable solution.  Sorry.

You said:

 > it is a tex primitive and doing that is an act of vandalism.

These are your words, not mine.  I never said this and I never had
this or anything similar in mind.  Don't blame me.  Michael, this is
your own invention.  I'm clueless.  Did you *deliberately*
misunderstood everything I said only because you are unhappy with the
answer you got?
 
Please read my mail more carefully once again.  It describes technical
details and it doesn't contain ridicule or polemics at all.  What, on
earth, is the reason for your complaint?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Reinhard's response raises in me 2 questions (apart of the question of
etiquette which I suspect could be discussed longer than the developments
of LaTeX 3, industrial use of controlled fusion and fixing all bugs in MSW
combined):


1) In particular: I use very seldom hbox to avoid breakage of lines in
multiline environment (f.e. in the title of the chapter) or  for some other
exotic reasons (example below) when everything else I tried failed. What
one can do instead?

2) How in general distinguish truly LaTeX macros?

Victor Ivrii


Example:

I wanted a kind of multiline but with right hand expressions aligned by
their left (so no multiline with \shoveright{}) but I wanted the
``overlapping'' of the left and rich hand expressions (so normal align
would not work). I cannot recall  how I found solution below but it
produced result I wanted:

I'd have to say that the over-arrows in amsmath aren't very good,
but the major failing is with the arrow characters in the computer
modern font.  At one point, historically, the designer changed them
to use bigger fatter arrow heads.  I can't say if the AMS \overrightarrow
command was designed based on the original (better) arrows, or
if it is just badly executed.

The first recommendation is to use a different font set, if that
appeals to you.  Perhaps \usepackage{txfonts}.  But beware that the
same arrow characters got imported into some unrelated fonts.

Other than that (or in addition) put the following definitions into
a file, say fixamsarrow.sty, and then \usepackage{amsmath,fixamsarrow}

\def\overarrow@#1#2#3{\vbox{%
 \ialign{##\crcr#1{\smaller at than#2}\crcr
 \noalign{\nointerlineskip\kern.12ex}$\m at th\hfil#2#3\hfil$\crcr}}}
\def\smaller at than#1{\ifx\scriptstyle#1\scriptscriptstyle\else
  \ifx\scriptscriptstyle#1\scriptscriptstyle\else
  \scriptstyle\fi\fi}

The third shortcoming is that the arrows are not shifted based on
the slant of the letters, but correcting that is tricky and prone
to errors, so I'll say to just live with it.

Hope this helps.

I should point out that ordinary LaTeX document classes without
packages do print the full hierarchical label for \ref to nested
enumeration items (but without the word "item").  The format is
set by the \p at enumi ... \p at enumiv macros.

>> \labelformat{enumi}{item~#1}

In fact, varioref's \labelformat command merely redefines \p at xxxxx
(without the need for \makeatletter).  The clear problem here is
you've completely replaced the existing prefixes (that's what the "p@"
signifies) with "item~", losing the nesting context that was already
there. (Maybe varioref should provide a way of adding text).

\labelformat{enumii}{item~\theenumi#1}
\labelformat{enumiii}{item~\theenumi(\theenumii)#1}
\labelformat{enumiv}{item~\theenumi(\theenumii)\theenumiii#1}

% NOTE "enumiv" not "enumiiii"!!!

Isn't also one of the goals of ltx3 to separate the user interface from the implementation?

Such that there are macros that the end users are suppose to use, and macros (presumably including tex primatives) that package authors can use.

Factually accurate, but hardly satisfactory.  If LaTeX 3 is to
be a new language which does not carry with it the legacy of
TeX primitives, then it should also have a new syntax so that
its macros can be immediately distinguishable from TeX primitives.

Thanks, Ulrike! I weeded out all hboxes and it worked like a charm and now
I feel much better (not eating a beefsteak  at vegans convention) and safer
(for LaTeX3 coming).

I hoped that there could be a kind of script like LaTeX validator. If
someone uses 4 \\over 3 f.e. LaTeX complains:

Package amsmath Warning: Foreign command \over;
(amsmath)                \frac or \genfrac should be used instead
(amsmath)                 on input line ***


but never for \hbox usage (overfull is a different matter)

Well one could also use \show to identify the primitives

Latex 3 commands can be easily recognized. It also copies and hides
TeX primitives so when latex 3 takes over (will be a real format)
things like \hbox will no longer refer to tex primitives but are
either undefined or user commands. See the documentation source3.

But currently nothing prevents people from using (inadvertendly or
by intention) tex primitives.

Hi,

Here is a not thoroughly tested attempt as a LaTeX command:

\documentclass{article}

\makeatletter

\newcommand\IfPrimitive [1]{%
     \expandafter\def\expandafter\IfPrimitive at a\expandafter{\string #1}%
     \expandafter\def\expandafter\IfPrimitive at b\expandafter{\meaning #1}%
     \ifx\IfPrimitive at a\IfPrimitive at b
     \expandafter\@firstoftwo\else\expandafter\@secondoftwo\fi }

\newcommand\SayifPrimitive [1]{\IfPrimitive {#1}%
    {\string#1 is a primitive}%
    {\string#1 isn't a primitive}}

\makeatother

\begin{document}

\ttfamily

\makeatletter
\@tfor\x:=a\hrule\begin\string\meaning\empty\hbox\end\x\catcode%
          \mbox\par\if\clearpage\endgraf\ifcase$\equation\vfill\eqno\pageno
\do {\expandafter\SayifPrimitive\x\par }
\makeatother

\end{document}

Best,
Jean-Fran?ois

Donald: I agree about the CM font but the \overrightarrow macro in
non-AMS styles is even worse than in AMS styles; your redefinition
of \overarrow won't help in, say, article. And you've omitted a
definition of \m at th.

Recommending the txfonts in their original form isn't a good idea.
Michael Sharpe's newtxmath package will give better results overall.

I've put in a fair bit of effort in the past to help Dr. Corbet and was ``rewarded'' by him heaping abuse and complaints on me (see the ``ANAGNORESIS'' thread).

FWIW, I don't believe he subscribes, so the only missives which he'll receive are those which were directly addressed to him, which seems to only be the helpful ones.

I sent this off-list, but am not ashamed to publicly make a statement re: Dr. Corbet's being a person who ``deserves to pay for support'':

Well yes, but not LaTeX support. Dr. Corbet is the first person to make me retract my statement that I wouldn't wish Microsoft Word on even an enemy --- I do now wish that he'd give up on LaTeX and switch to Microsoft Word --- he's the only person I know of that deserves that sort of misery.

And I regret having been helpful to his initial queries on this list.

Yes, it would be great except that most likely almost nobody would use it.
While w3 validators have been available for a long time, an  absolute
majority of web pages (including those made by professional web developers)
produce tens if not hundreds of errors

Yes.  So ...

For the far future one idea would be that a LaTeX document
beginning with \documenttype instead of \documentclass would
indicate the use of formally profiled LaTeX.  In that case
the latex engine could pass the document to something like a
perl script (or an internal lua script?) that executes the
processing wanted by the user, possibly workplace localized,
as indicated by a first line like

      %!my-processing-choice-designation(s),

for the particular profile.  The first stage of that
processing would always be validation against the formal
profile (commands used and relative context for command
usage).

The author's advantage in doing this is:

  * bullet-proof processing for a valid document

  * multiple end formats such as pdf, html (guaranteed
       correct), ebook (guaranteed correct), ...

  * source need not be customized for a particular journal
      since the journal can reliably process a valid
      document to suit its own purposes

Of course similar modifications could be applied to the regular
LaTeX definition.  Ordinary LaTeX shows even more clearly how the
enlargement of the arrowheads messed up macro packages.  (It also
shows the error of freezing macro definitions "for stability".)

There were many years when the pure metafont CM had the enlarged
arrows, but the bluesky outline fonts had the original shapes, so
the worst overlaps weren't generally seen until more recently.

That is a standard macro.  Or do you mean I omitted a use of it?

Good to know.

An elegant solution to this problem is to use the esvect package,
which provides a variety of arrowheads with extensible tails and at
a suitable vertical level.

I did.  I guess my browser changed m at th into m at th. Or was it

It is indeed the web site. Is this appropriate for a TeX-oriented
mail list? If you ask for plain text, you should be displaying plain
text.

Not your browser.  It is a standard feature of mailman as a trivial
antispam measure.  Even though it is trivial, there are still plenty of
totally stupid harvesters out there, so I don't think it would be an
overall win to turn it off.  We TeX-using humans can recognize what is
going on.
