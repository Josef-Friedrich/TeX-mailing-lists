Sir,

I am interested in Latex work from home.
Do you have any  work for Latex?

I can easily spend 10-15 Hrs./week

Kindly let me know.

Subject: [texhax] question about " \listoffigures"
Message-ID: <1367692700.69485.YahooMailNeo@web160503.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hi folks,

?? I use the following code for my thesis:

\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\begin{figure}
\caption{$\rho$}
\end{figure}

\listoffigures
\end{document}

But I got the error message like this:

LaTeX Font Info:    Try loading font information for U+lasy on input line 3.

("C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\tex\latex\base\ulasy.fd"
File: ulasy.fd 1998/08/17 v2.2e LaTeX symbol font definitions
)
! Missing control sequence inserted.
<inserted text> 
\inaccessible 
l.3 ...A}$, N=1000\relax }}{62}{figure.caption.17}

? 


But when I change "$\rho$" inot "$rho$", it works fine. So it seems like the "\listoffigures" cannot accept Greek 
letters in the caption.

Could someone help me with that?

Thanks a ton!

Wu

For me, that does not happen, but I have to add one additional line
before it will compile :

Do you have \documentclass {article}, or something else ?
If you have \documentclass {article}, try deleting all
auxiliary files and then trying again.

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.1305100849080.16715@snort.ams.org>

Nominations for TUG President and the Board of Directors in 2013 have
been received and validated. Because there is a single nomination for
the office of President and because there are not more nominations for
the Board of Directors than there are open seats, there is no
requirement for a ballot this election.

For President, Steve Peter was nominated. As there were no other
nominees, he is duly elected and will serve for a two-year term.

For the Board of Directors, the following individuals were nominated:
Kaja Christiansen, Steve Grathwohl, Jim Hefferon, Klaus Hoeppner,
Arthur Reutenauer, David Walden.
As there were not more nominations than open positions, all the
nominees are duly elected to a four-year term. Thanks to all for
their willingness to serve.

Terms for President and members of the Board of Directors will begin
with the Annual Meeting. Congratulations to all.

Jonathan Fine has decided to step down at the end of his term. On
behalf of the Board, I wish to thank him for his service, and for his
continued participation until the Annual Meeting.

A complete report, including the candidates' statements, is posted
on the TUG web site at

Message-ID: <AE7380CEC6213D4FABCD1F2D69DFCBE040CCC7A5@icexch-m5.ic.ac.uk>

(I tried to send this a week ago but haven't seen it, so perhaps it got lost)

Dear All,

I have a class file that uses fancyhdr and latex's leftmarks to set footers depending on the context. It's for exams, so it sets footers to "Turn to next page" or "This question continues ..." or whatever, and on the last page it's supposed to write "End of Examination". To accomplish this last task, I borrowed the logic from the lastpage package. That is, AtEndDocument I write out a label called lastpage, and in my header-building code I use an ifthenelse construction to compare \thepage with \pageref{lastpage}.

This works most of the time, but fails when there is only a small paragraph on the last page. This is due to the well-known TeX behaviour which results (see the TeX FAQ) in \thepage being "almost always wrong in the first paragraph of a page". 

I have looked briefly at the most recent lastpage package and also the documentation for pageslts, but I think both are more concerned with accessing information via labels.

There is a manual workaround by inserting a \pagebreak should this happen, but since I distribute this .cls to colleagues who are not all TeXies, I'm looking for an automated self-contained approach. And one which doesn't rely on too many external packages and such (which is why my .cls borrowed ideas from lastpage, with proper credit, rather then used the ctan package).

Anyone have any suggestions? 

Thanks
Steve

I spent some time getting my code to talk to this package, only to realise (I think) that it doesn't solve my problem. It DOES provide a robust way to find out what the number of the last page of the document is, by writing it, e.g., as a \newlabel, to the aux file. But what I need to be able to do somehow is to compare that last page number with the number of the page on which the currently-being-processed text will appear. As \thepage is unreliable, I'm stuck, or perhaps missing something obvious.

In short, the title of this thread expresses my problem. I don't want to know what the number of the lastpage is (although I appreciate that atveryend does a better job than lastpage); I want to know if I'm on it.

Thanks
Steve

There is no reliable way to find out where you are before the output
routine is run.  What you can try is to use a \label and examine the
.aux file.  \pageref is reliable, so something similar should work.

\thepage can be wrong in the first paragraph in the text *body* of a
page but it is always correct when header and footers are added to
the page (as the headers and always footers has to (and do) show the
correct page number). So if you are really using fancyhdr and do the
comparison in the footer it should work -- which means that your
code is probably faulty.

I wasn't doing the comparison inside the footer, because I use latex's pagemarks to control the instructions to be placed in the footer, e.g., "This question continues..." if I'm inside a "question environment" or "Next question overleaf". These leftmarks are therefore set by \markboth's in the \begin{question} and \end{question} commands.

Of course, the end of the examination paper is special and it is perfectly reasonably to test for this within the footer. So I have done this and fixed what you correctly describe as my "faulty" code. [At first I tried putting a \markboth command inside the footer, but I soon realised (a) that this wouldn't work and (b) it is easier just to replace the \leftmark in the footer by the actual text.]

Many thanks for the nudge in the right direction,
Steve

If you want to do the page number comparision in the body you should
use *two* \label's: one for lastpage and one for the current page
and then compare the two \pageref's.

In this case at least, doing this in the body would require serious convolutions in the code.

By comparison, doing it inside the footer itself involved adding a single line of code, and removing 15 or 20 from elsewhere that were no longer necessary. That must be ample evidence that it is the right way for me to go!

Best wishes and thanks

FYI to all ... I'm planning to halt package updates in TeX Live in a
week or so, around May 27, in order to prepare the DVD image (as usual).
(The binaries are already essentially frozen, barring bad bugs coming up.)

So, package authors, please be aware, and everyone, please give the
pretest a whirl if you feel like trying.  Info is here:
http://tug.org/texlive/pretest.html

Thanks,
Karl

Hi everyone, I need add at the final line "\\" (without quotes)

For this reason I need a variant through the regular expressions, but

Well, was very simple:

find: \n
and replace with: \\\ \n

Message-ID: <00f401ce5869$1b7eaca0$527c05e0$@t3works.com>

Hi,

 

I installed TeXLive from a DVD I purchased from TeXLive on Windows 7.

latex works fine with test.tex

xelatex, on the same test.tex, produces on the screen

 

                [1] + Done(134) xelatex test.tex

                    6648 Abort xelatex

 

xelatex.exe appears under /texlive/2012/bin/win32 and it has 3072 bytes.

 

I reinstalled everything using 

 

                http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html

 

but I obtained the same result with xelatex aborting.

 

Ideas? Thanks,

 

Tondo

Hi,

 

Apparently the culprit is not xelatex but the ksh shell I have running in
Windows 7.

xelatex seems to run OK in cmd.exe

But latex runs fine in the same shell.

 

Thanks again,

Subject: [texhax]  Black box in math mode with LuaLaTeX + koma script
Message-ID: <51A8B1BA.3050408@tuwien.ac.at>

Hi,

I just stumbled over the following peculiar problem: When typesetting
the following minimal example,


\documentclass{scrreprt}

\pagestyle{empty}

\begin{document}

\[

\sqrt{\sum_i \Bigg(}

\]

\end{document}


with LuaLaTeX, the square root symbol is typeset above the rest of the
math, with a large black box inside. This is reproducible with all koma
script documentclasses. When switching to "article", using pdfLaTeX, or
replacing \Bigg( by something smaller, the formula is typeset as it
should be.

Can someone reproduce this / tell me what the problem is / tell me how
to fix this?

Regards,
Stefan

This code runs fine for me as it is using lualatex (the TeXLive 2010 version,
two years older than your version).  Are there any complaints about fonts in
your log?  (I'm seeing 3 size substitutions with cmex10.)

Reproduced. Let's continue this on the luatex list.
