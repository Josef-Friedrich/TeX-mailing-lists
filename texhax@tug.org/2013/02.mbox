I know, this intersects w/ the world of fantasy and Dr. Knuth's San Francisco presentation, but it's where I'm at.

I'd like to find a way to preview CNC projects w/in TeX environments. The easiest way would be if there was a gcode2pdf converter --- I did find gcode2eps:

http://code.google.com/p/gcode2eps/

but that will involve converting the eps to display somehow (I really miss my NeXT Cube and Display PostScript). I'm also not having any luck getting that compiled....

Another option would be converting Asymptote or METAPOST to g-code. There are options for this, but AFAICT, all of them ``cheat'' by creating a polyline instead of approximating a B?zier curve as arcs (I'd love to be wrong on this).

If there're any other CNC mill users who use TeX who would like to compare notes, I'd be glad of it.

  http://gerbv.geda-project.org/

supports Gerber RS-274X files, Excellon drill files, but not the older
RS-274D standard.  I'm using Gerbv only as a preview tool, but it can
also export to PDF and PostScript.

All these old file formats assume pen plotters and approximate arcs by
polylines.  But what's even worse is how solid polygones are
described.  The thinner the pen, the larger the file.

Hi,

Can someone in the user group to let me know if we can still use the ftp to download tex pkg from tug.ctan.org? I was able to use the ftp program up until last year, but it stopped recently...

Does anyone know the new ftp address?

The tug.ctan.org host got moved, but you really shouldn't be choosing an
explicit mirror in any case. The recommended way to access CTAN is to
use mirror.ctan.org. That said, for me

  ftp mirror.ctan.org

connects to DANTE's core server.

I do not know about ftp. http://tug.ctan.org is available for me 
right now. In January, tug.ctan.org became a CTAN mirror in the 
sense of a TeX archive with the same directory structure like 
mirror.ctan.org, so for instance there is tug.ctan.org/macros/. 
At least some days in December (and maybe many months before), 
tug.ctan.org worked like www.ctan.org, providing package 
descriptions under tug.ctan.org/pkg and a TeX archive under 
tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/. tug.ctan.org/pkg doesn't work now, 
while tug.ctan.org/tex-archive now works like tug.ctan.org 
(less pretty than tug.ctan.org/tex-archive in December).

I respectfully beg to strongly differ.

You are thinking about the limitations of the currently available
tools.

We are thinking about smooth and flexible workflows.

We want a design where we edit LaTeX code in our favorate editor (not
some poor inflexible design imposed upon us by a graphical user
interface).  We then want the automatic conversion to a PDF.  I use
atchange to do this so that I just type a ',' while in vim and the
file gets written out and the conversion happens automagically.  When
I'm at work, I want a PDF displayer to notice that the file was
written and to display the changes without altering the current view
in any other way.

When I'm at home, I ssh to work and my showpdf script realizes that
and sends the PDF to me from work.  I want the PDF displayer at home
to update the PDF.

This works 99.9% of the time without crashes.  The result is that
either at work or at home (or anywhere!!) I have one window I edit in
without using the mouse.  In another window the resulting PDF is
displayed whenever I want.

This is a WIWIWIG "what I want is what I get" system.

I chose to work with Skim because it handles this beautifully most of
the time.  I could not even get a response from Adobe to implement an
automatic update feature.  There is clearly a need for this mode.  For
those using this mode we do NOT CARE ABOUT MARKING OUR PDF.  EVER. 
(We do that separately.  We are responsible if we write marks and they
are overwritten.)

If there were a way to tell Skim to update the PDF from the unix
command line then the rare crashes presumably would be eliminated. 
(These crashes involve the silly spinning ball and so take precious
time so a way to avoid them, though rare, would be nice.)

1) http://mirror.ctan.org redirects to a "nearby" mirror.
ftp://mirror.ctan.org does not, because the FTP protocol doesn't support
redirection.  Therefore ftp://mirror.ctan.org will always end up at
(currently) the dante site.  So don't do that.


2) http://tug.ctan.org and ftp://tug.ctan.org now go to the University
of Utah, thanks to Nelson Beebe.  Announcement:
https://lists.dante.de/pipermail/ctan-ann/2013-January/006778.html

Ping not working proves nothing; ICMP can be and often is filtered even
when ftp/http/rsync/whatever is allowed through.

ftp://tug.ctan.org works for me right now.  Overload is always possible;
more likely with ftp than any other protocol.  Active/passive ftp is
another likely culprit.


3) http://ctan.tug.org, on the other hand, is the same as
http://mirror.ctan.org.  (And so, as with #1, ftp://ctan.tug.org/
shouldn't be used.)


4) DNS is public information.  So when in doubt, you can always do DNS
queries to see exactly what is intended to go where.


Hope this helps, though I fear it won't.

I installed MikTeX last year, and usually it worked out ok.  But today I

I uninstalled the MikTeX from my computer, and re-installed the new MikTeX

I used to have PCtex on my old Thinkpad, but it died last year.  After I

I really appreciate if someone can help me to solve this problem.

I had a problem with MiKTeX and TeXStudio a while back that required a
complete R&R of the programs. If you could supply me with a bit more
info; ie, OS version, and how you removed the programs, I might be able
to afford you some assistance.

Subject: [texhax] The details of \csname, in this specific case
Message-ID: <CAO5s+KRmV2TEsa7Eeq-TE3ERCZ6xQeMvUeyoe1VJBOud-UCwuQ@mail.gmail.com>

So, I found a nifty little hack online, and I adapted it such that I
can type my TeX sources in UTF8 and have macrons come out correctly.
The code is pasted toward the bottom of this message.

Before I get to my question, I should first stem a few obvious
comments: Yes, I know XeTeX exists. But, I really like xdvi. For some
reason xdvi finds XeTeX's dvi output unworkable, and so I'm sticking
with straight up TeX, so I can keep using xdvi.

Now, onto my actual questions. The below TeX code works, but I don't
exactly know how. I understand what the \catcode is doing, and I
understand \expandafter is doing. Naturally, I'm also very familiar
with how UTF-8 internals work, with variable length sequences and all
that good stuff. What I don't quite understand is what is inside of
the \csname.

1) I would have expected to have to encode c4 and c5 as something like
`^^c4 and `^^c5 inside of the \csname, but somehow that is not
required.

2) I thought that \csname took only "character tokens," but wouldn't
something like "c4" be two separate character tokens, first "c" and
then "4"?

3) Moreover, what is that colon doing in between the c4 and the #1?

4) How exactly does TeX come to interpret the #1 as a "character
token," aren't things above value 127 by default labeled "invalid?"

5) And finally, why exactly is the single quote needed before the ^^c4
for the \catcode, but not in the \def?

I've tried to scour the TeXbook for these answers, but I've come up
short handed.

=== [ BEGIN PASTE ] ===
\catcode`\^^c4=13

I think this means that you will be limited to using UTF-8 for only those 
Unicode code points in the range 128--255, because standard TeX's 
internals manipulate indivisible characters only as 8-bit quantities.

Correct.

>3) Moreover, what is that colon doing in between the c4 and the #1?

See below.  It's minimizing the risk of macro name conflict, and making 
things a bit easier to read.

>4) How exactly does TeX come to interpret the #1 as a "character
>token," aren't things above value 127 by default labeled "invalid?"

I think only ASCII 127 (DEL) is labeled invalid.  Post-7-bit-TeX, bytes 
above 127 in the input stream are usually classified as "other" 
characters (as opposed to letters), so that they pass on through to being 
placed in the layout one at a time without affecting the interpreter's 
execution context.

>5) And finally, why exactly is the single quote needed before the ^^c4
>for the \catcode, but not in the \def?

The \catcode primitive sees the reverse apostrophe ` and then looks ahead 
without expanding for a single byte representing a character in the range 
0-255.  But if it finds a macro whose name is exactly 1 character long 
(in which case it doesn't have to be a letter character), it uses that 
macro name's single character (after the backslash) as the byte it was 
looking for.  (This likely implicitly enters the macro name into the 
internal dictionary if it was not there before, and leaves it alone if it 
was already there, but that's an internal detail not really relevant).  
It's not clear why a 1-character macro name rather than just the byte is 
being used here.  Perhaps it's a TeX idiom to avoid problems if the ^^c4 
character is already active.

So, after all that rigmarole, the redefinition of the character bytes 
^^c4 and ^^c5 to being active characters (13) occurs successfully.  The 
purpose is so that some other macro can be fired the moment the scanner 
encounters one of these two bytes (a ^^c4 or a ^^c5) on the input.  Those 
two active-character-bound macro definitions follow.  They are only 
temporary macros in the service of defining a bunch of other macros.

What TeX does when the ^^c4 byte is encountered in the input is (a) it 
collects two arguments following.  The first argument #1 is expected to 
be a single byte that is the second byte of the two-byte UTF-8 sequence 
(TeX just sees it as another input character likely of type "other").  
The second argument #2 is collected as a brace-enclosed set of tokens (or 
it could be another single byte character, but the usage below is the 
former case).

When the macro representing active character ^^c4 is executed, it itself 
defines a new macro.  But that new macro's 4-character name is 
non-standard (it has non-letters in it, including a colon).  The four 
characters are all the bytes between \csname and \endcsname, but treated 
as if they were letters to form the entire name.  So if argument #1 were 
matched to character Z, the new macro's name would be "c4:Z" (without 
quotes, and eliding the backslash).  Typically, though, argument #1 will 
be a legal second/final UTF-8 byte.

The new macro so defined when ^^c4's active character macro is fired 
takes no arguments.  But it is followed by brace-enclosed substitution 
body, which is filled in with whatever was collected into #2 in the 
original active character macro being executed to define the new macro 
with the weird name.

After these definitions are the invocations of various macros that when 
executed, leave a macro-mapping between pairs of UTF-8 bytes encountered 
sequentially on the input and individual TeX glyphs/character or names of 
character-codes (like \i).

Then, after those special mapping definitions are made and executed, the 
two active character macros are redefined to simply invoke the various 
mapping macros previously defined, without causing a redefinition of 
anything.  The scanner never sees any macro names with colons in them, it 
only sees active characters mapped to predefined macros with weird names, 
and calls them to substitute the final macron characters.

It's all a clever, egregious hack, of course, but it works for 2-byte 
UTF-8 sequences, or at least a subset of them.

Anyway, that's what I can glean from your quoted code; I've not used it 
myself.

Subject: [texhax] Width of rules using the semantic package
Message-ID: <E1U9zuf-0007kN-0a@smtp1.cc.ic.ac.uk>

Hi,

I'm using the semantic package to typeset some computation trees. The rules
are extending too far, unfortunately, and I can see nothing in the
documenation that would allow me to correct this. I suspect this explanation
isn't very clear, so I'm including some code here:

+++

\usepackage{semantic}

\[
\inference
{(([d(0,5)].[d(3,5)]).[d(3,1),i(3,y)]).([d(0,5)].[d(0,1)]).[d(3,5),i(3,our)]
}
{
\inference
{[d(0,3)].[i(3,y)].[].[d(3,5),i(3,our)]}
{
\inference
{[d(0,3)].[i(3,y)].[d(3,5),i(3,our)]}
{
\inference
{
[d(0,3)].([i(3,y)].[d(3,5)]+([d(3,5).[i(3,y)])).[i(3,our)]
}
{
}
}
}
}
\]

+++

I wonder whether the sematic package will ever do the job. The only solution
I can think of is not to use nesting but to lay the rules out one under the
other in a table although I'm sure this will create other problems.

It's good to be back on the texhax mailing list. I used to be on here
several years ago when writing my second book and it was kind of a life
saver!

Kind regards,

James

Doug is essentially correct, I am just trying 
a different way to explain that.

Doug did not answer this, and it is difficult for me too ... 
"encoding c4" may be too much of a metaphor, the matter should be 
addressed more directly.

The \csname construct indeed gets two character tokens from input "c4" 
as well as from input "c5".

Doug named the same two reasons that came to my mind.

I guess the same, and I had to care for this in the fifinddo package 
by a loop turning the character codes into "other". 
Your code may work due to earlier context that does the same. 
I have seen such a loop in the graphics package. From a glance at 
inputenc.sty (LaTeX) I guess that it turns them into "active" 
instead.

I cannot find an answer in The TeXbook quickly about TeX's 
(INITEX's) default (would require reading many pages). 
AFAIK The TeXbook originally was written 
when TeX took 7-bit characters. I would not be surprised 
if the default were left to the installation.
After what I have experienced and seen, I would say that 
it is safe (at least) to "fix" those catcodes before 
trying your code.

> 5) And finally, why exactly is the single quote needed before the ^^c4
> for the \catcode, but not in the \def?

The \catcode "function" or "command" here takes two arguments, 
the first one is a character code. The backquote is a means to 
get that character code from an ensuing token whose name string 
consists of a single character, by taking the latter's character 
code.

There would have been other ways ...

=== [ BEGIN PASTE ] === 
> \catcode`\^^c4=13
> \catcode`\^^c5=13

    \catcode"C4=13 \catcode"C5=13

is a little more straightforward with the same effect 
(provided the double quote has not been made unusual before, 
 as with german.sty).

TeX perceives each of your "?" etc. characters with macron 
as two character tokens. Call them [X] and [Y]. 
[X] has hex code either C4 or C5. The above code renders 
the character code associated with [X] active for the sequel.

(With heavier typographical means at hand, I would use a 
 different notation.)

> \def^^c4#1#2{\expandafter\def\csname c4:#1\endcsname{#2}}
> \def^^c5#1#2{\expandafter\def\csname c5:#1\endcsname{#2}}

    \def^^c4#1{\expandafter\def\csname c4:#1\endcsname}

should have done, anyway, ...

After these two definitions, [X] is a macro that turns its 
first argument into a macro definition. If [X] has hex 
character code C4, the macro that will be defined has a name 
consisting of the three characters `c', `4', `:', and (as 
fourth) the character associated with the character token 
following [X] when [X] acts as a macro.

I.e., if [X] (having hex character code C4) finds [Y] 
that is the character token formed from the character [Z] 
(assuming [Z] was not a "funny space"), the name of the 
macro that [X] will define will be "c4:[Z]".

[Z] is assumed to be unique for [Y] here, so there is
a mapping from pairs ([X],[Y]) of character tokens to 
"control sequence tokens" [X|Y] such that [X|Y] is a 
token with name "c4:[Z]" above.

This choice of the macro name is quite arbitrary, 
but an intelligible choice.

Actually your idea to use the backquote in the macro name 
reminds me of the situation that [Y] might be an 
active character token, then 

    \def^^c4#1#2{\expandafter\def\csname c4:\string#1\endcsname{#2}}
    \def^^c5#1#2{\expandafter\def\csname c5:\string#1\endcsname{#2}}

would be safer.

`c4' and `c5' in the macro names are very arbitrary, 

    \def^^c4#1#2{\expandafter\def\csname AXXXX\string#1\endcsname{#2}} 
    \def^^c5#1#2{\expandafter\def\csname AXXXXX\string#1\endcsname{#2}}

would have done as well, but may render debugging more difficult. 
There just must be two different 

> ?{\=a}
> ?{\=e}
> ?{\=\i}

E.g., TeX perceives the `?' starting the previous line 
as [X][Y] where [X] has hex character code C4, and [Y] has A9, see

    http://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl?number=512 

[X] defines [X|Y] (whose name is the string "c4:[Z]" where 
[Z] has hex code A9) so [X|Y] will expand to the sequence 
of the two tokens associated with \= and \i.

I generally consider the usual notation like `\=' here a reason of 
confusion. TeX typically turns the two input characters `\' and 
`=' into a "control sequence token"(?) whose name is `='. 
It is common to denote this "control sequence token" by `\=', 
but in my view this you always have to wonder whether `\=' 
is a string of two characters or a single character token. 
The TeXbook starts with the first interpretation on page 7 
and then switches to the second interpretation on page 39 
? "A control sequence is considered to be a single object 
that is no longer composed of a sequence of symbols". 
The control sequence was a sequence of symbols until there, 
and it is a kind of sarcastic joke that those non-sequences 
are now called "control sequences".

> ?{\=o}
> ?{\=u}
> ?{\=A}
> ?{\=E}
> ?{\=I}
> ?{\=O}
> ?{\=U}

Next that [X] is redefined so that the sequence "[X][Y]" 
of character tokens expands to [X|Y] which in turn expands 
to that sequence of two tokens as above, the first one for 
the macron accent.

> \def^^c4#1{\csname c4:#1\endcsname}
> \def^^c5#1{\csname c5:#1\endcsname}

With the above alternatives for defining [X], this might better be

    \def^^c4#1{\csname c4:\string#1\endcsname}
    \def^^c5#1{\csname c5:\string#1\endcsname}

or 

    \def^^c4#1{\csname AXXXX#1\endcsname}
    \def^^c5#1{\csname AXXXXX#1\endcsname}

> ??????????

TeX perceives the previous line as consisting of [X][Y] pairs. 
For `?', it sees the control sequence token whose name has 
a single character of hex character code C4, A9 for the next token. 
That pair expands to the control sequence token with name string 
"c4:[Z]" where [Z] is the character whose hex character code is A9. 
That token was referred to as [X|Y], and it expands to the two 
tokens tokenized from the string `\=\i'. The `i' case is somewhat 
special with `a' we have just `\=a', but we need the `i' variant 
without the dot.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Font installation
Message-ID: <CAO0LSb56w4Y-NCNbsyjbX8qMLDUzbK5QAtkjimTt-FPOpW8zSg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have recently upgraded to Fedora 17 and I'm having trouble
reinstalling the fonts that I need. I'm slightly embarassed that I
can't get it to work and that I never learn... I have two fonts that
I've been using in TeX for almost a decade. In other words, I've
installed them several times before and I had difficulties getting it
to work last time I upgraded my system but somehow it worked in the
end.

I guess my first question is: What is the preferred place to install
fonts in? I'm on a laptop that no one but me is using and I'm using
texlive 2007-70. I'm editing files with emacs and I'm using command
line tools to compile.

What do I need to do other than putting the files in the right place
in my texmf folder, adding the maps to updmap.cfg , running texhash
and updmap?

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Best,
/Henrik

Please, seriously consider to install vanilla TeXLive; the one from
your distribution will probably always be (hopefully) out of date.

Hm, hm. Are TeX Live's formats for "latex" and "pdflatex" made with 
that INITEX? where is the e-TeX?

Once I observed that pdfTeX in PDF mode made a spurious line 
for a blank space above an empty code line while it didn't 
in DVI mode. Therefore I am not convinced that pdfTeX resembles 
Knuth's TeX to the expected degree. (However, of course, see below.)

In March 2010 I had to assign "other" to those 8-bit characters 
with "latex" and/or "pdflatex". My piece of TeX Live then was 
from Fedora 8 and TeX Live 2006 (I think). I have made a note 
for me to check the issue another time, once in the future. 

> See also TeXbook, page 39, 4th paragraph.  

Thanks, but see above. (For others: "When INITEX begins, 
... All 256 characters are initially of category 12, except")
I had marked it by pencil, remembered that there is a 
paragraph starting with "When INITEX begins" somewhere 
in the TeXbook and tried to find it, but did not want to read 
so much from pp. 38f. yesterday. With an electronic copy, 
it would have been simple.

> BTW, the TeXbook already
> describes TeX 3, which is an 8-bit engine.

There have been TeXbooks that have described TeX 3, while 
others have not. AFAIK, \holdinginserts was new with TeX 3. 
I once compared p. 125 in my 1993 TeXbook, describing 
\holdinginserts, with p. 125 in a copy that did not describe 
\holdinginserts, and compared other pages of both copies. 
My impression was that the newer issue was by no means 
"completely revised", rather changed as little as possible. 
I had referred to that impression (on the 7-bit origin). 
I may have used a xerox copy from the old TeXbook that I 
took in a library in the early 90ies, and it may well have 
been the 1984 edition.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

"tex" is supposed to be DEKs program - he would be very unhappy otherwise.
"etex", "latex" and "pdflatex" default to pdfTeX.

Thanks, great to learn. I dared to look at the fucking TeX Live manual 
for the first time in my life, and in the history for 2004 I found:

    pdfetex is now the default engine for all formats 
    except (plain) tex itself.

I have not dared to see further whether that policy changed later.

I have dared to try Reinhard's 

    <cmd> \\showthe\\catcode222

for <cmd> from etex -ini, latex, pdflatex, ... indeed always got 12.

Right. So basically just uninstall the one I have and replace it with
vanilla? Are you saying that will make font installation work better
for me?

Then I clicked on "Extensions to TeX" in the fucking manual 
(from TeX Live 2009) -- TOC of texlive-en.pdf -- and found more.

It would help getting support. And in general it would make font
installation easier, as you could use XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX with fontspec.

What type of fonts do you have?

On my walks in progress, I have often thought about the problem 
that obviously not everybody understands all the subtleties of 
my postings, and of what I could do about it.  I consider certain 
means (strings) commonly used on the web to deal with this kind 
of problems somewhat "self-defeating".  Maybe I should paste 

    IF YOU ARE [XYZ], YOU ARE RECOMMENDED NOT TO CONTINUE 
    READING THE PRESENT POSTING.

to the top of certain postings of mine in the future.  

But [XYZ] is difficult.  Using only general terms in it 
is more subtle than, e.g., a relation to an age of 18 years 
or so.

After another hour, this idea has come to my mind:  In [XYZ], 
I could simply enumerate, name by name, the endangered person. 
What do you think?

World-wide wishes,

    Uwe.


P.S.: I suppress certain comments such as mentioning 
the great Robin Fairbairns or why Markus Kohm signed 
one copy of his manual with "RTFM" as "self-defeating".

The subtleties of what you write are irrelevant.  My complaint
was aimed solely at your use of a word that has no place in
a public forum such as this.  Omit the obscenities and the
problem will disappear.

I for one am quite happy to see "language such as that". Sometimes
"fucking" is the only appropriate adjective.

I am offended by *many* things that Philip Taylor would probably
consider to be completely acceptable.  But I overlook them, inasmuch
as I respect the right of others to express themselves as they
see fit.

If TeXhax degenerates into a forum in which such language is
tolerated, I for one will take no further part in it.  And
I doubt I will be alone in that.

This adjective is at least inappropriate when talking about the TeX
Live Guide.  The document was created by volunteers and everybody is
invited to contribute if it's not good enough.

To bring things full circle, perhaps there should be a rule that folks use

\csname c4:!^@@$#+@*!?@^&*!:c4\encsname

when the emphatic urge arises.  ^^C4 isn't just a UTF-8 starter byte, 
after all, it's a double-caret explosive!

I originally thought it is only Philip TAYLOR who lacks the feeling 
for what "fucking" means here, but now it seems that a larger 
audience could profit from a tutorial on the history of the RTFM idea 
and on making and understanding jokes in general, at the next EuroTeX
meeting.  When you pass the final exam; you will receive a humour 
certificate.  If you don't pass, Reinhard, no problem, you can rehearse 
with your private coach for a year and perhaps get it the year after!

Otherwise or before that, I may strip the jokes from my postings,
and Phil and Reinhard will only get the sober ("diet") extracts 
that they can digest.

Or the community may hold a vote to replace `RTFM' (as it doesn't  
meet certain ethical standards considered more important than in 
the past millenium, "politically incorrect" meanwhile) by something
like `RTGMWAWP4TED' -- "Read The Glorious Manual Whose Authors We 
Praise 4 Times Each Day". The Wikipedia article

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM

then should be rewritten accordingly.

Cheers,

    Uwe.

I suspect that Philip' knowledge of English expletives is far more
extensive and detailed than Uwe's. Uwe reminds me a young boy who just has
learned his first F-word and repeats it in every sentence; however when he
grows up he would reserve the usage of this and similar words to situations
where it is really appropriate or even necessary :D

re "rtfm", yes, there are times when one
finds that "frustrating" or "ferschluggene"
or stronger is appropriate.  but in this
case, there are two reasons to avoid the
explicit term used, even in jest.  reinhard
has already pointed out one of them (thanks!).

the other is more pragmatic: there are a
number of "nanny filters" that will exclude
a message with certain words from delivery,
and it would be unfortunate to fail in the
effort to communicate useful information
to anyone who might learn from it.

if it's desired to vent one's frustration,
the suggested ^^c4 "workaround" sounds good
to me.

Imho nothing. (Assuming that such an old texlive already used updmap
- something I simply doesn't know).

Which suggests that you did something wrong when making this steps.

There is no need to manually mess with updmap.cfg any more

just make sure kpsewhich can find your map file, and then run
(depending on your system, as root)

updmap-sys --enable Map=myfonts.map

In the latest TL updmap has been rewritten to run a LOT faster than the earlier versions.

Yes, and most people further up the thread suggested he installed a newer one. After which Henrik asked if a newer one would make font installation easier.

That I'm doing something wrong is obvious...

updmap-sys --enable Map=font.map

works fine on my system too. However, it complains it can't find the
map which lives in
/usr/share/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/psfonts/agaramond.map. This is the
reason I asked about the preferred location. But I should prabably
begin by upgrading texlive and do it from the beginning again. It has
worked before...

Don't install the file in /usr/share - that is solely under control of
the package manager of your OS. Install it in texmf-local or your own
texmf (see the link I posted).

Yes I know that is the recommendation but I've always only have gotten
it to work if I installed system wide. I would love to find that it
works installing in texmf-local since that would solve a lot of my
issues.

Here's what I'll do: I will reinstall the latest texlive and then
follow the instructions. If it still doesn't work I will post again.
Thanks for all the input!

Yes, but with an older version of updmap you can at least do:

  updmap-sys --nohash --nomkmap --enable Map=font1.map
  updmap-sys --nohash --nomkmap --enable Map=font2.map
  ....

and finally run updmap-sys without any arguments.

The two additional arguments prevent updmap from creating the final
map files and updating the ls-R files whenever you add something to
the config file.  Without these options, adding new map files would
be quite annoying.

BTW, the version of updmap we currently have in TeX Live was not
rewritten from scratch.  Since teTeX aimed to be a TeX system for
Unix, all support programs were provided as shell scripts.  Fabrice
Popineau then ported teTeX to Windows (fpTeX).  Because shell scripts
don't run on Windows, he had to port them to C or Perl.

A few years ago I was annoyed because the Unix version of updmap is so
slow.  The reason is that shell scripts call a lot of other programs
in order to do their work and creating sub-processes and moving data
around is quite expensive.  Thus I adapted the Perl script written by
Fabrice to make it work on all platforms supported by TeX Live.  It's
30 times faster than the shell script.  It was also a good opportunity
to provide a log file which allows to determine the origin of a
particular entry in the final map file, something I really missed in
the past.

Norbert recently added support for Japanese and multiple config files.
I'm sure that it was very helpful to have only one program which runs
on all platforms.  Nevertheless, it's Fabrice who deserves credits in
the first place.

For the record, the very first release of TeX Live was based on teTeX
and thus supported Unix systems only.  The second release already
supported Windows too, providing the Windows binaries from fpTeX,
compiled by Fabrice.


Ulrike,
updmap is as old as teTeX.  The first version did not have the
--enable option and users had to edit the config file manually.
A later version introduced the --enable option, but this happened
more than a decade ago.  Unfortunately I currently don't have anything
older than TeX Live 2003 installed, but I can at least confirm that
the commands described above were supported ten years ago already.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <8738wgsmwk.wl%neal@walfield.org>

Hi,

I'm writing a macro that compares the value of a parameter.  I'm
currently using \ifx to do this as follows:

  \documentclass{article}
  
  \def\dosomething#1{
    \def\empty{}
    \def\arg{#1}
    \ifx\empty\arg
      empty
    \else
      not empty
    \fi}
  
  \begin{document}
  
  1: \dosomething{}
  
  2: \dosomething{1}
  
  \edef\foo{\dosomething{}}
  3: \foo
  
  \end{document}

This breaks if the caller uses \edef: \empty is expanded.  However, if
I protect \empty and \arg with a \noexpand, then bare uses (such as 1
and 2 in my above example) don't work:

  ! Use of \noexpand doesn't match its definition.
  \dosomething #1-> \def \noexpand \empty 
                                        {} \def \noexpand \arg {#1}
					\ifx \em...
  l.18 \edef\foo{\dosomething{}

What is the "right way" to compare argument values such that the macro
can (but need not) be used in an \edef context?

Thanks,

Neal

I wasn't aware of etoolbox, thanks for pointing it out!  Nevertheless,
I'd still like to better understand the issue.

Thanks,

e-TeX's (usually enabled in latex) \detokenize helps:

\newcommand{\dosomething}[1]{%
   \ifx\expandafter\relax\detokenize{#1}\relax
     empty
   \else
     not empty
   \fi
}

I spent some time reading and found a good solution for determining
whether an argument is empty in David Solomon's Advanced TeXbook:

  \ifx\empty#1\empty empty \else not empty\fi

Nice trick!  TeX requires a lot of lateral thinking.

You are very right: I have (sometimes) tried to find documentation 
of how to *use* TeX Live, but somehow I couldn't. What I find is 
rather about how installation works. I have not needed such information 
for getting results that I have been happy with. I have tried 
"pdflatex", "latex", and "tex", fine, but why? 
(I need not know urgently.)

Can YOU tell me? Does "the" manual contain something about 
"using" TeX Live, or is there a different manual on *using* TeX Live?
(Two possible interpretations of your hint.)

Thanks,

    Uwe.

Uwe, don't be silly.

TeX Live is a TeX distribution and the manual describes in detail
everything one has to know in order to install and use this
distribution.

However, if you don't know how to use pdflatex, latex, or tex, consult

  http://tug.org/begin.html

The TeX Live Guide already has a link to this URL on page 3.  What are
you missing?

  Reinhard
