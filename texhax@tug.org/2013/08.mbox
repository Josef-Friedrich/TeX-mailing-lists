Subject: [texhax] Placing data in margin
Message-ID: <20130803075641.6fb1402f@scorpio>

This is probably a simple problem; however, I cannot find a solution.

Using "report" class, one sided, with standard 8-1/2 x 11 paper and all
margins set to 1 inch, I am creating several forms for a local
municipality. They would take the general form of:

1. Enter Name: _____
2: Enter Address _____
3: City _____ State _____ Zip _____
4: Owner's Name: _____
5: Processed By: _____ Date: _____ Fee Paid: _____

Actually, these  forms can be several pages long and quite involved.

The problem is that they want the item number, be it a number or
letter, to be located in the margin on the left side of the form. I
cannot figure out how to accomplish that. I did try the "marginnote"
package; however, no matter how I tried, I could never get it to place
a margin item anywhere but the right side of the page.

Also, I was using "tabbing" to get the items where I wanted them, since
some lines request several bits of information. This works fine except
that the horizontal space left between the "end tabbing" and the next
"begin tabbing" is greater than the normal horizontal line spacing. Is
there anyway to automatically eliminate that problem? I have been using
negative "vspace" entries. The document(s) are usually enclosed in a
"\begin{spacing}{1.4} .... \end{spacing}" block. I loaded the
"setspace" package to accomplish that. That line spacing seems about
right for hand filled in documents.

Are the item numbers explicit (i.e., tagged) or implicit (e.g.,
generated by a \itemize environment or whatever) ?  If explicit,
try wrapping in :

	\leavevmode \llap {\hbox to <whatever> {\itemnumber \hfil}}

If implicit, you will need to read the documentation and/or code
for whatever generates them.

The item numbers are entered by me, not generated by enumerate or any
other such environment.

OK, then try wrapping them in the \leavevmode \llap {}
construct as suggested.

You probably can use pstricks to do this.  The \rput{} command will
place text relative to the current location without changing the
current location, perfect for what you want.
Then:

   \rput[tl](8.7,5.0){%
    \scalebox{0.8}{%
%\fbox{%
     \parbox[t][3.0cm][t]{3.0cm}{% \parbox[c][\height][t]{\width}%
      % T. D. Schneider and R. M. Stephens, Sequence Logos: A New Way
      % to Display Consensus Sequences Nucl. Acids Res. 18: 6097-6100,
      % 1990.
      \textbf{Schneider} \& \\ Stephens \\
      \emph{Nucl. Acids Res.} \\
      \textbf{18}: 6097-6100 \\
      1990
     }%
%}% fbox
    }%
   }%

This is actually a chunk of code from one of my powerdot slides!

* The rput locates the top left corner of the objecdt.
* It is then scaled to 80% size.
* Then I had an optional (inside the comment) fbox to draw a box
  around the text.  Remove both comments to use the fbox.
* Inside that is a parbox with the text.

Voila!

What's wrong with Phil's suggestion?  It doesn't depend on external
programs.  Your suggestion depends on PostScript for no apparent
reason.

The package is part of the standard LaTeX distribution, so it doesn't
require installation.  pstricks has some other properties - one could
draw a circle around the text, for example, that make it more
powerful.  I suppose if one wanted to avoid PostScript to be able to
use pdflatex, then it would not be a solution.

By the way, why does pdflatex prevent one from reading in postscript?

My apologies if I am being stupid and missing the essential point, but 
why doesn't \marginpar from base LaTeX accomplish what you want?  Note
that issuing the command \reversemarginpar (e.g. in the preamble) causes 
the marginalia to be placed on the left.

That doesn't sound right. A margin note can be placed on
either side.  I can't guess if you tried the right things.
(\makeatletter)
\@mparswitchfalse % all on the right
\reversemarginpar % reverse right->left

Anyway, marginpars aren't the best solution.

Rather than Phil's solution, I'd suggest using the LaTeX
commands in a LaTeX document:

\makebox[0pt][r]{4: }%

Why not use a single tabbing environment?  Are some of the items
multiline with paragraph-style line breaks?

Look at tabto.sty for a different take on tabbing.

Yuck!  Set the parameter(s) for tabbing spacing to zero.
Maybe it is just \setlength{\topsep}{0pt} but maybe also
\parsep.

I do not use LaTeX, far preferring the freedom and flexibility
of (Plain) TeX, but one book must leap out from the crowd :

	The LaTeX Companion, 2nd edition (TTCT series)
Frank Mittelbach, Michel Goossens, Johannes Braams, David Carlisle,
Chris Rowley

By the authors of LaTeX2e and numerous adjunct packages, there
can surely be no more definitive work.

    a good book or two that can give me good practical
    knowledge of how things work.

For that specific purpose, I can suggest Learning LaTeX.  It is a short,
example-based book.
http://www.ec-securehost.com/SIAM/ot55.html
(Here's a review: http://tug.org/books/reviews/tb107reviews-learnltx.html)

For a longer book, many people like A Guide to LaTeX2e, by Kopka & Daly.

The LaTeX Companion, already mentioned, is longer still, 
with many more details.

For links to these and a lot more books, both printed and online, see
http://tug.org/begin.html#doc and its references.

Best,
Karl

I wonder why no-one has mentioned Leslie Lamport's book, "LaTeX: A 
Document Preparation System"?  After all, this is getting LaTeX from the 
horse's mouth, as it were.  As far as I am concerned, no home should be 
without one. :-)

Message-ID: <5209874e.84520f0a.10de.ffffb924@mx.google.com>

hi folks,
This is the resumption of an old thread which was temporarily solved 
several months ago. I've pasted the original query and anser below.

can the list suggest a way of measuring the height and width of an 
individual row or column or any construct entirely or in part with 
the \showthe command?
I suppose what I'm looking for is a generic syntax that could be 
applied to any part of the document.
As I am not able to, as it were, eyeball the output or measure it in 
any visual way, this could be an equally efective solution.

Sincerely,
Paul

Paul,

if you say

\setbox0=\vbox{
{\hsize = 5cm \settabs 3 \columns
  \+column 1&column 2&column 3\cr
  \+one&cattle&herd\cr
  \+two&fish&school\cr
  \+three&lions&pride\cr}
}

\showthe\ht0


\showthe\dp0


you will get the height and depth of that construct.

This doesn't draw a vertical line for measuring, but if that was an
indirect method anyway, you might like this better.

If you really want a rule drawn, try this:

\setbox0=\vbox{
{\hsize = 5cm \settabs 3 \columns
  \+column 1&column 2&column 3\cr
  \+one&cattle&herd\cr
  \+two&fish&school\cr
  \+three&lions&pride\cr}
}
\hbox{\vrule  height \ht0 depth \dp0 \box0}

Dear TeX users,

As we approach mid-August, it's time for another newsletter from TUG
headquarters.

Here in New Jersey, it seems as if most of the state has headed to the
shore for vacation, but in Tokyo, the local organizing committee for the
annual meeting is hard at work creating an outstanding schedule of
talks, excursions, and gatherings that should prove highly
educational. The meeting is October 23--26 at the University of Tokyo,
Komaba, Tokyo. For full details, check out the website at
http://www.tug.org/tug2013/

The venues for 2014, 2015, and 2016 are beginning to firm up.
Check this space for more in the coming months.


Other news:

* For those in the US Pacific northwest, there's another introductory
   type design workshop from CraftingType in Seattle, Sept. 19-21.
   http://craftingtype.com/

* Also this fall is the 7th ConTeXt Meeting and TeXperience 2013
   (the annual CSTUG meeting), Brejlov, Czech Republic, Sept. 23-29.

* TUGboat 34:2 is now at the printer.  Look for your issue soon.
   The deadline for the next issue is November 8; this will be the
   conference proceedings.  In addition, articles, notes, and musings on
   any topic related to TeX and friends are welcome.

Dear all,

I have not yet been able to resolve this issue. I'm trying to install two
adobe fonts that I have used with TeX before (AGaramond and Frutiger). This
time it is not working at all. I have put all the font files in my
TEXMFLOCAL directory but I can't add the map files. The output of
updmap-sys is:

$ updmap-sys --enable Map=agaramond.map
[sudo] password for henrikfr:
updmap is using the following updmap.cfg files (in precedence order):
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg
updmap is using the following updmap.cfg file for writing changes:
  /usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg unchanged.  Map files
not recreated.
updmap: Updating ls-R files.

As you can see the texmf-local directory is not included here which makes
me think there is something wrong with the environment variables. This is
what I have currently:

$ kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL
/usr/local/texlive/2012/../texmf-local
$ kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
]$ kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFVAR
/home/henrikfr/.texlive2012/texmf-var

Any suggestions?

/Henrik

exactly where are those map files? Is it in the appropriate TDS structure?

I usually do a

kpsewhich file.map

to verify that it is found before I run updmap-sys

Howdy,

What is the path to the font.map file as reported by kpsewhich: i.e., what does

kpsewhich font.map

return?

What are you using for `map' in

updmap-sys --enable Map=map

command? Who owns your TeX distribution? If it's owned by root you need to use `sudo' before the command.

Finally, did you ever run updmap rather than updmaap-sys? If so you have a map file in your personal texmf-var (TEXMFVAR as opposed to TEXMFHOME) which is overriding the system one.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Thanks for your replies. Yes, I've run mktexlsr. The map files are here:

$ kpsewhich frutiger.map
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/map/dvips/psnfss/frutiger.map
$ kpsewhich agaramond.map
/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/map/dvips/psnfss/agaramond.map

Best,

Hi,

The structure in the example works fine, but only if there
is nor a dot neither a space in the string (dot: output is
interrupted, space: will be ignored).

What do I have to change to set also dot and spaces correctly?

TIA

Subject: [texhax] Vertical alignment in cells using "tabu"
Message-ID: <20130816071634.09bf20d5@scorpio>

I am using the "tabu" package to create a form. The form has cells
labeled: Name:, Address:, City, etcetera. It is a typical form you
would fill out for a permit. Actually, it is a Zoning Permit, but that
is not important.

I have no problem creating the document; however, I want the data that
I am entering in the cells to be top left aligned. I can not find out
how to do that without having to resort to using the "\raisebox"
command, which I also apparently seem to have to enter into each
individual cell. I have used the "\arraystretch" command to double the
vertical size of the cells.

I would assume I am doing something incredibly stupid, but I just
cannot figure out what.

Dear Madam/Sir,

when searching for "boje" in yum (Linux rpm database) there goes
texlive-multiobjective.noarch : Symbols for multibojective optimisation etc
you have a spelling mistake in the summary describing the package.

Yours faithfully,

Subject: [texhax] Place graphic on every page but first
Message-ID: <20130818155116.18fe11f0@scorpio>

I am using the "textpos" package to position an image at a specific
location on every page but the first one in a document I am working on.
Specifically, the image is placed in the heading. The "fancyhdr"
package does not place the image high enough in the heading. The
"fancyhdr" package also incorrectly places the text in the other header
fields when I use it to place an image in the header.

This is how I am using it at present:

\begin{textblock*}{30pt}[0,0](0.0in,-0.9in)
\includegraphics[scale=0.10]{../img/logo_1200x1200}
\end{textblock*}

Using it this way works fine, except, I need to place it on every page
but the first. I cannot figure out how to do that without entering
manual page breaks and then entering the code. The is a lot of work in
a 63 page document. Especially, when the page break locations are
subject to change.

I am trying to find a package that will allow me do that, but have
not found one as yet.

An alternative approach is to put the graphic inside a box or environment of some kind and then use that environment's positioning commands to place the image, e.g. here's one I use with fancyhdr:

\lfoot{\begin{tabular}{l} \\[1.0em] \includegraphics[height=0.8cm]{imperial-logo-cropped}\end{tabular}}

which pushes the image down by a linespace plus 1em. Putting it in a parbox and specifying positional alignment, adding some (positive or negative) \vspace, or some other construct may also help the positioning. Also, as an alternative to fancyhdr, you could construct your own header. For example (untested but based on some working bits),

\def\@oddhead{%
  \begin{tabular}{@{}p{0.4\textwidth}@{}p{0.2\textwidth}@{}p{0.4\textwidth}@{}}% 3 fields
    \parbox[b]{0.4\textwidth}{\flushleft Left bit} \\
    \parbox[b]{0.2\textwidth}{Page=\thepage}\\
    \parbox[b]{0.4\textwidth}{\flushright\includegraphics[]{logo}}\\
  \end{tabular}
}
\let\@evenhead\@oddhead

You can, of course, use \leftmark or \rightmark in the above, e.g., instead of "Left bit". This approach may help you control the alignment of the different parts of the header.

You can just test the page number inside the code that builds the header, e.g. (untested)

\usepackage{ifthen}    % for access to \ifthenelse
\lfoot{\ifthenelse{\thepage=1}{}{\includegraphics[]{logo}}}

which will put nothing in the leftfoot on the first page due to the blank {} and insert your logo on all subsequent pages. 

I've used all these different ideas at one time or another, and I'm sure you can combine them to get what you want.

How about defining pagestyles? Here's some pseudo-code for you. (I do not 
usually use fancyhdr, so I would have to research the commands to define 
headings, and I'm too lazy to do so right now.)

% define the header block, including positioning of the graphics:
\newcommand{\standardheadercontents}{...}
% define the header block without the graphics:
\newcommand{\firstpageheadercontents{...}
% define pagestyles
\makeatletter  % <-- needed if not in style file
% pagestyle FirstPage:
\def\ps at FirstPage{
	\FancyHdrClearHeadCommand                %<-- replace by correct command
	\FancyHdrHead{\firstpageheadercontents}  %<-- replace by correct command
}
% pagestyle StandardPage:
\def\ps at StandardPage{
	\FancyHdrClearHeadCommand                %<-- replace by correct command
	\FancyHdrHead{\standardheadercontents}   %<-- replace by correct command
}
\makeatother   % <-- needed if not in style file

% after begin document:
% first activate fancyhdr's capabilities:
\pagestyle{fanchdr}  %<-- replace by correct command
% now use the header blocks defined above:
\pagestyle{StandardPage}
\thispagestyle{FirstPage}



Disclaimer: I took this code from a working but very old document, which I know 
was created by a person who tends to hack things together with a genius for 
making things work and no eye at all for style or ease of usage. So there 
probably exist better ways to do this...

Hope that helps anyways,

	Susan

Message-ID: <6EA0A8E4-AC26-4641-A2D7-196ECEC019C4@frycomm.com>

With luatex and xetex rushing towards maturity, I've been wondering --- could one do a minimal TeX installation oriented for the 21st century and Unicode? The Fonts directory is _huge_ and I believe switching to just OpenType would eliminate a lot of overhead.

Or am I mis-understanding, and would this sort of change need to be effected at a lower level?

It seems like this would be a good thing to do for LaTeX3 (or does it not use plain.tex? I'm subscribed to the LaTeX3 mailing list, but am a bit hazy on the details).

It should be straight-forward enough to rename plain.tex to something else and then use that --- I'm just surprised that it isn't plain.web as a source file (I seem to recall that at some point someone published a literate program version of it, interweaving it w/ the text from _The TeXbook_, but that would run afoul of the copyright / license).

A .web file is the documented source of a Pascal program.  But
plain.tex is a macro package.

tangle tex.web -> tex.p   (the Pascal source of TeX, the program)
weave  tex.web -> tex.tex (the documented source code)

You cannot use Web for TeX macro packages.  Instead you can create a
LaTeX .dtx file.  See

  texdoc doc
  texdoc docstrip

  Reinhard

Oh. I'd not realized that Web was so limited.

Interestingly, Robin pointed out:

http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb16-3/tb48bzyl.pdf

which if it isn't the literate version of plain.tex I was thinking of, is even better. One of these days, I'm going to start reading all the TUG back issues....

So at some point, I guess the questions are:

 - how much disk space / bandwidth could be saved by creating a TeX distribution which only included OpenType fonts and which used them by default
 - would such a distribution be able to pass TRIP?
 - what would be the appropriate uses for such a distribution? It seems to me it'd be well-suited to use on tablets, or in customized typesetting situations --- might even be useful as a back-end for LyX
 - would there be any other advantages of such a setup?
