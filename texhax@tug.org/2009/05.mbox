Thank you, those are helpful hints.  But still, I have a couple of
paragraphs I can't reword, and some text sticking stubbornly out into
the right margin.  Not only don't I know what to do, I can't get *any*
of the parameters I read about (\tolerance, \hyphenpenalty, etc) to
affect the offending paragraph.  Can they not be applied this way?

Thanks,

 -tom

Those settings are applied to a paragraph.  In your case, the new
settings are reverted to their original values at the end of the
group, before the paragraph ends.  So you should end the paragraph
while the new settings are still in effect:

    {\hyphenpenalty5000 Text of offending paragraph.\par}

or just

    {\hyphenpenalty5000 Text of offending paragraph.

    }

Best,
Oleg

Thanks -- but this is still not really what I'm looking for, since --
as far as I know -- minipages can not span pages? What I am looking
for is a functionality similar to the standard letter class. The
purpose is to create an exam (which spans some 15--20 pages) in
several copies with a unique code (counter) on each copy.

However, I have solved this with a little perl program that creates
multiple copies of the source TeX file, compiles them and sends them
to the printer. I found that this approach is a major advantage over a
huge PDF, since separate print jobs makes it possible to use the
automatic stapling functions of the printer. Saves a lot of work!

Anyway, thank you for all suggestions!

Put the text for the exam in a file and use a loop (e.g. \whiledo
from the ifthen package) to \input the file many times.

According to en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemets, Adobe Systems Inc. confesses 
to have initiated this mistake in the world of computer typesetting. An 
edit of April 11 has removed the speculation that it is too late to undo 
the mistake concerning compatibility, as it is so widely spreaded now.

I suspected german.sty had brought it into TeX, it has `guillemot' as part 
of control sequences. The documentation, however, says `guillemets'. 
Inspector Taylor, would you please arrest Bernd Raichle and hear him?

On the other hand, the German Wikipeda names "M?wchen" ("little seagulls") 
as a synonym in typography. I guess this is because they rather look like 
$\prec$ than like $<$, and rotating $\prec$ leftwards looks like the way of 
representing one of countless birds in the sky on simple drawings (as in 
comics).

So my impression is that the "seabirds" thing is not so wrong. Note as well 
that they are also called "G?nsef??chen" (little goose feet) in German.

Rather, the epistemology of "guillemets" according to Wikipedia has much of 
an "origin myth" in my view. It is attributed to a printer and punchcutter 
*Guillaume le B?*, 1525--1598, while the first known guillemets date from 
1527. The German Wikipedia says that according to a handbook on French 
indeed some "Guilleaume" used guillemets in 1527 (mastery giftedness often 
becomes apparent in childhood already). According to the French Wikipedia, 
that "Guillaume" florished in the 17th century. The German Wikipedia 
continues speculating that the term "guillemet" developped from something 
like "Guillaume ma?tre" or "Guillaume mett..." ... (The German article on 
Guillaume le B? instead says that "Guillaume" means "Little William".)

Cheers! ("Pr?sterchen")

     Uwe.

"spreaded" hurts, sorry.

In the upshot of the evidence I collected, the correct term is 
"guillemotets" for "little birds of a species belonging to Uria or Cepphus 
(en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemot) ...

Cheers;-)

     Uwe.

Hi,

I'm all new to LaTeX. But I'm sick of wasting my time in WYSIWYG editors
trying to get the layout "just right".

Can someone help me do something like
this<http://forums.adobe.com/message/1930823>in LaTeX? I'd have to
import an EPS for the front page. Perhaps do a couple
of tables as well.

Many thanks!

See the lshort PDF in

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/

Maybe you already have it. Try

texdoc lshort

in your terminal or Command Prompt. Also see the tutorial by TUG India:

What LaTeX will make will be much nicer than this.

These look like they might have been made with an openoffice business 
template, which can easily be installed with an add-on.

For writing business letters, I use LaTeX's "letter" class.

Hello everyone!

I just wanted to inform everyone that with the help of Peter Wilson,  
and his creation of the pwasu.sty file, I have passed my final format  
approval for my thesis!!  I would also like to thank Yuri Robbers and  
Tom Sgouros for their help with the last few formatting changes I  
needed.

If anyone is interested in using the style file for their ASU Thesis/ 
Dissertation, please contact me.  I will likely be unsubscribing to  
this list for now.

Thank you all again for your attention and your help!

Given how much stress and hard work this seems to have taken, why not
upload the style file to CTAN so others can easily find and make use of it?

Even if it's still got some rough edges, it'll be a lot easier for the
next ASU student to start from a style file that's passed the format
approval once before.

Hi All,

Good suggestion.  Robert Haener <robstafarian at verizon.net> actually  
sent me an email requesting the file so he could post it to the CTAN  
site.  Before he suggested that, I didn't know that was something I  
could do.  So I gave him the file and he will be doing this.

:)

Sorry, but what do you mean by it ``does not show the required code''?  
Every example has its code side by side!

Maybe it's something else you want?

You have a corrupted PDF (see below the same paragraph from my PDF).  
What platform (OS) do you use? What application do you use to view the

The words "guillemotleft" etc. were introduced into "german.sty" with
the first support for LaTeX2e and its "inputenc" mechanism.  In 1994/5
I simply copied the names from the LaTeX2e files when introducing the
appropriate definitions for "text symbols" used for the various double
and single quote glyphs.  Thus you have to arrest the responsible
persons of the LaTeX2e team, Alan and Frank as authors of the first
version of "inputenc" :-)

Btw. is this prehistoric TeX archaeology? ;-}

Isn't it fine when you drop \compose and replace it by \circ? 

I even would not be willing to type `\comp{f}{g}' in place of `$f \circ g$' or, in equations, `f \circ g'. Or \let\comp\circ to see "what you mean" rather than "what you get". 

I guess not the vertical placement is bad, it is choosing \scriptstyle that chooses a font size too small between normal size symbols.

There seems to be nothing wrong with the \emph{vertical} positioning of 
the \compose, but the \emph{horizontal} spacing between the operation and 
the operands not very correct, since \compose is not defined to be a 
binary operator. The modification

   \newcommand{\compose}{%
     \mathbin{\scriptstyle \circ}}

should do the trick.

Do you mean something like this

\mbox{\fiverm see $\scriptscriptstyle{|a| = \sqrt{a^2}}$, top of page  
12}

?

See "TeX for the Impatient". If you have a recent TeX distribution,

texdoc impatient

in your terminal; otherwise, download book.pdf from

That works, thanks :-)

I looked up the relevant section in the TeXbook, I didn't realize that
choices for math mode font sizes were so limited; it's basically just
\script and \scriptscript, if I understand correctly.

You have four choices: displaystyle, textstyle, scriptstyle and  
scriptscriptstyle (D, T, S and SS), as you can see in the TeXbook, p.  
140, and TeX for the Impatient, p. 198.

But, yes, for formulas you get dispalystyle and textstyle  
automatically when you use $$...$$ and $...$; on the other hand, S and  
SS for formulas you have to specify them.

Axel

I just installed GFS Porson, which is a lovely Greek typeface, but the docs

know where I can find out? No information about this on the GFS website either,
as far as I can tell.

I use plain TeX, so LaTeX package recommendations won't help.

Thanks for any help!

Yes, that is beyond the basic textstyle size.

Careful though, displaystyle and textstyle do not necessarily imply
different sizes, but different spacing. The size difference only occurs in
subformulae, e.g. inside frac{}{}.

You probably don't want to hear this, but it would all be much easier in
LaTeX: instead of fiverm you might use footnotesize or tiny and get exactly

Bernd, Phil, Yannis, Uncle Tom Cobbley ...

Please get your history right!  The ornithological heresy came from Adobe's
'official PostScript names' for these glyphs.  So go tell that to the
birds.

Team LaTeX is, as in all matters, totally guilt-free and irresponsible.

The words "guillemotleft" etc. were introduced into "german.sty" with
the first support for LaTeX2e and its "inputenc" mechanism. ?In 1994/5
I simply copied the names from the LaTeX2e files when introducing the
appropriate definitions for "text symbols" used for the various double
and single quote glyphs. ?Thus you have to arrest the responsible
persons of the LaTeX2e team, Alan and Frank as authors of the first
version of "inputenc" :-)

Btw. is this prehistoric TeX archaeology? ;-}

Greetings Peter,

I type in polytonic Greek by using the GreekKeys Unicode keymapping  
for OS X.  GreekKeys is available here: http://apagreekkeys.org/AboutGKU.html 
  ... I believe that the 2008 version also is available for Windows.

My .tex files, therefore, are in Unicode (UTF-8) encoding.  I use the  
XeLaTeX engine for typesetting, in order to take advantage of the  
LaTeX extensions, but the plain-vanilla XeTeX (available at http://www.tug.org/xetex/ 
  , for OS X and with a port to Windows) should provide you with a way  
to directly process UTF-8 encoded TeX files.

As a result, my .tex files include Unicode polytonic Greek characters  
directly, which I type in using the GreekKeys keyboard configuration;  
Porson gets used as the output font, which I select using the Fontspec  
package (available only under XeTeX, alas).

I've attached a sample .tex file and the corresponding PDF output, so  
you can see how I set things up.

Cheers,
Erik Norvelle

In array package the  rows in tabular environment is always typeset from

I expect the following code to define the \mybox within the

environment seem restricted to the info environment only. How to get
around this?

ok, sorry, it must be \vcenter{\hbox{$\scriptstyle\circ$}} (now tested), or \mathbin{\vcenter{\hbox{$\scriptstyle\circ$}}} after Krishnan, or a compromise suggestion of mine: \mathinner{\vcenter{\hbox{$\scriptstyle\circ$}}.

The inside-\v... error is a matter where I need help myself. Whenever I try to understand this, I think to learn that the width of a \v... is the maximum width of what is inside, but actually the width so often is the outer \hsize. It seems that the latter happens at entering hmode. The \hbox avoids entering hmode. If you replace \hbox by \mbox, you have the same problem as before. 

I wonder about \mathbin. I would agree when the subject is a group of transformations, but it would be misleading with 

    f o g(x) = ... 

The latter could be improved to 

    (f o g)(x), 

but you may have an audience that knows mathematics as a tool for its own science only and won't understand the notation easily. 

Once I knew this matter (of style in this case), I have forgotten it. But I think sometimes it is against conventions to set binary operations as \mathbin. Somewhat obvious: 1/2, 1/3 etc. About the same with a backsla&#347;h: I think when I saw \setminus the first time, I thought it was wrong, I thought there usually is no space around the set difference backslash. Or it is more usual to typeset it as \mathinner, i.e., with \, space instead of \,\, (= \:). 

?

BTW, I'm not using GFS Porson, but rather the TrueType version of  
Porson, which includes the Greek characters in their appropriate  
ranges (0370?03FF for monotonic Greek and Coptic, 0300?036F for  
polytonic).

presumably because info adds grouping

bepahs you might want to have a look at the environ package, I use that 
to store the contentes of environments and use it later.

I am sorry to give up Rowley's sly suggestion that LaTeX is 
irresponsible, but I suppose I must. 

METAFONT challenge:  Produce a design of paired Guillemites for very 
occasional display use.  There are some good starting designs
in reliefs of monks and friars engaged in activities such as 
wood-splitting.

Subject: [texhax] using larger units to determine breaks?
Message-ID: <4A00C4C4.5000104@gmail.com>

I know that the original TeX basically works in paragraphs and outputs in
pages.

But the more (fiction) works that I typeset, the more it seems to me that a
considerable improvement -- or at least less manual intervention -- would
likely be effected if the algorithms optimized page breaks over an entire
section or chapter.

Are there any versions of *TeX that have or will at some point have the
capability to optimize breaks over larger units than does the original TeX?

  Doc

PS Maybe I'm wrong and in practice this doesn't help, but it sure seems
like it should. A lot of the tweaking I end up doing seems like it would go
away if some attempt had been made to optimize over larger units.

I hope this doesn't seem too obvious, but what I would do is deposit all of
these values in variables, and \message the variables to the log file so 
that
I could read them later on out of the log file.

In fact, that is just I do with most such variables, except for "absolutes"
such as crop dimensions and page dimensions, which go into comments at 
the head of
the file.    I am often surprised by how often my somewhat leaky memory 
needs
to pop to the top of the source file to retrieve such values.

What  command(s)  should  be  used for this purpose?  Where should I put
these command in my LaTeX source files?

Dr. Jonathan Fine has done some work along those lines, and of course  
LaTeX does have a very sophisticated algorithm for determining figure  
placement (not familiar w/ ConTeXt), but tweaking the page breaks  
pretty much falls into the last n% of effort which requires human  
intervention.

The problem is solutions tend to be intricate and inter-connected and  
I've occasionally found myself going back to the beginning of a  
chapter to make the last page work out properly.

Lessee, one has a 100,000 word novel w/ 20 chapters, so average 5,000  
words per chapter, each paragraph has on average of five sentences of  
five words each, so 200 paragraphs in a chapter, figure 50 characters  
(a bit long, but I'm trying to make the math easy) per line, and 10  
characters per word (ditto) so 1,000 lines, figure 25 lines per page,  
so 40 pages, so one has to work out how 200 paragraphs of more-or-less  
1,000 lines inter-act w/ 40 page breaks --- I'll leave it to someone  
who does combinatorial mathematics to work out how many possibilities  
there are if one-fourth the paragraphs can gain a line, one-fourth can  
lose a line, one-fourth gain _or_ lose a line and the balance are  
inflexible and unyielding and won't change their line lengths w/  
reasonable type settings.

It's probably w/in reach of modern equipment, but it won't be a fast  
typesetting run.

Subject: [texhax] Help installing pzc fonts
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0905060737180.3456@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

I use pzc fonts, largely because it is convenient to have lower case as 
well as caps (otherwise \cal would be acceptable).  My paper is being 
published in an online journal and the editor does not have pzc installed 
and is uncertain how to do it.  When I asked him what his installation was 
I got this reply:

I have the standard tex implementation on cygwin. It's a unix emulator.
so it's the unix tex distribution compiled to run on a PC.

Here, in part, is my fd file:
\DeclareFontFamily{OT1}{pzc}{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzc}{m}{it}%
      {<-> s * [1.100] pzcmi7t}{}

I assume that this is basically a 7pt font, but to enlarge by 1.4 would 
be too much.  After some experiment, I decided that magnification by 1.1 
looked good.  I have files
\MiKTeX 2.7\fonts\vf\adobe\zapfchan\pzcmi7t.vf
\MiKTeX 2.7\fonts\tfm\adobe\zapfchan\pzcmi7t.tfm
in my miktex distribution.  Can anyone tell me where these files should go 
for his cygwin distribution?

Oh yes. This is the really fun part of the production... sometimes you
are lucky and you change one little thing which makes 50 pages fall
nicely into place, other times it just doesn't work no matter what you
do.

There is of course Michael Plass' thesis on the matter "Optimal
pagination techniques for automatic typesetting systems" and also
Stefan Wohlfeil's "On the pagination of complex documents". The latter
came with a program - XFORMATTER I believe - to make the pagination
choices.

A further complication, one must keep track of which lines end in  
hyphens and whether or no the paragraph can be re-set so as to avoid a  
hyphen at the end of a given line.

Ages ago I posted my working technique for page composition --- if  
someone can suggest an improvement on it, I'd be very interested.

I'm beginning to suspect that the above statement was premature, but  
would love to be proven wrong, esp. by a working algorithm.

Message-ID: <7ac5ed450905060521w1f71b7ceia263336d05af3c53@mail.gmail.com>

I wrote some macros to enable RTL in tabular evnvironments in LATeX:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


That code just works fine but if I load array package, In array package the
columns in tabular environment is always typeset from left to right even if
you enable some bidi macros. Does any one know how can I reverse columns in
the tabular environments in array package so that columns are actually
typeset from right to left instead being typeset from left to right.

I have tried very hard for a week but came with no success. Can you please
if you can help me? Can you also if  you can look at the bidi code (the
above code) I wrote for  LaTeX tabular environments and give me some
feedbacks?

Also making each entry in a cell being RTL sounds easy like I could have

\let\origin at insert@column=\insert at column
\def\insert at column{\if at RTL\beginR\fi\origin at insert@column\if at RTL\endR\fi}

Thanks to all for the replies.

My fault for not being clearer. What I was asking was this: in an environment with
gfsporson selected, what do I need to type to get TeX to produce appropriate output?

For instance, I've discovered that you get rough breathing in such an environment by
preceding a vowel with "<" (so "<o" gives you "ho"). Trial and error has got me 90%
of what I need to know. At the moment, I'm still stumped about what I need to type to
get a circumflex... "\^" doesn't work.

In case anyone wants to know, here is what I've discovered so far:

LETTERS

 final sigma	c
 theta		j
 chi		q
 omega		v
 phi		y

DIACRITICALS

 '	acute over following letter
 `	grave over following letter
 <	rough breathing over following letter
 >	smooth breathing over following letter
 |	iota-subscript under following letter

 Combine the above for multiple diacriticals: <`|v = grave rough omega with iota-subscript


Any ideas about the circumflex?

Gotta love the beginning of the last sentence of the abstract, ``For  
certain simple badness functions, the pagination problem is NP- 
complete...''

And for complex badness functions? What's more complex than  
Nondetermininstic polynomial time?

Available as a .pdf!

http://www.pi6.fernuni-hagen.de/publ/tr234.pdf

Ironic though that there's what I'd consider a bad page break on pg. 7  
(the numbered list at the top of pg. 8 has lost its introductory  
paragraph which is at the bottom of the preceding page).

> The latter

I didn't see a place to get this program from.

For those who're curious, this is a post on this subject I made to  
comp.text.tex and later re-posted to TYPO-L:

Subject: page breaking techniques (was Re: License of TeX?)
Date: 23 Aug 2003 03:15:12 GMT

My take on this is that page breaks have to take into account an entire
chapter---if one is doing a book which opens on any page, well, I've on
occasion gone back and re-run a previous chapter to change the opener
of a chapter to tweak a figure placement early on, so ideally for such
books, one wants to consider the entire text.

Here's a description of the technique I'm using at work on my current
project:

   - style the entire chapter, setting the macros appropriately for
anything which doesn't match w/ what the author did. Fix overly wide,
or poorly hyphenated paragraphs at need.

   - flip backwards to the beginning, noting if anything is awkward - if
not, you're done (I think this has happened once for a previous project)

   - make notes on awkward pages and good pages / spreads, esp. noting
bad figure placement

   - from the beginning, adjust to get nice spreads w/ good figure
placement by strategically running spreads long / short (but only
adjusting one increment at a time, so a short spread doesn't back
a long or vice-versa), adjusting paragraph length w/ \looseness,
figure / table placement, creating figure pages at need,
space above heads and around tables and figures &c.

   - if one runs into an intractable problem, back up and try a  
different
set of long / short and other tweaks---possibly try running the entire
chapter long / short.

   - flip through making sure that no hyphenated words appear at the end
of a recto.

   - as a last resort, adjust leading on pages which can't be made to
come out any other way.

If you have a more complex badness function you may wind up with fewer
possibilities, non? But I must admit I have not read that thesis.

Sorry about that - that is just a cut-down article. The thesis itself
is considerably longer and bears the title "On the Pagination of
Complex, Book-Like Documents"

Yes, I never liked those ones either. Happens frequently though due to
the penalty settings (in article.cls, this \@beginparpenalty is -51,
so a break is encouraged).

Unfortunately, I don't know if it is available anywhere.

PSPACE, EXP, and countless others. (OK, strictly speaking we don't know if
NP=PSPACE=EXP, so I'd be better off citing e.g. NEXP, since NEXP!=NP by
the time-hierarchy theorem).

Or maybe optimal pagination is undecidable :-)

What you describe is a 7-bit input method for Greek, introduced in  
1989 (?) by dear Silvio Levy. Those romantic pre-Unicode days are far  
far away... (together with our youth ;-)

I would suggest you use XeTeX and input your text directly in UTF-8  
using one of the many keyboards available.

To use GFS Porson with XeTeX just ask for \font\x="GFSPorson-Regular"
(as the font is called on my Mac system).

I'm including a TeX file and the resulting PDF: it is a small Greek  
text written in GFS Porson.

Yes, I'd realised that when I asked the question :-)

However, I remember the days when it took several seconds to typeset a
single page, and I wouldn't expect to need a technique like this until very
late in the process if it was very slow, so I wouldn't really mind if it
took a few minutes to typeset a book (on my main computer here, typesetting
a 600-page novel, even with pdfTeX's font expansion in use, takes a little
more than a second, so even if an improved breaking algorithm took 100
times as long, it still would be faster than Ye Olde Dayes; I used to quite
enjoy watching the slow progress as the [n] count0 markers slowly appeared
--- a visceral pleasure that modern equipment denies me :-) ).

I wouldn't be surprised if the perfect algorithm doesn't exist, or
theoretically takes infinite time, but still if a nearly-perfect algorithm
solves 90% of the current bad breaks and runs 100 times as slowly as
current TeX, I would regard that as a worthwhile improvement.

Aye, there lays the rub! A lot of this is subjective and any algorithm  
would need the ability to control things like:

  - place only one image on the first page (or no images)
  - do not trap white space when placing multiple figures on a page
  - create / do _not_ create asymmetrical pages / arrangements (toggle  
for this)
  - &c.

All of which I'm struggling w/ for almost a dozen new titles we're  
doing.

I want output like this (using random text):

         Vim modus	tractatos suscipiantur at . . . . . . . . ius

cu homero nominati	mediocrem feugait nusquam per et  . . . . sanctus

So three columns. First column is right justified. The second column is 
left justified. The third column is left justified. I want dots (. . .) 
between the middle and last column.

Here is what I have for now:

\begin{tabular}{ r l l }

         Vim modus  &   tractatos suscipiantur at & ius \\

cu homero nominati  &   mediocrem feugait nusquam per et  &  sanctus \\

         consulatu  &   concludaturque  & mei \\

    Dicat legendos  &   concludaturque ne ius tale  & dicit \\

\end{tabular}

(My latex example here has not dots.)

Any ideas on how to get these dots done automatically?

Maybe something like this (sorry, I do not know how
to force \begin {tabular} to create the equivalent
of an \halign to \hsize {}) --

\documentclass {minimal}
\begin {document}
\begin {tabular}{ r l l }
                     & \hbox to 0,6 \hsize {} & \\
          Vim modus  &   tractatos suscipiantur at \dotfill & ius \\
cu homero nominati  &   mediocrem feugait nusquam per et \dotfill &  sanctus \\
          consulatu  &   concludaturque \dotfill & mei \\
     Dicat legendos  &   concludaturque ne ius tale \dotfill & dicit \\
\end {tabular}
\end {document}

I'm sure a wizard could get the \dotfill into the preamble,
but LaTeX remains more-or-less impenetrable to me :-(

I'm far from being a wizard, but this works for me:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{array}
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{ r l<{\dotfill} l }
%                  & \hbox to 0,6 \hsize {}             & \\

\end{tabular}
\end{document}

Hope that helps,

No doubt my youth is long gone. But one reason I've used TeX all these years
is that it is open, free, and stable. I can *still* run TeX on files I wrote
in the early 1980s and they are formatted just fine. Granted, the fonthandling
in plain TeX is clunky. But I wrote a set of clunky fonthandling macros that 
have worked well all these years, and I'm reluctant to go to something that is
not the clear successor to TeX, something I can count on for the next decade or
two. Things are still pretty unsettled in the font world for me to want to jump
to XeTeX, or Omega, or...

I can see the appeal. But plain TeX has served me well over the years, with
nothing but a simple command-line in front of me, and since I can get 95% of
what I need out of Porson in this setup, it seems as though it might just be
possible to get the last 5% too.

BTW: You get a circumflex in GFSPorson by preceding the vowel with "\~".

The only thing left to resolve in my obsolete 7-bit method is how to get the
breathing characters combined with the circumflex now. (They don't stack, not
a great decision.) So close...

The font is in the LGR encoding. The input of greek text is described
here:

ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/tex/language/greek/doc/usage.pdf

Since LGR uses ligatures for the accented characters, there might be
problems with the hyphenation if using plain ascii. I use mostly emacs
with greek babel input translation and LaTeX with the utf8x inputenc.
At least

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[greek]{babel}
\usepackage{gfsporson}
\begin{document}
\^o
\end{document}

gives me a omega with a circumflex.

Message-ID: <7B822BA1-90BA-46BC-B1FB-26E5D1A55EF5@auckland.ac.nz>



The bibliography style that I have been using up to now prints ``et

as in ``Jones, et al. (1942)'' in italics.  I'm trying to use natbib,  
which
prints the ``et al.'' in the ``regular'' font.  I'd like to keep the  
italic
font.  (Please don't argue about which is ``correct''.  I want to use  
italic
font for ``et al.''.  Humour me.)

Is there any way to instruct natbib to use italics for ``et al.''?

Thanks.

The manual suggests a LaTeX macro for entering rough/smooth breathing on
the circumflex. It doesn't seem to work in GFS Porson -- there isn't any
macro defined in porson.fd or porson.sty to do the work that's done in
Teubner.

The document usage.pdf claims that a prefixed tilde produces a circumflex.
But it doesn't, even in the document -- everywhere there is supposed to be
a circumflex in the output, there is only a blank space in the pdf file!

Preceding the tilde with a backslash in GFS Porson results in a simple
circumflex: \~v produces an omega with a circumflex. What I can't find
is how to combine the circumflex with smooth/rough breathing.

Greetings Peter,

I agree with Yannis, in that XeTeX is far more likely to allow you to  
work with polytonic Greek in a straightforward fashion.  My experience  
using 7-bit workarounds is that a) it's a pain to type, b) it's easy  
to make mistakes and c) it can be quite difficult to read the  
resulting text when you come back to it later.  Given that XeTeX  
allows you to directly enter UTF-8 text, it would be a way to solve  
all three of these problems.

You mentioned that you've got a legacy issue that prevents you from  
moving to XeTeX, in that you have built a large collection of macros  
that you depend on extensively.  My impression has been that XeTeX (as  
opposed to XeLaTeX) strives to be a drop-in replacement for (plain)  
TeX.  If that were so, you *ought* to be able to use the majority of  
your macros directly, or with a certain minimum amount of porting.   
However, I am a newcomer to the TeX universe, and could easily be off  
base.

Cheers,
Erik

As you suggest, the subjectivity may make the job difficult, but if you can 
choose an objective measure of acceptability of page-breaks (hopefully roughly 
coinciding with your subjective judgments), then optimal pagination of any 
particular document won't be *logically* undecidable: just try every 
possibility, and choose the one with the best measure of acceptability.

For those interested, the TeX Development Fund's wishlist at 
https://www.tug.org/tc/devfund/criteria.html includes:
"Page-breaking: apply something like the same optimization to breaking pages 
in the document as is done for breaking lines in a paragraph. Perhaps 
something can be done by having TeX output the boxes in the log file with 
\showlists, and then writing a separate program, as described in Jonathan 
Fine's article TeX Forever in the EuroTeX 2005 proceedings. (Research level.)"

Thank you Susan and Philip. \dotfill worked for me.

I didn't try all your ideas but just used like:

\begin{longtable}[b]{ p{2.2in} p{2.2in} p{1.3in} }
\raggedleft{foo}& bar \dotfill & baz \\
\end{longtable}

Now a new question ... why doesn't the [b] for bottom work for me? I have 
long lines that wrap within their table cells so I want the next lines to 
match up -- so if they all were forced to the bottom vertical alignment 
bottom of the row then it would line up.

(By the way the format above is for a permuted KWIC (keyword in context) 
index. If you want to see it email me off-list and I will point you a 
URL.)

Yes; that's exactly what I was thinking. I bet DEK would have done this in
the original TeX if only CPU cycles weren't so expensive back then. It does
seem like a very logical extension of what we currently have.

You'd think this would make an interesting thesis topic for someone. Well,
I think that, anyway :-)

For any package maintainers: if you have pending updates to get out to
TeX Live 2008 users, please submit the changes to CTAN within another
week or so.

Soon we will stop TL 2008 updates, in preparation for TL 2009.  For
various reasons it is not practical to do keep doing 08 updates all the
way until 09 is ready.  Take my word for it, please :).

Unfortunately this means there will be a hiatus in package updates
flowing from CTAN to TL to users, possibly a couple months in duration
(if we're lucky), going from past experience.

So I thought I'd send out this note in case there were authors close to
making notable updates, to avoid unwelcome surprises.

A true Porson oughtn't to produce a tilde in any case.  The tilde is a 
Didot form of
perispomene, and one of the distinguishing marks of Porson is the simple 
rounded
cap for perispomene (based on Porson's own handwriting.)

Post-positive sequences for polytonic Greek are far from dead.  Look at 
Kryukov's
Thessalonica for Open Office.  (disclosure --- the Ibycus sequencing is 
my contribution.)
I continue to use sequences (which just happen to fit into 7-bit ASCII) 
because my aging
memory can't keep up with the all the ALT CTL FUNC key chordal fingering 
you need for
getting eight bits out of a normal keyboard.

It's hard-coded into the .bst files.  You'll need to make a copy of the
appropriate one, give it a new name and edit the part which prints "et al."

I wondered whether it isn't much more basic. I guessed "figures point by point" means "bit map images", and they can be dedected by file extensions ".bmp". Moreover, you can sort files by size in the basic file list window of your OS, to see the largest ones on top of the list. -- HTH, Uwe.

I strongly agree.  The Porphyrogenitus project uses Levy/Beccari
encoding, which is (IMHO) simple and straightforward to deal with.
I have been liaising with Peter King offline regarding
the placement of breathing and accents.

And here's how to do it:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{array}
\begin{document}
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{0.5em}
\begin{tabular}{rp{0.6\hsize}<{\space\dotfill}@{\space}l}
           Vim modus & tractatos suscipiantur at         & ius     \\
  cu homero nominati & mediocrem feugait nusquam per et  & sanctus \\
           consulatu & concludaturque                    & mei     \\
      Dicat legendos & concludaturque ne ius tale        & dicit   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{document}

The \setlength{\tabcolsep}{0.5em} command is just a reminder of how to
change intercolumn space and the @{\space} in the table preamble is a
reminder pf how to do it "per column".

As a final comment, let me once again advertise Robin Fairbairns' "The UK
TeX FAQ", usually linked at the bottom of every single posting to this list.

The [b] you introduced does not align the cells of the table, but the table
in whole. What you probably want is to replace the last p{1.3in} by
b{1.3in} (this needs the array package). It creates a cell like the p{}
cells, but vertically fixed to the bottom of its cell.

(Untested this time, but even if it is not correct, the hint to check the
array package for such column definitions should lead you to the correct
one in case I fumbled.)

Hope that helps,

	Susan

That's because, as the longtable manual states: "The [t] [b] [c] argument of
tabular can not be used."  In any case, it's for vertical alignment of the
entire table and not individual cells.

Try this:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{array,longtable}
\begin{document}
\begin{longtable}{>{\raggedleft}b{2.2in}b{2.2in}b{1.3in}}
  foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo
  foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo foo
  & bar \dotfill & baz \\
\end{longtable}
\end{document}

Cheers,  Phil

Yes, this is definitely wrong. The tilde produces the tilde-accent
with the politonikogreek.

Sorry, I'm not much familiar with greek, but as I see, there is no
character in the font with a circumflex in it. There is even no
circumflex in the LGR encoding. And v is not in the translantion
table.

Do you actually want the unicode character 1F67: "GREEK SMALL LETTER
OMEGA WITH DASIA AND PERISPOMENI"? This is \char'301 in the LGR encoding
and it's ascii input is <~w:

\documentclass{article}

True, *but* nevertheless there is a tilde in the original Monotype  
design of Porson (for me the only authentic Porson). As you can see on  
the atatched screenshot, in the sixth box of the first row there is a  
lovely eta with tilde (whose PostScript name is etatildealt). Of  
course all combinations with breathings are missing, so we can  
consider as "an exception confirming the rule". Probably some  
important Monotype client asked for it, and so they added it to the  
glyph set.

Just as they added also the hideous "accented capitals" for monotonic  
Greek which would make poor old Porson turn around in his grave...

The only excuse for that might be the use of the tilde for the 
suspension of nu or mu, but I rather doubt that. 

Monotype may be the only "authentic" Porson right now, but it does make 
the break with Porson's odd combination of
upright uppercase with oblique lowercase.  (Probably a good idea, on the 
whole.)  Why on earth anyone would want to do
Monotonic ALPHATONOS in a Porson font, I cannot imagine. Isn't Greek 
Souvenir enough for everybody?

Can't make this work. Just adding \global does not seem to solve the issue.

Good morning!

I'm having some trouble getting graphics.sty to work. When I try to 
include it (or graphicx, which calls it), I get the following error:

! Missing number, treated as zero.
<to be read again>
                    $
l.29 \catcode`\^^A
                   =\catcode`\%

I tried getting a fresh version of the package, but I get the same 
error. It seems to happen whether I call graphics or graphicx (the line 
getting errored is in graphics.sty), and whether I call them with or 
without the [pdftex] option (I'm using pdftex). For what it's worth, I 
have no trouble with the beamer class, which is calling these packages 
on its own. I get this problem with article, report, and book classes 
(all I've tried). I'm running teTeX through TeXShop on a mac with os 
10.3.9. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks much!

Please post a minimal example. This is a standard package ans works fine
for most people.

My code doesn't not "just add" \global. I have made some more
changes.

Just do not define a new environment for this purpose. Use \begin{lrbox}{\mybox}...\end{lrbox} which serves this purpose already.

Thanks to all for the suggestions and help. Now it's down to a precise
question: how to combine circumflex with rough/smooth breathing, using
7-bit encoding. GFS Porson seems *not* to use Levy-Beccari encoding for
this, nor any readily discoverable scheme. I guess I'll just have to
print out all the glyphs and access the necessary ones via \char or some
such clunky system -- unless anyone has a better thought.

That depends on what kind of page layouts you wish to obtain. If you
describe more in detail what you want to achieve, I am sure someone will
find a solution.

The commands for fancyhdr can be easily repeated each chapter, if that's
necessary.

Hello Today I wrote a hack for longtable.sty that it actually makes

Now this code makes longtable.sty typeset tables from right to left. But it
unfortunately does not make longtable to break table when a page is
finished. For eaxmple I have attached a tex file and its pdf output.


Can you please tell me how can I solve the issue?

Hi!

I installed Texlive 2008 using the installer-tl script I downloaded
from TUG a few weeks ago.  Everything seemed to go well, but when I
ran tlmgr today, I got the following error:

"Fundamental package bin-texlive not present, that is sooo bad."

I can't figure out a way to fix this.  What can I do?

Thanks,

But then I need a minibox to handle more than a single paragraph?

The idea of creating a new environment is to make a comprehensive and
elegant interface for a package. The same thing can be achieved with a
command, but an environment should have been a more elegant solution,
in my opinion.

Message-ID: <dd258e120905111303n44c3e737g3b1463f198312478@mail.gmail.com>

This is a frequent question and I have read numerous articles and
hotwos on the internet, but still fail.

What I want to do is to create versions of Georgia (jgi) and Verdana
(jvn) fonts for use with LaTeX. It works fairly well with pdfTeX
(which have native support for TrueType fonts), but I can't get this
to work with DVI files. In MikTeX, it does not work at all, and in
texlive the font encoding seem corrupted (for example, the character
'h' is displayed as something completely different).

How can I install TrueType fonts in LaTeX with working DVI support?
Converting them to PostScript? Using fontinst (which is a competent
but complex beast)? Or has someone already gone through the work of
adapting the Microsoft core fonts for LaTeX and can send me the
relevant files?

It was indeed not a perfect idea to use a box environment for storing something. The lrbox environment stores a horizontal list, while you may rather want to store just code, i.e. (?), a list of tokens. -- I can tell you something simple for this, but not tonight, and perhaps 

     http://www.ctan.org/pkg/collect 

already helps. -- I found this on 

    http://mirror.ctan.org/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html

maybe there is more.

    How can I install TrueType fonts in LaTeX with working DVI support?

Since dvips does not support truetype (volunteer programmers welcome :),
you have to convert them to Type 1.

    adapting the Microsoft core fonts for LaTeX and can send me the
    relevant files?

I was under the impression that the license of the MS core fonts
prohibited their translation to other formats.

Technically speaking, going from TrueType to Type 42 is not really a  
conversion but rather an encapsulation...

But maybe M$ lawyers do not agree with that assertion.

Most font vendors disallow you to change their fonts.  But they all
are happy if you put a subset rather than the whole font into the
documents you distribute.  No idea what they really want.  :)

Hi David,

(Thanks for renewing your TUG membership!)

    "Fundamental package bin-texlive not present, that is sooo bad."

My best guess is that there was some temporary connectivity problem and
the new tlpdb did not fully download.  You may want to choose a mirror
explicitly from the list (http://ctan.org/mirrors).

Hope this helps,
Karl

No -- but desired.

My best bet so far is to use the ttf2tex script, but that one is
rather old, outdated and not completely compatible with texlive. With
some manual tweaking, however, it works with pdfTeX -- but ordinary
TeX and DVI files fail.

I also had a look at the winfonts package, but that one does not
follow the Karl Berry font naming scheme. I kind of like those cryptic
font names. :-)

I'll try to better explain what I want: only <some text> should be shifted
down, but not the text following it.  In other words, <some text> should be
output by TeX n lines forward respect to where it is in the source, but not the
rest of the text.

OK, try this :

<pre-text>

\vtop to 0 pt
\bgroup
\strut
\vskip n-1\baselineskip
<some text>
\vss

Subject: [texhax] TrueType Font for Latex without success
Message-ID: <55773.212.147.43.113.1242232359.squirrel@mail.xnos.de>

Dear listmembers,

I have spent my day on trying to figure out how to make latex use a
commercial TTF (Strada). Of course I read the guideline available at
http://www.radamir.com/tex/ttf-tex.htm. But it did not work for me.
When generating the dvi or pdf, I get the warning

"LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape T1/str/m/n undefined".

str is the name I have chosen for the font.
My .fd look like that:

\ProvidesFile{t1str.fd}[Strada Family]

\DeclareFontFamily{T1}{str}{}

\DeclareFontShape{T1}{str}{b}{n}{<->ecstfbd}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{str}{b}{it}{<-> ecstfbdit}{}

\DeclareFontShape{T1}{str}{m}{n}{<-> ecstfrg}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{str}{m}{it}{<-> ecstfrgit}{}

\DeclareFontShape{T1}{str}{bx}{n}{<->ssub * str/b/n}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{str}{bx}{it}{<->ssub * str/b/it}{}

\endinput


The .tfm and .vf files are named as follows:
(r)ecstfbd for StradaTF Bold
(r)ecstflt for StradaTF Light
(r)ecstfrg for StradaTF Regular
(r)ecstfsbd for StradaTF Semi-Bold
and 4 files (r)ec...it for italic (.vf and .tfm), so there are 8 .vf and
16 .tfm files. I have used T1-WGL4.enc and added the lines

recstflt   STfLt___.ttf Encoding=T1-WGL4.enc
recstfrg   STfRg___.ttf Encoding=T1-WGL4.enc
recstfsbd   STfSBd__.ttf Encoding=T1-WGL4.enc
recstfbd   STfBd___.ttf Encoding=T1-WGL4.enc
recstfltit   STfLtIt_.ttf Encoding=T1-WGL4.enc
recstfsbdit   STfSBdIt.ttf Encoding=T1-WGL4.enc
recstfbdit   STfBdIt_.ttf Encoding=T1-WGL4.enc
recstfrgit   STfRgIt_.ttf Encoding=T1-WGL4.enc

to the ttfonts.map.

tex testfont
ends up with a .dvi that I have converted to pdf to prove the result. It
works fine. But when performing a test in LaTeX, things look different. I
tried this with a simple document:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\usefont{T1}{str}{m}{n}
Hello, I hope being typeset in StradaTF Regular
\end{document}

LaTeX then warns about the undefined font shape and replaces it with
T1/cmr/m/n.

Can anyone out there please tell me what is wrong here or give me some hint?
Thanks in advance.

Ah, sorry: ProTeXt-2.2 (MikTeX 2.7 + TeXnicCenter) on XP SP3

cheers,

josuah

I would say LaTeX doesn't find the fd. Is the name t1str.fd? Where
did you put it? Did you update the FNDB?

Beste mensen,

Ik zou u het volgende willen vragen:
Ik ben lid van de TeX gebruikersgroep.
Aangezien er voor de windows tex gebruikers een postscript viewer nodig 
is, gebruiken er veel mensen GSView, maar daar zitten kosten aan verbonden.
Als je GSView gratis wil blijven gebruiken, krijg je iedere keer een 
pop-up window waaraan je herinnerd wordt dat je hier eigenlijk voor moet 
betalen.
Linux tex gebruikers kunnen het gratis Ghostview programma gebruiken, 
maar dit kan ik nergens vinden om het te downloaden voor windows.
Zou iemand mij daarbij kunnen helpen?
Alvast bedankt.

Met vriendelijke groet,
Carl Schneider

Sorry, I am unable to write Dutch, pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ indicates that 
there is no Ghostview for Windows, and I don't know about the GSview 
behavior (which I have experienced myself), but according to my experience, 
you needn't worry about this if you use the MiKTeX installation. You can 
download MiKTeX 2.7 for free from www.miktex.org.

Cheers,

     Uwe.

Hi Carl,
as far as I understand, you are looking for a free PostScript previewer
for Windows.

TeX Live provides a very powerful free PostScript/PDF previewer for
Windows, called PSView.

Better,

P.S.: This is easier for pasting from the clipboard or autocomplete than 
wrapping. I have spent weeks (I'm afraid) wrapping paragraphs with 
\begin{sloppypar} ... \end{sloppypar} -- damned! -- instead of 
{\sloppy\par}. Likewise {\centering\par} ... Cf. TeXbook exercise 14.15.

Subject: [texhax] Memoir: running chapter titles
Message-ID: <4A112C8E.9090902@eyremail.net>

I'm trying to create a book style that has the Chapter-name, 
chapter-number and chapter-title on the left header and the 
corresponding section stuff on the right. I've got the section stuff 
working, but I can't figure out what variable holds the running  chapter 
title.

In other words, I want the left page header to be:
Chapter 3: Background
where
Chapter = \@chapapp
3 = \thechapter
Background = the running chapter title (Background in this example)

I can get the header I want when I use \f at rhdr, but it doesn't compile 
cleanly, and complains it doesn't know what \f at rhdr is, even tho it 
works correctly when I examine the dvi file.

So, is there a variable that will compile cleanly that holds the 
chaptertitle variable? Here's the relevant code:

\renewcommand{\leftmark}{\rheadrfont 
\@chapapp\hspace{3pt}\thechapter:\smlspc \f at rhdr} %% (works but doesn't 
compile cleanly)
\makeevenhead{newps}{\thepage\headspc\leftmark}{}{}  %% newps is my 
pagestyle

have a look at my article about memoir pagestyles, in

note that it is important that you have the latest version of memoir.

I am miktex user and using the pdflatex, the figures are in .pdf format. In figures the .otf fonts have been used when i process this figures through pdflatex some characters are missing, because it is not with in 256 characters.

Is there any way to skip the figure portion like .eps by using pdflatex or any suggestion to solve this problem.

Thanks

Which application are you using to make your PDF illustrations? If  
Adobe Illustrator, for example ---it has an option to embed fonts; and  
if that fails, it has another option to convert text to outlines.

Best,

Axel

That's weird. Did you make the figures or did you receive them from  
someone else?

If you made them, which application did you use?

If you received them, do you have in your system the fonts that were  
used?

Best,

Axel

Dear All,

I've defined commands as follows:

\definecolor{LBRed}{rgb}{0.9,0.1,0.2}
\definecolor{LBBlue}{rgb}{0.4,0.3,1.0}

\newcommand{\morerefadd}[1]{{\color{LBBlue}#1}}
\newcommand{\morerefchange}[2]{{\color{LBRed}#1}{\color{LBBlue}#2}}
\newcommand{\morerefdel}[1]{{\color{LBRed}#1}}

to do revision tracking and highlighting on a document.

Now, I want to put a space between two words (because words should
have spaces between!) with something like

\morerefadd{ }

but the space doesn't appear in the output of LaTeX.  In fact, even
when I put

\morerefadd{ some other text}

the initial space doesn't appear.  Any ideas please?

Could this be related to the bug in Acrobat reader 8, which makes all

Not only the varphi, but pi as well.

I don't think so, as I see the same (missing symbols) with TeXShop,  
Reader 9 and Acrobat 6 on a Mac.)

Mahi,

You're using pdfTeX 1.20, and I'm using pdfTeX 1.40.9, so the first  
solution might not work for you, but the second most certainly will.

1) Don't convert yourself the EPS figures to PDF ---let epstopdf do  
it; the following works for me:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{epstopdf}
\epstopdfsetup{update,prepend}
\begin{document}

Just a test:

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics{nj275598fig5}%
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\end{document}

Just like that ---call the graphic by its name, without extension.

2) We are using different pdfTeX versions (and I'm sure different  
versions of epstopdf), but we have the *same* version of Illustrator,  
so this will work for you:

First, backup your figures so you can make changes easily afterwards.  
Now, with the figures you will actually use in your TeX document, open  
the EPS file in Illustrator, select the text, go to menu Type and  
select Create Outlines. Characters will become just another graphic  
element. That's why you need a backup ---to edit text easily if you  
have to.

Best,

Axel

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{pstricks}
\definecolor{LBRed}{rgb}{0.9,0.1,0.2}
\definecolor{LBBlue}{rgb}{0.4,0.3,1.0}
\newcommand{\morerefadd}[1]{{\color{LBBlue}#1}}
\begin{document}
Sometimes I miss out\morerefadd{ }spaces from my text.  Sometimes I
even forget\morerefadd{ whole clauses}.
\end{document}

As I said, Philip's \relax idea fixes the problem.

Indeed, \textcolor{blue}{...} needs the \relax just like {\color{blue}...} for the leading space, thus behaves unlike \textrm{...}. I consider this a color bug, but can't afford ... Tested with A\morerefadd{ B }C (where the *final* space *always* appeared). Sorry -- Uwe.

This isn't what you asked..., but I'm sure you agree with me that the  
typography in your figure is truly *awful*. Why don't you do it the  
LaTeX way? Strip the typography from your figure and use the wonderful  
overpic package. I'm attaching the pdfTeX file and the resulting PDF.

Best,

Axel

Hi

If i process pdflatex with below example 

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{epstopdf}
\epstopdfsetup{update,prepend}
\begin{document}

Just a test:

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics{nj275598fig5}%
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\end{document}

 
I am getting an error as

Error: pdflatex (file nj275598fig5.pdf): cannot find image file
 ==> Fatal error occurred, the output PDF file is not finished!


And thank you for the suggestion but i don't want to process my figure through pstricks. If any other suggestion kindly advise.


Is there any other way to process the figure through pdflatex without changing the fonts inside the figures.

Thanks

Well ---as I said in a previous mail, you're using pdfTeX 1.20, and I  
have version 1.40.9 (and I'm sure a different version of epstopdf.sty)  
so I can't reproduce your problem.

I never recommended pstricks, because, unfortunately and to my shame,  
I don't know pstricks.

Only what I already told you ---to covert in Illustrator the  
characters to outlines.

I don't think you'll find someone with the time to guide you step by  
step (unless, of course, you hire a consultant). It seems to me that  
you should better accept the fact that you will have to read some  
documents and books.

If you're new to LaTeX, I would start with

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/

I haven't used it, but maybe the memoir class will be good for you  
(certainly its manual will):

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/

You should already have the above documents in your MiKTeX distribution.


As for books, I would recommend

Helmut Kopka & Patrick W. Daly: Guide to LaTeX, 4th ed.

and

Frank Mittelbach et al.: The LaTeX Companion, 2nd ed.


Best,

Axel

Subject: [texhax] vertical setting of binary symbols
Message-ID: <BF6A4061-222B-4564-B3C6-CC0AA1C0144F@tufts.edu>

I am having trouble creating a good version of the composition symbol  
(if one exists, I'd like to know).

I find \circ alone a bit too big, so am using \mathsmaller{\circ}.  In  
response to an earlier posting, I
expanded this to \mathbin{\mathsmaller{\circ}}, which gives a  
reasonable horizontal spacing.  But I am observing a
different problem:  the code
***********
\newcommand{\compose}{\mathbin{\mathsmaller\circ}}
**********
results in a vertical spacing which is constant, but doesn't look that  
way:  when the
surrounding functions are lower case, it looks fine, but with upper- 
case function names
there is the illusion that the circle is nearly at floor level:   
apparently it is centered (vertically)
on the height of a lower-case letter, and so does not appear centered  
when the surrounding
letters are upper-case.  (see attached output below)

In response to my earlier posting about this problem, it was suggested  
I use \vcenter,
but the code
************
\newcommand{\compose}{\mathbin{\vcenter{$\mathsmaller\circ}$}}
************
leads to crazy behavior:  in some instances, the function following  
the \compose symbol is either
tabbed very far to the right, or even appears on a new line.

Is there a way to control this so that with upper-case function names  
the composition symbol
appears higher?

I had corrected (here!) this mistake of mine into 

    \newcommand{\compose}{\mathbin{\vcenter{\hbox{$\mathsmaller\circ}$}}}

so \vcenter does not take an entire line + tested.

Please take a look at TUG's "getting started" page: 
http://www.tug.org/begin.html. Hopefully this will help with the 
basics. Online LaTeX documentation, books, sample code and links to 
other resources are listed here.

If you seek additional help, you might consider asking someone listed 
on the consultants page: http://www.tug.org/consultants.html.

I hope this helps, somehow.

the source for the texbook is usually included in most LaTeX dists, it 
is for looking at the code, compiling it is not allowed.

There is certainly a clear warning against printing out the TeXbook from 
the file that has been included in TeX distributions since the 
beginning.  But that is setting and printing the entire book---not quite 
the same as extracting bits of the code from an appendix---and one would 
have to knowingly modify the head of the TeXbook file to do so.  I am 
not sure that the intentions are to prevent a something like a 
drag-and-drop extraction of bits of DEK's TeX code.  Reuse of published 
code is largely regarded as an honorable and sensible way to improve 
programs. On an X-based display (from Open Office to Emacs, as an 
example) extracts would not take very long, especially since much of it 
would be irrelevant and unwanted.

The code of the whole TeXBook is on CTAN at
http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=texbook

But it is just there as an example of the business of writing a book in TeX
and you should not TeX it. In fact at the beginning of the file Knuth says

hi, pierre,
since i've been called in, here's my take.
the contents of appendix e are examples.
examples are meant to be used as models,
and this does often include the direct use
of code fragments.  i believe don wouldn't
mind the extraction of *fragments* from
the source of appendix e -- as peter seibel
implies, that's a good way to avoid typing
errors.

however, peter also says
  ...  I want to play with the code he used to typeset the book ...
and as has been pointed out elsewhere, that's
directly available in the core tex distribution
as manmac.tex.  that file carries absolutely no
prohibitions, so it looks to me to be the best
place to start.

That's the one, thanks.

And apologies to everyone for my unclear wording. When I said "I want
to play with the code he used to typeset the book" I should have said
something like, "I want to play with the code he typeset the book
with." I already have a store-bought copy of the TeXBook right here on
my table; I'm just trying to avoid manually typing in a bunch of code
before I play with it.

I have my own book to typeset and I'm pretty sure Donald Knuth would
approve of my looking at his macros as a way of figuring out how to
write my own macros to typeset my own book. Why am I pretty sure of
this? Because my book is a book of interviews with famous programmers
including Knuth himself and when I spoke with him he said, among other
things: "There?s this overemphasis on reusable software where you
never get to open up the box and see what?s inside the box. It?s nice
to have these black boxes but, almost always, if you can look inside
the box you can improve it and make it work better once you know
what?s inside the box."

-Peter

P.S. Yes I know about the existence of LaTeX and memoir but I think my
book is simple enough, typographically, that I can get away with not
having to learn those on top of TeX. Plus it's more in the spirit of
Knuth's philosophy, as evidenced by the quote above, to do it this
way.

P.P.S. The other reason I'm pretty sure Knuth would approve of me
going to almost any lengths to figure out enough TeX to use it for my
book is because there's a danger that otherwise the publisher is
actually going to "typeset" it using Microsoft Word!

where \plainoutput is a macro defined with \def. Then in Appendex E
(p. 417) I see:

  \output{\onepageout{\unvbox255}}

without an '='. What's the difference?

None. 

Or better: the '='.

Or see TeXbook p. 275 on '<equals>': "in all cases this sign is optional".

Hi Maheshwari,
please look into the VnTeX documentation.  It's usually in
texmf*/doc/generic/vntex.  vntex.txt contains a few examples.  If you
only have to typeset a few Vietnamese words, read vntex-min.pdf,
which is in the same directory.

Here is a minimal example:

  \documentclass{report}
  \usepackage[T5]{fontenc}
  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} 
  \usepackage[vietnam]{babel}
  \begin{document}
     Ti?ng Vi?t
  \end{document}

There is also a mailing list for questions about VnTeX:

   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/vntex-users

Feel free to ask there if you have any questions.

A new version of VnTeX is on CTAN already, but is not in MikTeX yet
(and I don't know if you can install it on MikTeX 2.4).  But maybe you
want to look into the improved documentation:

http://ctan.org/tex-archive/language/vietnamese/vntex/doc/generic/vntex

Please note that vntex.sty is new, but it's not mandatory.  Using
babel is preferred for multilingual documents anyway.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Is there some simple way to set text in white on a black background?
I'm thinking of a small section, not a whole page. Something similar
to what you'd get with this bit of HTML:

  <span style="background: black; color: white">123</span>

As usual, my Googling and following various leads through the TeXBook
hasn't turned up anything but I could easily be missing something
obvious.

Oh, I should have specified, I'm trying to do this in Plain TeX, not
LaTeX, if possible.

-Peter

P.S. Is it still the case tthat LaTeX is just a set of macros on plain
TeX? And if so, is my inference correct that anything you can do in
LaTeX, can be done -- perhaps at the cost of reimplementing big chunks
of LaTeX -- in plain TeX?

My well-thumbed 1994 copy of Tom Rokicki's DVIPS manual Dvips: A 
DVI-to-PostScript Translator (for version 5.58c)
 gives an example of highlighted text on page 9 that could easily be 
modified for white-on-black.

Similarly, one could use the pdftex primitive \pdfliteral to insert
PDF code when using pdftex.  I personally think that PostScript is
much easier to use than PDF, but the basic concept is the same.

A probably much more convenient way is to use the miniltx package in
order to use the LaTeX graphics package in plain TeX.  I never tried
myself.  From the catalogue:

 | Part of the plain TeX graphics collection which allows the use of
 | LaTeX's graphics, colour, and picture mode commands in plain TeX
 | based formats.

Yes.  As mentioned, there is miniltx.

Also, Eplain (built on plain) uses miniltx and can load the color (but
not xcolor) LaTeX package.
See http://tug.org/eplain/doc/eplain/Loading-LaTeX-packages.html and
subsections.  If digging into the exact specials to use doesn't appeal
to you, I surmise this is the easiest way to go.

Would you please point me in the right direction, maybe a website

Once you've installed Ubuntu, you can ask its own package manager to install 
texlive for you. You might also want to ask it to install texlive-latex-extra 
(which I needed for comment.sty, for example).

In general, if you want to install something on Ubuntu, the package manager is 
a good place to look, because you can be reasonably sure that the version it 
provides has been tested with the rest of Ubuntu. I think Synaptic is still 
the default graphical user interface for Ubuntu's package manager.

Yes, I neglected to mention that Ubuntu still seems to be using TeX Live 2007. 
Do you need a more up-to-date installation, or are you happy to wait until 
Ubuntu catches up? (I have no idea how long it will take them to do so.)

I've used texlive's only installer on my Ubuntu systems for
some time now, precisely because they (Ubuntu folk) don't seem
interested in keeping up to date. Kind of strange for a distro so
dedicated to internationalization.

Just make symlinks (the installer gives you that option) to
someplace in your path, and you're home free...

Does anyone know *why* the Ubuntu distros are so far behind
in this critical area?

Mark

    Does anyone know *why* the Ubuntu distros are so far behind
    in this critical area?

Ubuntu comes from Debian.

Norbert Preining is the main person who packaged TL for Debian.

In 2008, Norbert was too busy working on the general TL infrastructure
to have time to update the Debian packages.  Therefore Debian is still
on TL 2007.

Norbert is doing a lot again for TL 2009, of course, but I think he
hopes to package it for Debian after it's released.

I don't know when TL 2009 will be released.  By the end of the summer?
We'll see.

Subject: [texhax] combing adjacent macros
Message-ID: <D940FE5C-BD2D-4714-BD6C-B4593F2D142F@cs.stanford.edu>

I am a novice Tex user, but would like to find a method of combining  
adjacent macros that I define in a style sheet.

The macros are for a crossword typesetting, based on Gerd Nuegebauer's  
excellent cwpuzzle.dtx

I have defined macros for tags at the end of the clues, so I can keep  
the formatting consistent. They are very simple, such as

\newcommand\hyph{\emph{(hyph.)} %% hyphenated
\newcommand\var{\emph{(var.)} %% variation
\newcommand\slang{\emph{(slang)} %% slang term

etc.

In some cases, however, I have more than one tag. What I would like to  
do is then have a pair of adjacent macros expand like this:

\hyph\var -> (hyph., var)

I think I could create a recursive macro which checks the second  
command, and if it is in the same group of macros (there are perhaps 9  
that I have defined), combine them. But that would be 9 different  
definitions, with 9 different checks in each one - surely there is a  
better solution than that.

A general solution would be able to deal with an unlimited number of  
adjacent macros. And, it should be able to define a group composed of  
the 9 macros, and do the recursion based on the group, not each  
individual macro.

I fear I don't understand enough about Tex to approach the problem. I  
would appreciate any help or directions.

Message-ID: <40e4e7e50905241636l15403b33re9982de2102cae9e@mail.gmail.com>

I have this bit of TeX code:

   \line{\hfill\vbox{\hbox{Chapter}\hbox{8}}}

Which renders something like this (pardon my ASCII art):


|                                     Chapter|
|                                     8           |

What I want is for the "8" to be centered under the "Chapter" but with
the combined vbox flush right.

I've tried putting hfill's in the hbox containing the "8" but that
doesn't seem to do anything. I assume that that's because the width of
the hbox is still just big enough to hold the text--i.e. the hfill
doesn't cause the size of the enclosing box to expand. Is that about
right? And if so, is there an easy way to get the effect I want.
(Basically I want to force the bottom hbox to be the same width as the
top one but I don't want to specify some specific value for the widths
of the two hboxes.

Am I missing something obvious?

The important question is: are these used in a place where it is
always safe to look at the next character or command?  Things can
get messy looking ahead to see an alignment separator (&).  If they
are safe in general, are they safe to take a macro argument?  That
means they are never used right before }, or certain other contexts.

Here is my suggestion.  Expand the next token and look for a consistent
command name.  (Yes, \@ifnextchar can test commands.)

\makeatletter

\newcommand\cwtag[1]{%
  \cwtag at start \let\cwtag at start\relax % start and locally disable restart
  \emph{#1}%
  \expandafter\cwtag at tail
}

\newcommand\cwtag at tail{%
 \@ifnextchar\cwtag{\cwtag at join}{\cwtag at stop}%
 }
\newcommand\cwtag at start{\begingroup (}
\newcommand\cwtag at join{,\ }
\newcommand\cwtag at stop{)\endgroup}

\makeatother

\newcommand\hyph{\cwtag{hyph.} %% hyphenated
\newcommand\var{\cwtag{var.} %% variation
\newcommand\slang{\cwtag{slang} %% slang term

The tabular environment is probably th simplest solution:

\line{\hfill\vbox{%
  \tabcolsep=0pt % to keep things flush
  \begin{tabular}{c}

Dear list,

1. I'm using LaTeX for quite some time now and have always wondered why
there are two possibilities to typeset the "less or equal than" symbol.

Why are there two commands "le" and "leq" to typeset the same symbol?
Is it just for historical reasons or is there a "proper" way to do it?

2. Along the lines of "doing things properly":  There are certainly lots
of people out there who use on of the two following macros

\DeclareMathOperator{\ZZ}{\mathbb{Z}}
\DeclareMathOperator{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}

to typeset integers.  While the second one is shorter, a friend of mine
warned by about one-letter-macros labelling them "bad style".  Do you agree?

Kind regards,
Konstantin

The *.toc file is generated on each compilation which means that your  
changes will disappear as soon as you compile your TeX document again.

What am I doing in such cases is applying Perl scripts for post- 
processing of TOC files. You can put the Perl script in your make file  
so that it is ran whenever needed. The Perl script will then apply the  
same changes every time the TOC file is updated.

Sure, you are right but what I want is a script, generating from
foo.toc another file foo-toc.tex with the sole purpose to produce the
table of contents (foo-toc.pdf but not foo.pdf)  of foo.tex and which
can be modified. Sure latexing foo,tex would affect foo.toc but it
does not affect already produced foo-toc.tex or foo-toc.pdf which is
needed only seldom (say to be presented to granting agency or
whatever). Script does not seem to be a good option as the changes are
rather unpredictable.

Or, if you are using plain TeX, use \halign

\line{\hfill\vbox
   {\halign{\hfill#\hfill \cr

dear konstantin,

    1. I'm using LaTeX for quite some time now and have always wondered why
    there are two possibilities to typeset the "less or equal than" symbol.

    Why are there two commands "le" and "leq" to typeset the same symbol?
    Is it just for historical reasons or is there a "proper" way to do it?

the choice of which to use is usually
what is known as "house style"; in
most situations, the single or double
horizontal rule doesn't change the
meaning, but some publishers prefer
the single, and some the double rule.
(some mathematicians also have strong
preferences.)  so you could say it's
historical.

there's also a form in which the "equal
rule" is parallel to the lower arm of
the less-than.  again, mostly "house
style" or author preference.  but if
the rule is parallel to the upper arm
(equal or less than"), i've seen one,
two, and even three parallel rules
denoting different orders of a relation
that (not being a mathematician) i don't
really understand.  but i've spent
several years presenting published
examples of such symbols to the unicode
technical committee as documentation
supporting their addition to unicode,
so these statements are on firm ground.

    2. Along the lines of "doing things properly":  There are certainly lots
    of people out there who use on of the two following macros

    \DeclareMathOperator{\ZZ}{\mathbb{Z}}
    \DeclareMathOperator{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}

    to typeset integers.  While the second one is shorter, a friend of mine
    warned by about one-letter-macros labelling them "bad style".
    Do you agree?

i agree that using one-letter-macros is
"bad style".  but there's a solid reason:
plain.tex (knuth's "starter set") contains
definitions for many single-letter commands,
and these are taken over intact into latex.
because many of them are commands for
accents, which are treated differently with
different encodings and fonts, some packages
(notably hyperref) redefine them with the
assumption that they will still retain the
original meaning.  since even reasonably
experienced texers don't always remember
all of the one-letter commands, it's easier
and better to avoid problems by not defining
your own versions.

there are also quite a few "predefined"
2-letter commands, but most of them are
better known (by a u.s. audience) than
the 1-letter commands, and not as often
redefined by packages.

 have a look at how your document class loads the toc, then emulate that 
using your own macro, loading your file instead. Please be aware that 
\tableofcontents initialtes the creating of the toc files, so that needs 
to be handled as well.

BTW I would think most of what you are asking for might be doable in the 
memoir class especially if your are using a master file and have the 
chapters in seperate files.

both may be out of code readability, if you do not know what \le looks 
like A \le B doesn't make much sence, but because a lot of symbols 
containing eq means 'something equals' most users will guess that \leq 
means less than.

The same goes for the short names for sets etc., I agree it is bad 
style, because one cannot understand the code unless you have read the 
preamble. I recommend my users to use naming such that the code actually 
makes sense without looking at the output.

For example in topology we often use the combination of = and ~ to 
indicate an isomorphism, but reading M \cong N does not make much sense, 
here I recommend to users that they define a new macro \isomorph equal 
to \cong and use this throughout. Some journal editors does not like 
this, but as long as it is consistent then it is easy to change.

Some users may use \Z for one thing, but their colleague use it for 
something different, which make cooperation difficult. Another problem 
with the very short names (one letter) if that they are often used for 
accents, which again
confuse users.

No, Barbara, \le and \leq are synonyms for the same symbol, see TeXbook p. 436/438, there: 
"Some symbols have alternate names that are so commonly used that plain TeX provides two or more equivalent control sequences."

\leqq from the amssymb package has a double horizontal rule.

I will give you a real example of what happened two weeks ago:

In a journal of the Soci?t? Math?matique de France there is the  
following convention: at the end of every paper there is the sentence  
"Article re?u le ??, accept? le ??" (meaning: paper received on  
(date), accepted on (other date)).

One author has innocently defined \c to be \mathbb{C} (or even  
\ensuremath{\mathbb{C}}, I don't remember).

Result: the sentence was scrambled since the ? or "re?u" internally  
calls the cedilla macro \c and this was the name the author gave to  
his new macro...

And this happened without even an error message...  :-|

urk.
correct.  thanks, uwe.

in the case of \le and \leq, both are
defined in plain.tex; the basic one is
\leq, and then  \let\le=\leq .
so this was don knuth's decision.

but here the right adjustment is not exact, as there are spurious
spaces, after the "Chapter" and after the "8". An easy cure is to write
always, invariably "#\unskip" instead of "#". Or you need to type e. g.
"Chapter\cr", but the "#\unskip" in the preamble seems to be more
practical, more fail-safe, gives more freedom to align the source text.

Thanks, that is it exactly!

For other newbies like me:
1) the " at " in the command names is replaced by the "@" symbol
2) the last three newcommands have an extra "}" needed at the end

Hello -

What Ubuntu text editor best accomodates TeX?  Is there one like WinEdt
which allows you to TeX your .tex file, view your .dvi file,  create a .pdf,
directly from within the editor?  Or is there a better way to work with TeX
from under Ubuntu?

I happily use Kile (also available through Ubuntu's package manager),
which is designed specifically for (La)TeX editing. Kile is made for
the KDE desktop; it should work with Gnome (which is the default
desktop if you're using Ubuntu, rather than Kubuntu), but someone else
might know of a TeX editor made with Gnome in mind.

TeXmaker:

http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/

it doesn't have a built-in DVI viewer, but TeX Live comes with Xdvi,  
and it uses the system default PDF viewer (Evince is *not* a good  
choice).

or Kile:

http://kile.sourceforge.net/

If you've never used it before it takes a little getting used to but it is
time well spent and will save you oodles of time in the end. And then once
you get used to using Emacs, you begin to realize how useful it is for just
about anything!

Did my posting really appear that way to you?
Let me check,  no it was in its original form when
it came back to me in the daily digest.
Your email reader, or perhaps isp mail server, has
some 'splainin to do.

I've got some 'splainin too..  Ooops.

juhu an Emacs thread .... 

just to make it clear. If you need an editor (IDE) for a single time like 
write your thesis and after that you will never write again a TeX-file, you 
might like to go with kile, texmaker, etc.

If you looking for a permanent solution and it is likely that you will use it 
again and again and again and maybe make it part of your professional workflow, 
it is worse to consider the use of Emacs.

As with all professional tools, it take you more time to come into but later 
the things you can do with it and the time you save highly pay back for the 
hard learning curve at the beginning.

Its like LaTeX vs. OpenOffice-Writer, or MS-Word
like a DSLR vs. a compact digital camera
like a Gimp or Photoshop vs. MS paint
etc., etc.

the nice part on emacs,,, if you ever come to a Programming language X or a 
computer task Y... it is likely that you can use emacs (which you know then 
already) for this task no need to learn another IDE.

AND!!!! yes there is another great editor VIM which aims similar goals like 
emacs but use a different approach,,, try both, judge which you like... don't 
follow the flame-wars....

Thanks. I had also just figured out this:

\newlength{\foo}
\settowidth{\foo}{CHAPTER}

\hbox to \hsize{\hfill
  \vbox{
    \hbox{CHAPTER}
    \hbox to\foo{\hfill 8\hfill}}}

You may insert lines in your toc file  by using \addtocontents... in your

\addtocontents{toc}{\protect\otherfont}

Subject: [texhax] An idea for finding good page breaks
Message-ID: <40e4e7e50905251703v40c4d3f1w90ec055c3ac445e2@mail.gmail.com>

I'm playing around with  typesetting a book of interviews (see .sig to
guess which one). It seems like I'll be using the memoir class. The
basic formatting of the Q&A exchanges is each time the speaker changes
we have a small vskip and an unindented paragraph starting with the
speaker's name and any subsequent paragraphs while the same speaker is
talking are indented normally. I.e. something like my ASCII art
representation below.

It occurred to me that given this format, that a maybe a good way to
help TeX find good page breaks would be to let the vskips before each
new speaker act sort of analogously to the interword spacing when
computing line breaks. I.e. all the vskips on a page should be the
same but they can differ from page to page as a way to help expand or
contract the text a bit to get good breaks.

So I have two questions:

  1. Is that at all a reasonable idea?
  2. Is there some easy way to implement it in TeX/LaTeX/memoir?

-Peter

ASCII art illustration:

  Interviewer: Stuff stuff stuff?

  Interviewee: More stuff blah blah blah.
  Another sentence.
     A new paragraph of text from the same
  speaker. Blah blah blah.

 Interviewer: Another question?

Emacs comes with decent LaTeX support "out of the box". But if you do
decide to try Emacs, you will almost certainly want to try the AUCTeX
package too, which provides much richer and far more powerful
TeX/LaTeX/Context editing modes for Emacs. It's probably fair to say the
majority of people who use Emacs for LaTeX editing use AUCTeX.

Ubuntu's Emacs package might come with AUCTeX already installed. If not,
it'll certainly be available as a separate package in Ubuntu.

It loses some characters --try `` texdoc fontspec '' and, if your  
default PDF viewer is Evince (Document Viewer), you'll see it. Xpdf  
works fine.

Message-ID: <40e4e7e50905252305q4bfd0363p654ae5c341774d9e@mail.gmail.com>

I've got these two definitions in a document I'm typesetting with the
memoir class:

  \makeevenhead{headings}{\headlinefont\llap{\thepage\hskip 6pt} \leftmark}{}{}
  \makeoddhead{headings}{}{}{\headlinefont\rightmark\rlap{\hskip 6pt\thepage}}

For some reason the even head ends up with the page number lapped out
correctly but then the rest of the heading gets moved down a bit so
it's not in line with the page head. If I fill in the center and right
parts of the even head they are in the same line as the \leftmark text
(i.e. a bit below the line of the page number.)

The odd head works fine with the rightmark in line with the
right-lapped page number.

Any ideas about what I'm doing wrong?

-Peter

So it seems that if I put an hbox around the whole left part of the
even heading like so:

  \makeevenhead{headings}{\hbox{\headlinefont\llap{\thepage\hskip 6pt}
\leftmark}}{}{}

then everything works the way I hoped. Why, however, I have no idea. I
would love to be edified if this is obvious to someone else.

Can this be used to combine subscripts in equations? I've tried but couldn't figure out how to ensure that the whole group would be in math mode and subscript.

The important question is: are these used in a place where it is
always safe to look at the next character or command?  Things can
get messy looking ahead to see an alignment separator (&).  If they
are safe in general, are they safe to take a macro argument?  That
means they are never used right before }, or certain other contexts.

Here is my suggestion.  Expand the next token and look for a consistent
command name.  (Yes, \@ifnextchar can test commands.)

\makeatletter

\newcommand\cwtag[1]{%
  \cwtag at start \let\cwtag at start\relax % start and locally disable restart
  \emph{#1}%
  \expandafter\cwtag at tail
}

\newcommand\cwtag at tail{%
\@ifnextchar\cwtag{\cwtag at join}{\cwtag at stop}%
}
\newcommand\cwtag at start{\begingroup (}
\newcommand\cwtag at join{,\ }
\newcommand\cwtag at stop{)\endgroup}

\makeatother

\newcommand\hyph{\cwtag{hyph.} %% hyphenated
\newcommand\var{\cwtag{var.} %% variation

Pass :-).  By the way, regarding your earlier "idea for finding good
page breaks", \vskip with the same glue does exactly what you want.
Suppose that each \vskip is of the form

	\vskip 2\baselineskip plus 1\baselineskip minus 1\baselineskip

then on each page, each will contribute at most [*] 3 \baselineskip
and at least 1 \baselineskip, all will contribute exactly the same
amount, but the amount contributed on page $n$ will be independent
of the amount contributed on page $m$.

Philip Taylor

[*] Actually it can contribute more, /in extremis/.

why don't do what I always do when something puzzles me, look in the 
code, you might not understand it all, but you will often get an idea as 
to why things work the way they do.

each og the three header components (left, center, right) sits in it own

Message-ID: <200905262235.n4QMZwH20588@f7.net>

    I'm playing around with  typesetting a book of interviews

Funny, me too :).  (http://tug.org/interviews in my case.)

    all the vskips on a page should be the same but they can differ from
    page to page as a way to help expand or contract the text a bit to
    get good breaks.

Certainly a good idea, and easy to do.  This is exactly what
stretchable/shrinkable glue does.  Vertical glue works just the same way
as horizontal (e.g., interword spaces), as Phil replied.

For the sake of example, my \question and \answer macros start
approximately like this:

\long\def\question{\penalty-1000\vskip6pt plus3pt minus3pt ...
\long\def\answer  {\penalty-100 \vskip3pt plus2pt minus2pt ...

(These are all primitives, not the Approved LaTeX Way, but it works fine
with LaTeX.)

The negative \penalty (bonus) tells TeX, hey, this is a pretty good
place to break -- of course it's much better to break before the
question than before the answer.  But, if the page break is not taken,
then insert some glue.  The exact values will of course depend on your
layout.

Hope this helps,
Karl

It's better to use an \mbox here and a LaTeX equivalent for
\llap{\thepage\hskip 6pt}.  Though it's often more convenient for
people who are more familiar with plain TeX than with LaTeX to use
plain TeX macros or primitives directly, it's quite dangerous though.

Especially boxes are critical.  The LaTeX boxes contain some hooks
used by the color package.  If you use plain TeX code instead, you
don't see any problems immediately, but it might bite you later.

Another issue is hyperref.  It re-defines plenty of LaTeX macros.  If
you use your own macros, you'll certainly lose some of hyperref's
functionality.

Thus, if you want to use plain TeX code in LaTeX, you have to know
a lot about LaTeX's internals.  But there are some things in LaTeX2e
which are very sophisticated and it doesn't make much fun to
reverse-engineer the source code.

 > \vskip 2\baselineskip plus 1\baselineskip minus 1\baselineskip

Hmm, I'm not sure whether it's worthwhile to invest too much time into
these things because too much stretching is not desirable.  The result
will be ugly.  I doubt that you can get good page breaks without
manual interaction.  At least if you are interested in pleasing
results.

Of course, it's desirable to avoid page breaks in paragraphs and to
keep a question and the associated answer on the same page.  But I
doubt that it's possible at all if you have good typography in mind.

  Reinhard

I don't know evince.  Is it based on Derek's xpdf library?

Though I usually prefer free software, my preferred PDF viewer is
still Adobe Reader.  Is there any program except Adobe Reader or
Acrobat which can display microtype.pdf or movie15.pdf properly?

Maybe you don't know what you are missing unless you tried a program
which supports layers, 3D, JavaScript, and so on.

Derek will certainly never support all this.  But there is a new
project called "GNU PDF".

   http://gnupdf.org

It's quite promising and I hope that they find enough qualified
volunteers.

Yup. That fixes it too. Though I still wonder why it's necessary--why
would the left side of the header be in vertical mode while the right

Do you (or anyone else here) happen to know the LaTeX equivalent then
for the \llap{...} foo above? Or even some memoir specific way to do
what I want (which is to have the page number out in the margin
followed by a title left justified with the textblock.)

I don't think so. It says

Document Viewer 2.26.1
Document Viewer.
Using poppler 0.10.5 (cairo)
? 1996-2007 The Evince authors
http://www.gnome.org/projects/evince

Now ---I just checked fontspec.pdf in

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/xelatex/fontspec/fontspec.pdf

with Evince, TeXworks' (just compiled from source) built-in PDF viewer  
and Xpdf. The first two show missing characters (for example, in page  
3). Xpdf shows the whole document OK.

On the Mac, Acrobat identifies the font of those missing characters as  
Osaka-Mono, and says it's embedded.

By the way, as far as I know TeXworks also uses Poppler.


Best,

Axel

Poppler is a derivative of Xpdf.  But obviously less reliable.

I like xpdf because it allows viewing using reversevidea, (light on

Hmmm. I must be screwing up something up. This is what I had which
works the way I want:

\makeevenhead{headings}{\leavevmode\headlinefont\llap{\pagenumberfont\thepage\hskip
6pt} \leftmark\hfill}{}{}

In this one I replace the \llap bit with your suggestion:

\makeevenhead{headings}{\leavevmode\headlinefont\makebox[0pt][l]{\pagenumberfont\thepage\hspace{6pt}}
\leftmark\hfill}{}{}

but the number doesn't stick out in the margin--it overlaps the \leftmark text.

Subject: [texhax] Taking apart text of macro argument
Message-ID: <40e4e7e50905271613o3f841881m2a75ff158e861c6b@mail.gmail.com>

Suppose I have a macro that takes one argument:

\def\foo#1{...}

but within the expansion I want to pull off the first character (so I
can uppercase it) and the rest of the text (so I can lowercase it).

I.e. I want to be able to say:

    \foo{Some thing With Mixed Case}

and have it turn into:

    Some thing with mixed case

Is there any way to do that in either Plain TeX or LaTeX? (I actually
need this case manipulation so if there's an easy way to do that,
cool. I'd also be interested in the more general question of how to
take apart the text of the argument.)

-Peter

I realize I could do something like:

    \def\foo#1#2\par

but then I can't say \foo{...}

Hi, 
I'm fixing a patent that was originally formatted in LaTeX. I'm using numberpar.sty to 
number the paragraphs. My problem is that the patent office wants the numbers to 
be 001 002 etc instead of 1 2 ... How can I convince LaTex to use leading zeros in 
the numbers? 

Thanks!

but \foo could then call an adjunct macro (say, \foohelper),
using a delimited parameter structure :

\def \foohelper #1#2\relax {...}
\def \foo #1{\foohelper #1\relax}

the kernal has a macro called \two at digits which provides 01 02 etc, just 
make your own inspired from this. It is defined as

\def\two at digits#1{\ifnum#1<10 0\fi\number#1}

because it was mentioned ealier that the test file displays correctly in

Okular, the KDE PDF reader, can. It supports several additional colour 
changing options too (e.g., convert all light colours to colour 1 and 
all dark colours to colour 2).

Dear All,

Imagine that I have a LaTeX file something like the one appended
below.  Also imagine that (at least on some runs) I don't want the
appendix to appear in the DVI (or postscript, or PDF, or whatever)
output.  Or, even better, for the appendix to appear in a separate PDF
or postscript file from the main body of the document.  But I do still
want the two \ref{}s to work.  Is there some way to do this, please?

(So far, I've been chopping up the finished output with pstops - but
now the publisher needs the LaTeX source, and I'm not sure I can rely
on them having access to pstops.)

Thanks,

Dan

FYI okular also relies on poppler, and also fails on that test file.

I was going to file a bug report to that effect, but I see that
bugs.kde.org have an expired certificate. When they fix that, I'll file the
report against okular (and they'll move it upstream to poppler, and I would
expect the poppler folk to fix it pretty quickly; they seem pretty good at
fixing reported bugs). In danger of getting OT here though (if it isn't
already).

I should say that was under Ubuntu 9.04 and TeXLive 08.

Now ---this is weird--- I just checked under Fedora 10 with TeXLive  
07, and

/usr/share/texmf/doc/xelatex/fontspec/fontspec.pdf

doesn't show missing characters with Evince:

The subscript designator (_) is not usually a macro, so
it isn't redefined.  If you make it an active character
with a macro definition, then sure, you would look ahead
for another _ character (but no need for \expandafter).

What are you trying to achieve?  I don't understand that
second sentence at all.  I would think you would need
to look beyond intervening superscripts.

By the way, ' (apostrophe) has a definition in math
that does ^{\prime} but it looks ahead for another '
and combines them to give ^{\prime\prime}.  Maybe
you just want to copy that definition.

Thanks Uwe.  xr did the trick - I didn't need the continuous page

Hi,

Is there a simple way to put some additional text in an index, after the 
heading but before the index entries?
I use xindy (Swedish) and one way of doing it is to put an extra 
\lettergroup{} in the .ind file but this means that it has to be done 
after the index entries are sorted and hence every time a new index in 
generated.

For example, p. 3:

                    [...] for installing
fonts (    ,    ,     , ...) and provides

which are, .tfm .vf .map

But, as I said, in a later message, that is with Ubuntu 9.04 and

A little off-topic but I hope people don't mind.

I've just taken a close look at my university's regs and it appears that 
we still require students to submit their MSc or PhD theses 
double-spaced and single-sided.  I was wondering if more enlightened 
institutions have progressed to the stage where students can submit 
single-spaced and double-sided.

If you have regs that are less wasteful (especially if you're at a UK 
institution), could you drop me an email saying so?  I'll use it as 
evidence to help drag us towards the 21st century -- and maybe save some 
trees -- and update the LaTeX style that many of our students use.

Many thanks in advance.

Sorry I should have read it again before clicking send. Going back to the OP he wanted to achieve:

\hyph\var -> (hyph., var)Using the same definition for \hyph and \var, I was wondering if it was possible to achieve this:

\hyph\var -> $_{hyph., var}$ i.e. to combine the two and make them subscript at the same time whether they are already in a math environment or not.

Thanks for the tip with the apostrophe though. It gave me an idea for something else I needed to do.

The subscript designator (_) is not usually a macro, so
it isn't redefined.  If you make it an active character
with a macro definition, then sure, you would look ahead
for another _ character (but no need for \expandafter).

What are you trying to achieve?  I don't understand that
second sentence at all.  I would think you would need
to look beyond intervening superscripts.

By the way, ' (apostrophe) has a definition in math
that does ^{\prime} but it looks ahead for another '
and combines them to give ^{\prime\prime}.  Maybe
you just want to copy that definition.

Well I am not in the UK, but here in the US most institutions still want doublespacing. The reason is that (IIRC) proquest wants them that way and because they no longer print them but store them only electronically. As a result there is no pressure to save paper (not that there ever was). I've included some of the exceptions I know of below. 

Princeton allows singlespace but not doublesided:
http://www.princeton.edu/~mudd/thesis/DissertationRequirements.pdf

UTexas allows onehalf and doublespacing but no singlespacing:
http://www.utexas.edu/ogs/pdn/pdf/dissformat.pdf

USF allows single, onehalf and doublespace:
http://www.grad.usf.edu/inc/linked-files/etd-booklet/handbook_step1_May2005.pdf

Georgia Tech allows onehalf for certain fonts:
http://www.gradadmiss.gatech.edu/thesis/ThesisManual-March2007.pdf

Btw I have yet to hear of a university that accepted a doublesided dissertation. 

Regards

d.

Not sure if this will work for you but you can define your own
makeindex style. One of the things you can define, is the output file
preamble where you can add the text you want. You can also define the
sort order for characters not in the english alphabet.

Check the
man page of makeindex for more details. Also there should be some
example style files (e.g. for german) with your distribution. If you
have texlive look under:
   texmf-dist/makeindex/

Sorry but I've never used xindy.

Hi,

Is there a simple way to put some additional text in an index, after the heading but before the index entries?
I use xindy (Swedish) and one way of doing it is to put an extra \lettergroup{} in the .ind file but this means that it has to be done after the index entries are sorted and hence every time a new index in generated..

In the memoir class (at least) there is a \preindexhook that you can
set with \renewcommand. I'm not sure whether that's specific to memoir
or not.

Sure.  LaTeX has \ensuremath.  I suspect it will not be simple to
use \ensuremath directly in the solution because it reads its
parameter text up front, but you can look at its definition.
For example, you could use 
 ...
 \ifmmode _\bgroup \else $_\bgroup \aftergroup$\fi

I don't know if this counts a simple or not, but this is what I figured out for LaTeX 2.09 about 1992 or so. The book was published, but we never converted it to 2e so YMMV.


%This block redefines \theindex to get some text at the beginning of the
%Index as in sample books, and put Index in the toc.
\def\theindex{\@restonecoltrue\if at twocolumn\@restonecolfalse\fi
\columnseprule \z@
\columnsep 35\p@\twocolumn[\@makeschapterhead{\indexname}
\small Boldface page numbers indicate that the item occurs on that page in
{\bf boldface}, Italic page numbers indicate occurrence in {\em Italics}. 
Terms being defined are usually in boldface in the text.
\bigskip\bigskip]%
\@mkboth{\uppercase{\indexname}}{\uppercase{\indexname}}%
    \thispagestyle{plain}\parindent\z@
    \parskip\z@ plus .3\p@\relax\let\item\@idxitem
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Index}}


All I did was copy the definition from latex.tex and determine by trial and error where and how to insert my text.

For me, a relative newcomer at the time, the harder part was figuring out how to write the macros to accomplish the desired indexing.

In the math department at Aarhus University, DK, we don't have any rules 
regarding the layout. Most PhDs handin their dissertations in A4 or B5, 
single spaced, doublepaged. I usually encourage them to treat it like a 
book, and make it nice to look at.

BTW: the dissertaions are all online.

When I submitted mine (Cambridge University Physics and Chemistry
Degree Committee, 2003), I used the standard LaTeX book document class
- which I guess you'd call somewhere between single-spaced and
double-spaced - and no-one complained about that.  I had printed it
single-sided.  I'm not sure about "less wasteful" - in those days, I
didn't know about \usepackage{fullpage}.

We wrote a small (unreleased) package, uitindex, to do exactly this.
See below for the code, and an example of how to use it.

This is the index to the book described at:
    http://uit.co.uk/altdns
You can view the index by clicking on the link in the "Resources"
box on the top right.

    Niall

Notes:

        1. This package changes index operation in two ways:
           a. You can customize the index font and appearance.
           b. You can add a ``blurb'' before the index proper, e.g. to
              explain your indexing font conventions, etc.
           If you don't want either of these features, don't use the
           package.

        2. This package uses \@makeschapterhead, so it works only with
           classes that define that (including book.cls, report.cls, ...).
           

Example usage:

        ...
        \usepackage{uitindex}
        ...

        % This is optional. This package uses a default setting for index
        % font, appearance etc., which applies to the index entries 
only, and
        % not the Chapter heading, blurb, etc. You can define your own 
setting
        % using \uitindexformattingdef.  The current value of the settings,
        % whatever they are, is available as \uitindexformatting, so you can
        % use this in your index blurb to give the blurb the same appearance
        % as the body of the index.
        \uitindexformattingdef{\bf}

        % This is optional -- defines ``blurb'' that goes between the
        % ``Index'' Chapter heading and the start of the 2-column index.

        \usepackage{uitindex}
        \uitindexblurb{
                %{\footnotesize First line}
                {\uitindexformatting

                In the index, many terms are marked with a small
                superscript (as in
                \sf{access-control}\textsuperscript{Unbound}, for
                example), to indicate the program or brand of server
                the item relates to, or in which chapter the term
                appears.  Page numbers in italics indicate where terms
                are defined.  Variable names (\eg \envnx{UID}) are
                sorted under their initial letter, not under ``\$''.


                \vspace{1.5cm}}
                }
        \makeindex

March 1991, I was allowed to submit a double sided PhD thesis at a UK 
institution (Cranfield Institute of Technology, subsequently rebadged as
Cranfield University).

I'm not sure that it saved any trees though, for if you can believe it, I 
did not have a screen previewer and so wasted no end of paper as I tweaked 
the text. In my defence, back then I had no e-mail, no internet 
connection, and so my options for self-improvement were limited.

If you do manage to go the two-sided route, beware of your book binder. I 
went to great lengths to ensure the visual quality of my thesis, even 
going so far as to write my own PostScript graphics library. I used my own 
home-brew LaTeX style-file that started all chapters on an odd page and 
where necessary inserted a blank page at the end of the previous chapter. 
Therefore you can imagine my shock when the thesis came back from the 
binders. Wherever there was a legitimate blank page, the binder inserted 
his own page with the message "pagination error" in one inch type. To say 
I was unhappy is an understatment: picture Munch's The Scream and you'll 
get an idea at how disconsolate I was.

Anyhow enough of my ramblings, and BOB with your write-up. 

James
