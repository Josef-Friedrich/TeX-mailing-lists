Subject: [texhax] home texmf dir not searched
Message-ID: <ha2mck$6c0$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hi all,

I have found the latex installed on my Fedora Core 11 machine (TeXLive) 
somehow stopped searching my home texmf dir, (as default at ~/texmf as 
stated in the /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf file. It was working okay 
until recently and I have not modified the cnf file for some time.

Maybe a bug of an update --the system's kept updated? I'm using TeXLive. 
If anybody has the same problem and/or has a possible solution please 
advise.

Yo

Message-ID: <6480DF5B-4368-4176-99F8-F8D3936A84F6@gmail.com>

I am using the memoir package to try and typeset some poems, and I am  
running into a slight problem. I am using the verse environment with  
the \versewidth command to center the poem. I would like to have the  
title of the poem flush with the body of the poem. How would I do this?

This is where I am currently stuck in the code:

\documentclass[12pt,oneside]{memoir}

\pagestyle{plain}
\chapterstyle{dash}
\renewcommand{\PoemTitlefont}{%
\normalfont\sffamily\hspace{\vleftmargin}} %Remove centering from the  
poem title

\begin{document}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{this is a pretty long line in my poem}
\PlainPoemTitle
\PoemTitle{My Great Poem Title}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

this is the body of my poem\\
and its pretty bad\\
please help me with my problem\\
and i will be quite glad\\
and: his is a pretty long line in my poem\\
\end{verse}
\newpage

\end{document}

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I've been working on this for a  
few days with no results.

Best,
Mica

Alternatively, you can use showexpl package. Also you cant try bidicode
package which is a part of bidi system (bidirectional typesetting for PDFTeX
and XeTeX).

Dear Mica - 

I'm using {article}, not {memoir}, but here's the brute force solution I've found - 
retain centering for titles, then adjusting for flushleft by using \hspace with 
negative values.   

If there's a more elegant approach, I'd also be grateful to know more.  The  
Muses are particularly mysterious when they speak verse in LaTeX.

Rebecca

\begin{verse}
\begin{center}
\hspace{-2in} Stanza II.\verselinebreak
\end{center}

To left-justify verse apace\\
You can subtract hspace\verselinebreak

\end{verse}

Hello,
you go to displayed (and centered) math directly after the item 
command (which does not need a {}), which will IMHO not be written at 
the same height as the item symbol, but below.  Further you want the 
hsize bigger than normal. I would think that your not augmented  
hsize might yet be the same as the original \textwidth (augment  
\linewidth, if that  is tolerated), so to make it bigger gives an 
impossible wide vbox.

I would try the following:

\item $\displaystyle ... $
or even
\item \hfil $\displaystyle   ...$ to center it on the available 
horizontal space.

Message-ID: <cf09ac7f0910042320g5e249127w3bd5a2787245da28@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I want to know how to create split emacs screen for real time Latex ouput,
which is something like this:

http://www.emacswiki.org/pics/static/LaTeXMathPreviewScreenshot.png

I tried:
Auctex - this one using internal output
Whizzytex- this use ADVI output
Yatex - plan to use latex-math-preview (using default install in Ubuntu
apt-get install yatex), but can't managed to get it work.

Can you guys lead me? I saw my friend did that years back, but I am not sure
whether current emacs support that.

Also can emacs with -nw flag append that in it's screen? Since currently I'm
using plain console.

Muhammad,

I serious doubt that emacs on a console can do what you want.  However, if you can find an appropriate console DVI viewer you might be able to use screen(1) to run emacs in one console and the DVI view in another.

Disclaimer:  In my 5 minute search I was not able to find much good about graphics on a Linux console.  (It's possible.  Mplayer can do it.  But it's not common and it may be disruptive.)

Message-ID: <EBB54A9A-D507-4CFF-9C65-CF6822591B72@gmail.com>

I am using a latex class file called euproposal.cls (from here http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/euproposal/) 
  to prepare a research proposal for the EC.
I am very happy with this latex class except that it generates  
"workpackage" tables where the list of "participants" goes off the  
page (cf image here: http://thirlmere.aston.ac.uk/~kiffer/docs/Euproposal_workpackage_problem.pdf)

I have contacted the author but received no response (no reproach to  
him).
I do not know how to edit the package file to change this behaviour or  
even if it is possible.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
By the way, a "minimal example" is hard to provide here because it is  
an extremely complex and sophisticated package.
I would be happy to provide it off line.

Thank you,

Hello Lewan,

I can't find DVI reader embedded in console (although I think it's cool),
since currently DVI/ADVI fire up their own windows.

This is a little misleading: both \newenvironment\paragraph{...}{...} and
\renewenvironment\paragraph{...}{...} will throw up an error: The command
\paragraph is already defined but is not an environment.  The poster will
have to use a different name, e.g.,

\newenvironment\myparagraph{...}{...} 

Cheers,  Phil

Really? I just tried \renewenvironment{paragraph}{foo}{bar} and it
happily defines the new paragraph environment (redefining the \paragraph
command behind the scenes, with no complaints).

Hello Muhammad: You will NOT find anything of sorts (dvi previewer on  
terminal). The graphic reference you have shared with us is, simply,  
emacs+preview which, BTW, both run over a Xserver or windows or  
whatever other OS with a Window Manager, so it not possible to produce  
that example from a simple "terminal" as you surmised. Now, if you are  
into emacs, I suggest you download the latest version and then byte  
compile the preview package with auctex.

Trying now, for the first time.

Choosing the "Rsync" method, I am advised to :

	rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex* 
rsync://somehost/some/path/ /your/local/dir

which using the information in :

	http://tug.org/texlive/mirmon/

and finding no UK mirror, I map to

	rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exc
lude=mactex* rsync://guiling.fr/texlive/ h:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror

whereupon I am told :

	The source and destination cannot both be remote.
rsync error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at 
/home/lapo/packaging/rsync-3.0.4-
1/src/rsync-3.0.4/main.c(1136) [receiver=3.0.4]

The error message is invariant with the direction of slashes
in "h:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror"

Suggestions, please ?
** Phil.

No complaints only because you did not put it through tests. With \re...
you circumvented exactly the tests the others ran into. But your code will
break a lot of existing examples -- anything using the standard \paragraph
syntax. Probably without any helpful error messages -- TeX will just be
missing \end's. It's much safer to give it a unique name as it differs
quite a bit from the standard \paragraph.

This is the Synametrics port of Rsync, supplied
as a part of their DeltaCopy package, and as used

OK, some people know how to \renewenvironment{paragraph}, but what is it 
good for?

I rather guess that wawan wants that each paragraph starts with some 
<start> end ends with some <end>, so he types

     Hello world!

and gets

     <start>Hello world!<end>

However, to achieve this by some \renewenvironment{paragraph} is sort of 
voodoo thinking. Rather (a sketch only)

     \everypar{<start>}
     \let\formerpar\par \def\par{<end>\formerpar}

This is just a sketch in particular because it is not very compatible with 
LaTeX's use of \everypar and \par. Sorry, I am in a hurry ...

Because so far there is no evidence to suggest that
this behaviour is an artifact of the Synametrics port.

(cont).

As a work-around, I change directory to H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror
and replace the final element of the previous "Rsync" incantation
with "."  Rsync is then prepared to do something, but immediately
reports :

What are "non-regular" files, please ?

You're probably right that giving it a new name is safer. I was just
pointing out that the statement:

>>> [...] both \newenvironment\paragraph{...}{...}
>>> and \renewenvironment\paragraph{...}{...} will throw up an error:

was not quite correct. The latter does not throw up an error, so it's
perfectly *possible* to define a "paragraph" environment to supplant the
\paragraph command. Whether it's desirable or not, I leave up to the
original questioner!

Now I've sussed it out, at least using the Cygwin rsync:

rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex*

Okay, I tried this with rsync linked against Cygwin, and got the same
result. I think the issue is the ":" specifying the drive, as it *does*
work if I do:

rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex*
rsync://guiling.fr/texlive/ /temp/texlive

However, that doesn't go from C:\, but from the current directory. I
guess this is a rsync think: not really related to TeX Live at all.

(I should add that I've had no issues on Windows just downloading the
installer via http then letting it "do its thing".)

Can you give us a clue as to your rsync program? On Windows, I only know
of it being available as part of cygwin.

Vladimir Volovich has kindly identified the root cause of
the problem :

> syntax of the destination starting with h: tells rsync that it is a
> remote host names "h" (that's how rsync over ssh is used).

Vladimir recommended making H: the default drive and
then using a simplified path, but that seemed a little
kludgy to me (even 'though I am currently doing exactly
that, so as to make progress), so after a little thought
and experiment I am pleased to be able to report that it
is not strictly necessary.  In fact, one can use a UNC
for the destination, with the proviso that the slashes
must be forward slashes, and therefore the following is
a solution.

rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex* 
rsync://guiling.fr/texlive/ //<localhost>/<localpath>

e.g.,

rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex* 
rsync://guiling.fr/texlive/ //RV-5/H$/TeX/Live/2009/Mirror

It would, IMHO, be worth documenting this
lest any other Windows users fall into this trap.

Without looking at the source directory I cannot tell for sure, but I  
suppose they are symbolic links[0].

OK, that stage is now complete.  The next stage is installing, for
which the web page says :

Now there are a couple of problems here.

1) Unless the location to which I mirrored the installation
kit is already in my path, "Install-tl[.bat]" won't be found.

2) the <location> option, if I have elected to Rsync the
entire installation kit, is presumably /not/ a link target
on the TeX Live pre-test mir-mon page, but rather the location
on my local system to which I have performed the mirroring.

So, assuming that the above assumptions were correct, I did
the following :

1) Set default to the location to which I had mirrored the
installation kit :

	H:
	CD H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror

2) Typed "Install-TL -location . -gui perltk"

Unfortunately it then reported "Access denied" :

> PATH=H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror\tlpkg\tlperl\bin;E:\Layered products\ActiveState\PE
> RL\site\bin;E:\Layered products\ActiveState\PERL\bin;K:\WINXPPRO\system32;K:\WIN

> ON~1\SONICS~1\;E:\Layered products\Synametrics Technologies\DeltaCopy
> Access is denied.
> Press any key to continue . . .

These same symptoms can consistently be replicated by
iteratively stripping trailing elements from the
incantation, leaving (at end) just "Install-TL"
(or "Install-TL.bat"), and also with ".\Install-TL[.bat]".

Any new suggestions, please ?

You need to cd to this directory, or open the folder in explorer and
double-click the file here. I thought windows users were used to do that.

Hi Phil,
I assume that you don't want to type this on the command line each
time you want to update.

A more convenient solution is to write a batch file.

------------------------------------------------------------------
@echo off

cd c:\some\directory

rsync -r --delete --exclude=2008 --exclude=mactex* rsync://guiling.fr/texlive/ ./relative/path/to/target/dir
------------------------------------------------------------------

Because you first "cd" to a particular directory, you can use relative
paths in order to avoid the colon in the rsync argument list.

I think that we should acknowledge that there is a Windows port at
all.  rsync was written for Unix.  Porting it to Windows is a pain
because Windows is not POSIX compliant.

Why haven't you contacted Synametrics? It seems that their rsync is either 
buggy or needs another syntax.

Agreed, but (a) I don't like batch files (they replace
thought with action : rarely a good idea, IMHO !), and
(b) my point was rather that the present documentation
is inadequate, not to say seriously misleading, for
any na\i ve Windows user wishing to help with the testing
of TL 2009.  Once I can get to the point of being able
to test myself (I am still stuck at the point of "Access
is denied"), I will be more than happy to offer better
documentation which takes the needs of Windows' users
properly into account.

In the meantime, I have implemented a Windows' shortcut
which performs the Rsynching, taking advantage of the
fact that Windows' shortcuts support the concept of
a "Start-in" directory.  I have also added the "--progress"
qualifier so as to gain a better insight into what
exactly is happening.

Further to this, and with brain in more appropriate gear
(the last two days have been beset with hardware failures,
which tend to drive out rational thought), I have modified
"Install-TL.bat" to commence "@Echo on" rather than
"@Echo off" as supplied, and can now report that the
problem appears to result from the first attempt to
launch PERL :

I'd imagine that most Windows users will take my approach: download the
stand-alone installer and user that. rsync is already quite "odd" for
Windows people, I'd say. However, you're right that the documentation
should at least try to give useful advice!

A further check shews that it is PERL that is the problem
rather than "H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror\install-tl", since
just "H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror>perl" is sufficient to
trigger the "Access is denied" message.  Setting default
to that directory and attempting to run PERL from there
produces exactly the same symptoms.

Acting on instinct, I deleted "perl.exe.manifest"
from H:\TeX\Live\2009\Mirror\tlpkg\tlperl\bin;
TeX Live PERL now runs, for the first time :-)

Sadly, we are by no means out of the water.  The
installation now aborts as follows (echo remains enabled) :

Subject: [texhax] memoir package, \begin{verse}[\versewidth], poem title

I am using the memoir package to try and typeset some poems, and I am running
into a slight problem. I am using the verse environment with the \versewidth
command to center the poem. I would like to have the title of the poem flush
with the body of the poem. How would I do this?

This is where I am currently stuck in the code:

\documentclass[12pt,oneside]{memoir}

\pagestyle{plain}
\chapterstyle{dash}
\renewcommand{\PoemTitlefont}{%
\normalfont\sffamily\hspace{\vleftmargin}} %Remove centering from the poem title

\begin{document}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{this is a pretty long line in my poem}
\PlainPoemTitle
\PoemTitle{My Great Poem Title}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

this is the body of my poem\\
and its pretty bad\\
please help me with my problem\\
and i will be quite glad\\
and: his is a pretty long line in my poem\\
\end{verse}
\newpage

\end{document}

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I've been working on this for a few days
with no results.

Best,
Mica

Hi Mica,

If I understand your question correctly, I would just change the
redefinition of \PoemTitlefont in your example to the following:

\renewcommand{\PoemTitlefont}{%
\normalfont\sffamily\flushleft% Remove centering from poem title
\hspace*{0.5\linewidth}\hspace*{-0.5\versewidth}}

Best, Samuel

Why don't you do:

	install-tl ...

or
	h:\tex\live\2009\mirror\install-tl.bat ...

BTW, what is that -local . an argument for? It is AFAIR not an argument

The "-local" appears to be a typo (I haven't checked the original)
but in reality it reads "-location .", since the pre-test documentation
states that a <location> must be given, and gives the syntax of
a <location> as "-location <local-or-remote-path>".

OK, but these are not mentioned at all at

which is the only documentation to which
potential pre-testers are referred ...

I agree.

Well, though improved documentation can never hurt, I'd like to point out that
pretesting, and especially using the rsync approach, is not really meant for the
"typical" user.

I cannot be sure that there was never a time when
I typed "local" as a Freudian slip for "location",
but I have just repeated the test (manifest file
deleted, echo on) with this incantation :

Message-ID: <4ACC7962.8050900@jth.hj.se>

Hi.

I'm using a roman font, where I want the bold weight to use the 
semi-bold font. But I want the sans serif bold to use its regular bold! 
Is there an easy way?

Currently I use:
\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{mbv} % A Baskerville as rm
\renewcommand{\bfdefault}{sb}  % Use semibold instead of bold
\usepackage{helvet}            % Helvetica as sf

This causes the roman to be semibold and the sans serif be neither bold 
nor semi-bold. Is there a "\bfdefault_for_rm_only"?

Yes, it's not TeX Live specific, but it would be very nice to have
this information on the rsync-for-Windows download page.  Maybe
someone is willing to contact Synametrics in order to make such a
suggestion...

No, but you can add substituation rules for helvet so that it use b
when sb is called:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc}										
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}													
\usepackage{helvet}		

\renewcommand{\bfdefault}{sb}  
\sffamily\selectfont%to load t1phv.fd
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{phv}{sb}{n}{<->ssub * phv/b/n}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{phv}{sb}{sc}{<->ssub * phv/b/sc}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{phv}{sb}{sl}{<->ssub * phv/b/sl}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{phv}{sb}{it}{<->ssub * phv/b/it}{}

%etc for other encodings like TS1

\begin{document}
abc \sffamily abc \bfseries abc
\end{document}



You can naturally also generate local fd-file for phv and add the
rules there.

In LaTeX, \pounds or \textsterling should do the trick. (In Plain TeX,  
the pound symbol is in the italic $ slot.)

Try looking at the "laspage" package.

Subject: [texhax] Unexpected behaviour with spacing in moderncv class
Message-ID: <70732fb40910090308s15205de8la09a9722be46b85f@mail.gmail.com>

When using the moderncv class, the resulting pdf has an unexpectedly
large gap underneath the very first section heading.

It only happens when \quote is not defined.  It seems to happen
depending on whether or not I leave an empty space between the
\maketitle command and the very first \section command.  If I do not
leave an empty space between the two, there is an (ugly) large gap
between the first section heading and the cvline underneath it.  If
there is an empty space between \maketitle command and the first
\section command, it looks fine.

To illustrate exactly what I mean, I have attached four latex files
and the four resulting pdfs, with all possible combinations of (1) a
blank space or no blank space between \maketitle and \section, and (2)
\quote being defined or undefined.

Am I naive for expecting that these will all come out the same, and
not realizing there may be differences?  Or is this a problem with the
moderncv class?

The original subject (disguised by hh) was "renewenviroment paragraph", so 
why \newenvironment? (I answered under the original subject.)

Which examples? Who uses LaTeX's \paragraph?

After \newenvironment{paragraph}{...}{...}, \endparagraph is defined, so what?

However, I guessed that all of this is irrelevant since the OP seemed to 
have the mislead idea that \renewcommand{paragraph}{...}{...} changed the 
appearance of paragraphs.

In the ledmac package, for \article, I need a modification to allow two sets of 
page numbers.  

The simple fix is two counters running at once.  Is there a way to tweak 

\setcounter{page}{startnumbering} 

to add another counter?


Any reasonable format is fine, like 79(200) (at the bottom of the page).  The 
second set of page numbers can also appear elsewhere on the page (upper 
right).

With thanks as always,

Rebecca

Hi
I'm inserting dates in a table in the month abbrev date[st|nd|th] 
format, e.g. Oct. 9th.
Question is, is there a macro for presenting date in above format?
Is there one for presenting date in the day/month/year, e.g. 09/10/09 format?
I suppose what I'm really asking is what visual difference these 
macros would make to the date string.
Any pointers would be most appreciated.

Message-ID: <8E19C8E4-E860-40D9-A9F8-568BD3B11BD1@gmail.com>

Hello community,

I'm working with the package glossaries

\usepackage[style=altlist,order=letter]{glossaries}

and I don't know how to solve a minor problem. Some of the glossary  
terms are referenced to an internet site:

\newglossaryentry{Python}{
   name=\href{http://www.python.org/}{Python},
   description={\LDPython},
   text={Python}}

and when I create the glossaries, the ordering is not the one I would  
like. I would like the term "Python" to be ordered by the letter P,  
but (I suppose) it takes the first characters of "name", in this case  
"\", for the ordering and all terms that contain the "\href" on the  
name are ordered first. Some ideas of how could I solve this?

Many thanks for your time and help,

a

create somewhere (outside miktex) a folder "whateveryouwant-texmf"
with a small TDS substructure (e.g. a subfolder tex), then add
"whateveryouwant-texmf" as a new root in miktex settings. You can
then fill this texmf-tree with your files. 

Attention if you have a multi user setup: starting with 2.8. such
roots can be set up also on a per-user basis and the maintenance
tools exist as "user" variant and as "admin" variant. So you will
have to test a bit to find out how to update the fndb of your new
root.

The datetime package provides various date formats, and you can define 
your own format if none of the predefined ones are appropriate. The 
current date is, as usual, produced with \today, but it follows the same 
format as \formatdate{day}{month}{year} which is used to format a 
specific date. For example:

\ddmmyyyydate
\today.
\formatdate{9}{10}{2009}.

would produce:
10/10/2009. 09/10/2009.

One of my colleagues wants to use [framed]{ntheorem} albeit does not
like behavior of framedtheorem braking pages: then each portion is in
framebox. Instead he wants that in this case the horizontal rules on
the bottom of the first page and on the top of the second page
disappear.

Is any implementation of this? Alternatively, how to make a
framedtheorem with only vertical rules ?

Thank you in advance

Hi
Is it possible to format time via the datetime package, similar to 
\formatdate{d}{m}{y}?
Thanks,

There isn't a time equivalent to \formatdate at the moment. I'll add 
something into the next version.

are you sure? because dcolumn works in mathmode, thus it is using the 
math font instead not the text font. It might be a limitation of 
dcolumn, so I'd recommend that you had a look at the siunitx package, 
which apart from providing unit, also provides a feature similar to 
dcolumn but much more configurable, and I think I saw a section in the 
manual that solved your problem.

Subject: [texhax] Specifying baseline-to-baseline skip in TeX
In-Reply-To: <499426B2.5020706@open.ac.uk>
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20091011103350.02453140@pop3.web.de>

While Jonathan (below) addressed baseline-to-baseline skips on /title 
pages/, I am encountering the same problem with /sectioning/:

The /designer/ has specified the skip from the last \chapter baseline to 
the next baseline. A simple \vskip(glue) closing the chapter macros [apart 
from \@afterheading] would result in a baseline-to-baseline distance of 
(glue)+(b) where (b) is the \baselineskip associated with either 
\normalsize or \section, I don't know ... [with ordinary text in adjacent 
lines only; I am using round parentheses for meta-variables here because I 
know that some HTML-mail-program likes to suppress the more natural ASCII 
imitation of angle brackets].

I am thinking of A. redefining [the /next/] \section so it makes up for the 
difference of the \normalsize and \section \baselineskip's and tweaking of 
\everypar to get back the usual behaviour of \section when \chapter is 
/not/ immediately followed by \section; B. asking the designer to specify 
/white space/ instead of baseline-to-baseline skip instead [which may 
matter more anyway from a visual point of view, \nointerlineskip \vkip..., 
not sure about descenders].

For a general solution, font size switches [at least for \large etc.] might 
be redefined to replace an earlier vertical \lastskip by \lastskip-(b) 
where (b) is the \baselineskip associated with the font size [assuming font 
switches occur at starting paragraphs only; storing \lastskip and 
substracting \baselineskip, \nobreak\vskip-\lastskip etc.; bad if section 
number font size is different to that of title].

Or one could use such variants of font size switches [\large*, ...; 
\fontsize*] on title pages and in sectioning definitions.

Subject: [texhax] xargs / lstlistings quoting of arguments
Message-ID: <4AD02D2D.4010901@liddicott.com>

(notangle and noweave are literate programming tools.)

I'm just finishing a re-write of notangle in awk and noweave in latex.
Interested parties can see git tree at http://repo.or.cz/w/newfangle.git
(I use Lyx as my authoring tool).

I have some difficulties with advanced escaping and arguments.

Another chunk may be referred to with this command, with optional
arguments passed as chunk parameters - a bit like C macros.

\chunkref{chunkname}[optional, arguments, here]

I'm having some trouble with arguments to a chunk, when the arguments
might contain and underscore or a back-slash

I'm using the listings package \lst at ReplaceIn\chunk\lst at filenamerpl 
whose purpose is to escape out certain special characters, and that 
works fine enough except in some complex cases I'll describe.

If I want to pass an array element as a chunk parameter I might have
some code that looks like this:

\begin{lstlistings}
   int s_int[10];
   x=3;
   \chunkref{do_something}[s_int[x]]
\end{lstlistings}

\lst at ReplaceIn will fixup the _ in s_int for me.

of couse the ] in [x] will close the xargs optional argument, so instead
I can do:
   \chunkref{do_something}[{s_int[x]}]
which works fine, and if I have a second parameter I would do:
   \chunkref{do_something_more}[{s_int[x], y}]
which works fine too at the moment.

but then image it is a 2D array;
   \chunkref{do_something_more}[{s_int[x, 2], y}]

the , in [x, 2] would technically signify the start of the second
parameter, so I could enclose each argument in { }
   \chunkref{do_something_more}[{s_int[x, 2]}, {y}]

but either xargs cat codes or listings \lst at ReplaceIn chokes on any { }
which don't enclose the whole argument, and so the underscore in s_int
is not escaped any more.

I attach a minimal sample file newfangle.txt which show how additional
inner braces prevent the escaping of enclosed underscores and other
characters.

I suppose I am inviting discussion on these aspects:
1. how I might properly escape inner underscores (and backslashes, etc)

2. why I'm trying to let the author type (almost) plain C in the middle
of a latex document anyway (but thats what lstlistings lets you do)

3. if there are better methods to present parameterised code chunks
-   one idea that appeals to me is to take the xargs optional argument
which is all the parameters and then apply that to a function which is
looking for comma separated arguments and will eat any { } (providing
xargs hasn't changed the cat-code).

Maybe I should not call \lst at ReplaceIn on the entire xargs argument 
(which is multiple chunk arguments) but first split it into multiple 
arguments with a recursive function that looks for arguments ending in a 
comma, and then apply \lst at ReplaceIn on each one... it will take me all 
morning but I'll try it.
I've read Knuths ("you can't pdf it") tex book and the other one and 
blown my brain a few times, but I still don't have the answers.

I'll be glad for any enlightenment that helps me on my way.

Herbert Voss's "Math mode", available from CTAN in pdf and
in tex form, is "A comprehensive review of mathematics in
(La)TeX".  You can get it here:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/math/voss/mathmode/

You can also find online pdf excerpts of the first edition
of George Gratzer's book "Math into LaTeX" (1995):

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/mil/

Should you be interested in the book, note that there is a
4th edition, called "More math into LaTeX", published 2007.

Hope this helps.

Now, I manually changed the line from \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} to
\usepackage{inputenc}, and the problem seems revoled, I feel
everything is fine!   Just wondering: why after removed all 'utf-8' in
the Doxygen configuration file, it still generate the tex file with

It doesn't make much sense to use inputenc without any option. Use
\usepackage["Encoding"]{inputenc], where "encoding" is the name of
encoding you are using.

Btw: You input and include a lot of files. Make sure that they all
use the same encoding or change with \inputencoding{...) the
encoding before loading them.

Sorry about the cross post but since I am attempting to compile the  
Unix source...

Has anyone managed to compile a working binary of rtf2latex2e on Snow  
Leopard?

After much messing about I was finally stopped by this (from  
config.log):

configure:2747: gcc    conftest.c  >&5
ld: library not found for -lcrt1.10.6.o
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
configure:2750: $? = 1

DVIPS doesn't make use of PPDs AFAIK.

If your PostScript isn't conforming to the specifications, your best  
option would be to add some additional steps:

  - open the .pdf in Adobe Acrobat
  - set Acrobat to use the .ppd in question
  - save (or print) to a PostScript file
  - distill w/ Acrobat Distiller

For my part, I've always found that the features which the Prinergy  
PPD affords are matched by the configurability of DVIPS and have had  
no need for it w/ the workflow you describe.

Thanks for your mail! Maths-escape is ok for the number, but I would 
have to insert the space between number and NH3 manually. And it would 
not work when using the \ce- command within an equation environment for 
predefined reaction equations. But maybe I just use text mode with the 
version you suggested.

The descenders of large-font chapter and section titles 
screw up surrounding \baselineskips, often causing \lineskip
to be used.  

You can get a specific ad-hoc baseline-skip between paragraphs
using something like:

\newdimen\prevdepthcalc

\def\blskipper#1{\par
\prevdepthcalc=\prevdepth
\advance\prevdepthcalc -#1\relax
\advance\prevdepthcalc\baselineskip
\advance\prevdepthcalc\parskip
\ifdim\prevdepthcalc<-99pt
  \vskip-99pt
  \vskip-\prevdepthcalc
  \prevdepthcalc=-99pt
\fi
\prevdepth=\prevdepthcalc
}

It has to have the \baselineskip for the following 
paragrah already set, but that is not possible in general
(the paragraph could end like {\small\par}). If you
want to delay operation until \everypar, then you 
will have to back out of the paragraph, do \blskipper,
and re-start the paragraph.  That goes roughly like:

\begingroup
  \everypar{}%
  \setbox\@tempboxa\lastbox
  \@@par
  \vskip-\parskip
  \blskipper{xxxxpt}%
  \ifvoid\@tempboxa \noindent \else \indent \fi
\endgroup

But you have to make sure this gets executed *first*, before
whatever other code is executed by \everypar.

If you are worried about the positioning below chapter
heads with [twocolumn] you are out of luck.  See bug
report latex/3126.

Try this:

Don't TeX's kerning tables usually do a better job than this.  $HW=W\!H$ 
looks much better and it might even be better to add another -1mu of

I agree with \!, but \! \mkern -1 mu looks far too tight to me.

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc}
% correct fuer Windows-OS 
\usepackage{txfonts}

But even 'ansinew' a have seen seldom enough.
And I had never any problem with transforming ps to pdf.

Well, that's the kerning for the math italic font.  You might be
tempted to use text italic font:

    ${\it HW} = {\it WH}$

but then you'd have to watch out for ligatures:

    $coefficient$

    $\it coefficient$

If this is a product of c, o, e, ..., n, t, then the ligatures are
inappropriate; but if it is a multi-letter identifier/variable name,
then \it is the way to go.

Best,
Oleg

It seems wrong anyway. It should be more logical to use
 
$\mathit{HW} = \mathit{WH}$

or

$.. \mathit{coefficient}.. $

I tried it. For me it looks well.

All this is true, but the point was that you should not put math formulas 
in \mathit (which is for italic text) or, at any rate, you should not have 
to do so.  It is arguable that it was the WH that was wrong since there 
was not enough space and it looked like text, not math mode.  Whatever, 
TeX is supposed to work out the spacing automatically and doesn't.

No.  Kerning tables have nothing to do with TeX at all.  They are font
specific.  TeX uses whatever is in the .tfm files, regardless where
they come from.

Hi karl, hi texhax,

I have studied a Jan Tschichold booklet, and I have met two who studied 
spacing as graphic designers, and I have just looked again at my copy of 
TUGboat vol. 24 no. 2 [or just www.tug.org/tugboat/], and what did I see?

    TUG BOA T

-- a boat, a snake, and a single letter "T" ...

... is this an /ironical/ hint on TeX's typographical (kerning) excellence?

Please tell me more about spacing/letter-spacing ...

Happy TeXing -- Uwe.

P.S.: explicitly: if "OA" can be that tight, "AT" can be much more ... even 
"BO"

I sometimes thought I will rule this out by \nointerlineskip, then realized 
that this needs estimating ascender heights, worse than \baselineskip, then 
forgot ...

\parskip and/or \baselineskip may have shrink/stretch which may be wanted 
to remove => \newskip

Why this? Did you mean "999" to prevent implicit \nointerlineskip?

>\prevdepth=\prevdepthcalc

What about the \lineskip problem? We might rather \vskip some 
\prevdepthcalc results and then \prevdepth=0, or even less (in case of 
accent stacks in the first following line ...).

Ah, just for a possible indent, I understand.

I thought a little /LaTeX/ package could be made right now. In the meantime 
I thought of modifying \@setfontsize and \fontsize, testing for vmode, but 
\everypar may be even better. Moreover, the "next baselineskip" could be 
specified by the font size command (read baseline skip from expansion) or 
even the sectioning command (read the font size command from its expansion).

Another problem to solve for the \everypar approach is \@afterheading, 
especially with \chapter etc.

In my own case, I am assuming \normalsize text is following and suspecting: 
the designer was not aware of \section, however the few pt exceeding the 
specification with a larger font are favourable, it is nice if the white 
space is about the same with a larger following font.

Best,

     Uwe.

Indeed, the index. But there were suggestions, it seems they were worth 
trying? (The book class I am working for uses multicol instead.)

Are all of you sure that TeX uses any kerning table in $HW=WH$. Please look 
at Appendix G of the TeXbook, "Generating Boxex from Formulas".

My impression is that TeX does /not/ do any kerning here -- because it 
would be a bad idea. Kerning is good within words and only there. Kerning 
between two letters that are to represent a product or a composition would 
be confusing, making the misleading impression the two letters formed an 
/atomic/ name with an own meaning, similar to, e.g., "mod" or (in category 
theory) "ker".

On the other hand, I think there /is/ something awful here: the way TeX 
deals with slanted symbols and fonts. Same problem with $\overline{H}$ and 
that you sometimes have to deal with italic corrections (setting them with 
plainTeX or avoiding them with LaTeX). TeX treats a slanted symbol as a 
/box/ (|box|), a /rectangle/ (|rectangle|). This is why $WH$ is wider than 
$HW$ (slanted "W" has its leftmost "dot" at its top, "H" at its bottom). 
Wouldn't it be nicer if it treated it as a /parallelogram/? 
(/parallelogram/ indeed!) Trying to set them as close as possible?

Cheers,

   Uwe.

Maybe it has nothing to do with TeX, but these cmit fonts were created by 
Knuth using Metafont and are inextricably linked to TeX.  It is 
disingenuous to say that they have nothing to do with TeX.

hi, uwe,

i'm in a better position to respond to this
than karl, since i know the history of the
tugboat logo.

    I have studied a Jan Tschichold booklet, and I have met two who studied
    spacing as graphic designers, and I have just looked again at my copy of
    TUGboat vol. 24 no. 2 [or just www.tug.org/tugboat/], and what did I see?

       TUG BOA T

    -- a boat, a snake, and a single letter "T" ...

i agree with you.

    ... is this an /ironical/ hint on TeX's typographical (kerning) excellence?

i'm sure it's not intentional, but the person
who created the first tugboat cover, the first
tugboat editor, had even less formal graphics
training than i did at that point.  he used
some press-type (remember that?) that he had
on hand to put together all the type on the
cover, along with a sketch he had made of a
reproduction of what was allegedly gutenberg's
press.  there really wasn't anyone around to
give a competent critique of the typography.
and there wasn't any of the press-type left
over to try again.  (and, as a footnote, the
name of the typeface has been lost, so now
that so many electronic options are available,
no one has identified it so that the matter
could be reconsidered.)

everything on the cover and title page was
pasted up by hand for several years; with
volume 4, the type other than the logo was
set by tex, but the logo was kept.  we tried
some experiments using cminch, but the
results weren't satisfactory.  (all of this
predates type 1 fonts.)

    Please tell me more about spacing/letter-spacing ...

(you've since reworded that as "kerning".)

    Happy TeXing -- Uwe.

thanks.  we continue to do so.

    P.S.: explicitly: if "OA" can be that tight, "AT" can be much more ... even
    "BO" 

my preference would be for the "AT" to be
closed up and a little more daylight between
"OA".  now that the question is on the table,
i'll see that we take it under advisement.

Books on calligraphy cover this best IMO. A good type treatment though  
is Walter Tracy's wonderful _Letters of Credit_

David Kindersley had some interesting writings on it however, as well  
as a nifty machine / algorithm (LOGOS).

Dear Sir, 

I am using TexShop on my MacbookPro (OSX 10.6.1).. 
but i am having this error.. 

Can't find required tool.
/usr/texbin/simpdftex does not exist. Perhaps TeXLive was not installed or was removed during a system upgrade. If so, go to the TeXShop web site and follow the instructions to (re)install TeXLive. Another possibility is that a tool path is incorrectly configured in TeXShop preferences. This can happen if you are using the fink teTeX distribution.

I will appreciate any kinds of help..

Subject: [texhax] spacing too large with eqlist in moderncv
Message-ID: <70732fb40910131642u483cd7f6v2bb28a8960f7be88@mail.gmail.com>

I'm running into a problem where there is too much space after a
\section{} command if it is followed by a \cvline with an eqlist
environment in the \cvline.  My question is, why does this happen?
Where does extra space come from??

Here is a minimal example:



\documentclass[12pt,letterpaper,draft]{moderncv}

\moderncvtheme[green]{classic}
\AtBeginDocument{\recomputelengths}                     % required
when changes are made
                                                        % to page layout lengths


% personal data
\firstname{Some}
\familyname{Name}
\address{Address}{More Address}
\phone{Phone number}
\email{email address}


\usepackage{eqlist}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Good amount of space below}
\cventry{year--year}{dedree}{college}{place}{GPA}{description}

\section{Too much space below}
\cvline{}{%
\begin{eqlist*}[\setlength{\itemsep}{0em}%
				\setlength{\topsep}{0em}%
				\setlength{\partopsep}{0em}%
				\setlength{\parskip}{0em}%
				\setlength{\parsep}{0em}%
			   ]%
	\item[item 1] some text somdtext some text some text some text some text some%
	\item[item 2] some more text%
\end{eqlist*}%
}

\section{Good amount of space below}
\begin{eqlist*}[\setlength{\itemsep}{0em}%
				\setlength{\topsep}{0em}%
				\setlength{\partopsep}{0em}%
				\setlength{\parskip}{0em}%
				\setlength{\parsep}{0em}%
			   ]%
	\item[item 1] some text somdtext some text some text some text some text some%
	\item[item 2] some more text%
\end{eqlist*}%


\end{document}



I know an easy way to fix this is just to add a negative \vspace
before the eqlist environment, but I want to know why there is extra
space at all.  I want to know where it comes from.

Thanks!

eqlist environment if if comes after a section command.  Here is the
correct minimal example:

It compiles for me on 10.6 after copying /usr/share/automake-1.10/config.guess over the version included in the Unix subdirectory.  

This looks like the bug reported here:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1626194&group_id=22324&atid=374868

I compiled as 32 bit only by setting CC=gcc-4.0, since I wouldn't bet on it being 64 bit clean.  It produced a binary, but I haven't bothered testing it.

As Reinhard has told you, this message says it all.

If you already had installed TeXLive, maybe when you installed Snow  
Leopard it was deleted. So download MacTeX again and reinstall it.

If you haven't installed MacTeX previously, please remember that  
TeXShop is just a front-end to TeX & friends applications. Go to

http://www.tug.org/mactex/

download MacTeX.mpkg.zip and install it.

Best,

Axel

Sorry, my below was a /question/: sure that TeX does any kerning in $WH$? (/?/)

Another question: does anybody know typesetting programs that treat slanted 
symbols as parallelograms rather than rectangles?

Hi folks
\strut, \vtop and lblot. I'd be grateful for a brief description of 
each, more precisely, the general effect on the presentation.

Here's an example of two of them in use taken from The Z Notation: a 
Reference Manual by Michael Spivey.

$birthday$:
\[
	known = \{\,{\rm John, Mike, Susan}\,\} \\
\also
	birthday = \{\,\vtop{\halign{\strut#\hfil&${}\mapsto{}$#\hfil\cr
			John&  25--Mar,\cr
			Mike&  20--Dec,\cr
			Susan& 20--Dec\,\}.\cr}}
\]
Truth be told I've seldom come across anything so cryptic. For 
example, what does the "#" signify?
Any help would be most appreciated.
Thanks in advance
Paul

Thanks a lot, William! I will tell the publishers they should read this. So 
I get letter-spacing info although the posting was about kerning.

Actually, there is just

     C H A P T E R  1

`\kern0.25em' manually inserted. I professional designer I asked said it 
looks bad, at least with cmr at 16pt. It seems to look better with Adobe 
Caslon.

     Uwe.

    \strut, \vtop and lblot. I'd be grateful for a brief description of each,
    more precisely, the general effect on the presentation.

\strut gives a vertical rule of zero width
and the height and depth of a parenthesis.
its purpose is to ensure even line spacing,
especially in alignments like the one you
cite.

\vtop ensures that the first line of the
aligned block is on the same baseline as
the preceding text, "birthday".

the hash # is where an argument is dropped
into a frame.  (it's equivalent to #1 for
the first argument in a \def.)  so the
first line expands to
  John \mapsto 25--Mar

hope that makes sense.  this is plain tex,
*very* plain tex.

Hi Paul,

I neither know about `lblot' nor see another occurrence of it. The rest is 
about Alignment as described in Chapters 12 and 22 of Knuth's TeXbook. 
\strut is a kind of invisible generic symbol to provide (if possible) equal 
baseline distances when the usual line spacing method has been disabled. 
The latter happens (for reasons I have never investigated) with horizontal 
alignment (\halign) that your sample shows, i.e., building tables very 
close to TeX's primitives. While the hash mark`#' refers to macro 
parameters otherwise, it refers to the content of a table cell when 
algorithm to process table rows is specified in the first "template" row of 
an \halign.

For reasons not entirely clear to me up to now, you find \halign always 
within in a "vertical box", \vbox, \vtop, or \vcenter. These three 
alternatives refer to alignment of "high" boxes relative to each other in a 
line, but also influence "line spacing" (a hard matter of the subject 
"baseline-to-baseline skips"). \vtop means that the first line is mainly 
considered for alignment within a line, the other lines of it are pushed 
down. \vbox focuses on the last line instead. \vcenter centers the whole 
stack within a line.

LaTeX provides `tabular', `array', and similar environments to save you 
from learning these things ...

... haha, a try at a resume of some very hard things from TeX in a few 
minutes, fostered by some beer, hope it helps though ...

    Uwe.

My intention was to address you rather then karl, but I thought I must

More general and simple, ignoring TeX, a question to professional graphical 
designers: What relevance is there in specifying baseline-to-baseline 
skips? I thought that the white space is more relevant and should be 
specified instead.

fact that this is plain tex and not the more streamlined LaTeX. 
Still, where would I find Knuth's book on plain TeX? Is it freely 
available in plain TeX?
this is slowly turning into a parallel to Russell's paradox.

I can't answer your questions better than Barbara.  

If you need more information about plain TeX. it's advisable to
consult a tutorial.  A few of them are available on-line, for example:

  http://www.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/info/impatient/book.pdf 

\halign is explained on page 178.

BTW, plain TeX is not really cryptic.  Try to understand this code:

Please read the text at the bottom of every list mail. You will find a

The discussion on "accessibility" went on with BB's

Just tangling TeX is rarely sufficient; normally at the very
least you need a "change" file which adapts the source to
the target platform, and in your case, that same change
file may need to address any deviations between the dialect
of PASCAL supported by the compiler and the dialect used by
Don in writing the source.  Early issues of TUGBoat should
contain some material about compilation from source, I imagine.

Look up the meaning and usage of \halign in The TeXbook or in
TeX by Topic; or skip it entirely!  The first line (up to \cr)
of \halign is a template, and # shows where the text of the
following rows is inserted in the template.

Forced to look (for the very first time) at

for the standard 35 Adobe/PostScript fonts,
I am puzzled by many of the ?encoding? suffices.

I see (for example) 7t, 8c, 8r, 8t, 8y and
even an 8rn, but looking (also for the first

only "8r: TeX base" of the above 6 ?encoding?
suffices.  Could someone please enlighten me
as to the meaning of the other five (and of
any I may have missed), and also let me have
a reference to an authoritative document
describing these ?

Many thanks in advance :

ok, as Philip Taylor & Donald Arseneau observe, \[...\] is the LaTeX way of 
writing $$...$$. \also may be a Spivey-defined macro. I think rather than 
understanding the remaining plainTeX constructs, Paul Stanley wants to know 
what you see if you are able to:

"Z Notation" seems to be a kind of program language referring to formal 
logic and set theory, therefore math mode is preferred. Spivey seems to use 
the primitive \halign because with little typing you get nice tricks.

"birthday" seems to refer to a map defined on the set containing John, 
Mike, and Susan.
The notation typesets "birthday:" (in an ugly way, as DA notes), preceding 
something horizontally centered. This thing first specifies "known" to 
declare the domain set of the map, using curly braces. Then there is a 
table describing the map. It has three rows and two columns. \halign is 
used to automatically insert the mapping left-to-right arrow \mapsto 
between the two cells of a row. This arrow has a little vertical bar at the 
left, saying which member of the domain gets which value under the map, not 
to be confused with the left-to-right arrow declaring domain and codomain 
of the map. This map "birthday" accordingly maps John to 25--Mar, Mike to 
20--Dec, and Susan to the same. A curly brace opens at the left of "John" 
in the first row, and another closes the third row.

\also may be a Z notation symbol that is in a line between the "known" 
declaration and the first row of the table.

like "birthday", "known", "John", "Mike", and "Susan" are typeset in a way 
they shouldn't be.

Hope anybody reads this -- Uwe.

    but is it ?  On trying to compile it, I am told

    	! Undefined control sequence.
    	l.2     \[

    which rather met my expectations.  So what /is/ it,
    I am forced to ask ?!

what i meant, and wasn't as clear as
i should have been, is that the \halign
construction is plain tex, not the whole
example file.

it's usually possible to use plain tex
constructions within a latex environment
(and sometimes absolutely necessary, such
as when one is creating some .cls or .sty
files), but for an end user, usually not
a good idea.

    P.S. I /was/ going to say that it would be far more
    comprehensible if greater attention had been paid
    to layout, but if -- as I suspect -- Paul Stanley
    is using a speech synthesiser to examine the material,
    then I am not sure that better layout would help.

yes, that's true.  thanks for the reminder,
phil.  this means that the computer file
of the texbook (already cited by someone
else) is one of the right places for paul
to look, although some of it may be tough
sledding, since it's an example of using
the concepts it's talking about.

Hello
The txfonts option provides the option to set a rounded "v" in math.
This can be done locally with "\varv"or in the preample more 
generally (but then 4 letters will be changed in mathmode).

The problem is that there is - AFAIK - no way to get a rounded "v" in 
the normal text. 

So an expression like

x_{\mathrm v} 

delivers the standard "v" from txfonts, but not a rounded (upright) 
one. 
 And "{\mathrm \varv}" does not deliver any an upright letter at all.

Is there a simple way to change this?  
I need the possibility to get an  upright rounded "v" in text mode?

BTW: a type1-font like Times-Europa (Monotype) has it's "v"s always 
rounded, but is  no choice here because the book would then need more 
pages (Times-Europa is quite widerunning).

Thanks in advance
hh

Does anyone know how I can compile tex from its source. I run tangle on
tex.web  to get the pascal file but when running gpc on tex.p, I get some
errors.

Thanks

You may need some patch for your OS. I compiled it from sources only
in my TL copy, just by running

./Build --without-xindy

in the Build/source directory. I cannot compile xindy because I do not
have clisp but Joachim Schrod wrote me some time ago where I can find
it.

Vafa is considering to compile tex.p directly
by a Pascal compiler.

You need two additional libraries.  There are detailed instructions in
Build/source/utils/README.  You can even paste portions of this file
into a shell script and the reqired packages will be downloaded
automatically.

LaTeX is the most accessible system for typsetting maths but the end 
result is usually the exact opposite. So any help from the list 
members is always very welcome

	\[ \{~p: PERSON | age(p) \geq 16~\} \]
	A simple set definition. Any idea what the "~" is supposed to do?

I gave a talk recently for an association of blind people and people 
working with the blind.

One of the things we looked at is representing math in a way such that 
the blind can read it.

One of the ideas is to use the co-called octo-braille to represent 
ANSII, and then present well prepared LaTeX code for the blind to read.

Using standard LaTeX macro names are not that good as they often hide 
the true meaning of the equation.

For example in topology \cong often means isomorphy, so

X \isomorph Y gives much better meaning than X \cong Y

it usually represents a non-breakable space

in math is doesn't really have any meaning, I'm guessing here that the 
author is misusing it to provide some extra space instead of using a say 
\ followed by a space.

Why is the use of tilde in math mode a misuse?  it is the most 
keyboard-efficient of getting a controlled spacing.  I _think_ it is 
controlled...

In this instance, sighted people reading the final typeset version are no
better off when it comes to interpreting the maths: they see the visual
output of "\cong" and have to decide from context whether that symbol
means isomorphism, some form of approximate equality, or whatever else it
gets used for.

So if authors consistently defined a separate alias (such as \isomorph,
\approxeq) for each distinct use of the same symbol (\cong), interpreting
the maths would become easier for everyone with access to the LaTeX
source, not just blind people. I seem to recall the amsmath guide
recommends doing just this.

I guess the downside for blind people would be that instead of having to
learn a (relatively) small set of standard symbol names, there would be a
large set of command names to interpret, many of which would produce the
same visual output. It's probably impossible to define standard commands
for every possible distinct use of the same mathematical symbol (research
papers for example very often have to define new notation as needed for
new concepts). So some command names will end up being author-defined,
and there's no guarantee everyone will consistently choose the same name
for the same thing. In the worst case, interpreting a command would
involve finding the macro definition, figuring out what standard command
it produces, and *then* figuring out it's mathematical meaning from the
standard command anyway.

I wonder if we're not better off as we are, with (more or less) a unique
command for each unique symbol.

Message-ID: <2b6e342f0910171250h634a18edo37de3537f0aad743@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

I want to write a formula of the style X'_nX_n. (note the
transpose/apostrophe after the first X)

However, as i type this in math mode i get that the subscript n of the
first X lies below the one of the second X.

I want both subscripts to be at the same height.

I could do it by implementing either

{X'}_n or {X_n}'

but the look of these is not what i want. I really would like the
apostrophe above the _n and both subscripts to be at the same height.

Any help on how to achieve this would be greatly appreciated

thanks.
robert

If it is only this one formula then X'_nX^{}_n should do. If you want to 
unify the height of sub- and superscripts in all formulas you can use 
package subdepth <http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subdepth>.

The dvi file does not have the fonts and images embedded. You need a 
dvi-driver in order to print the document or generate documents that are 
useful for electronic distribution.

Did you look carefully at the output?  The first gives opening quotation
marks on the left (as one would wish) while the second only giives closing
marks.

Well, MiKTeX doesn't know about grammatically correct use of quotation
marks.

not really, because the naming should show the mathematical meaning of 
the symbol, not describing how it looks. Such that when reading the code 
the equation starts to resemble how it is actually read out loud.

Think of the scrolling text green from the Matrix movie.

The problem is that the meaning of the expression gets lost, we are 
doing a visual representaion of an equation, but the underlying meaning 
is lost.

For example where I work some people use the notation

X \sim N(0,1)

to say taht X is a stochastic variable which has a normal distribution, 
whereas

x \sim\sim N(0,1)

is an observation from such a variable.

Reading that makes no sense at all, but using better names for symbols 
it becomes much more readable.

X \DistAs N(0,1)

x \ObsFromDist N(0,1)

One should also think not jsut of the reader, but also co-authors, using 
better more descriptive names for macros makes cooperation a lot easier, 
and perhaps we will get rid of a lot of the mess people are doing be 
using there very short non-descriptive macro names, that I know scare 
most journal editors.

as far as I can gather from the other messages Paul is legally blind, so

BTW: Paul, have you ever heard of robobraille.org?

As for the quotation marks, the reason they are different is that in 
type we often use two different marks for the quotations, one to open it 
and one to close it afterwards. This even depends on language.

You might even see `" and '" being used.


With ''word'' there is no distinction between the opening and the 
closing mark.

A much more readable solution is to use the csquote package, and its 
\enquote (might be another name), then it is much more clearly marked 
that \enquote{some text} is enclosed in quotation marks, and this macro 
is even language aware, thus auto chooses the appropriate quotation 
marks for that lanuage.

So, let me recap:
`` produces a double left quote;
` a single left quote;
'' a double right quote;
' a single right quote

That's correct, at least for English and other languages that use the
same quotes. For other languages there may be different quote symbols. I
wouldn't know how to access them in plain TeX, but for LaTeX there are
special commands, sometimes requiring extra packages.

Message-ID: <20091018222648.DDDE2093.aamtaout03-winn.ispmail.ntl.com@pine.ntlworld.com>

Hi folks
First off
thanks for the help with the previous thread.
The question concerns the correct amount of horizontal spacing 
between a single quote and a double quote mark. for example,
``\thinspace`bla bla'\thinspace''
`\thinspace``rabit rabit rabit''\thinspace'
or is it
`{}``my name is Michael Caine''{}'
``{}`That's a very tasteful peace of work, Miss Emmin'{}''

I suppose the next question is whether the full stop (or period to 
our North American friends) is simply the "." or some other control 
sequence. Again, do remember that I'm playing with plain Tex at this 
moment in time.
Thanks
Paul

The trouble is, another author might use some other set of names to mean
exactly the same thing, such as

X \distributedas N(0,1)

X \sampledfrom N(0,1)

At least sighted people can easily look at the typeset output and see
that these both produce the same notation, which makes it a bit easier to
guess that they mean the same thing. A blind person might have to trawl
through many layers of LaTeX code to discover that.

I always try to define "semantic" aliases for notation, for exactly the
reasons you listed, and others too: it makes it clearer for coauthors, it
even makes it clearer for myself when I come to read it a few months
later! And it lets me easily change the notation if I need to, just by
changing one preamble definition.

But, not being blind myself, I can't really say what whether the benefits
of better symbol names would outweigh the disadvantage of there being
many different author-specific variants that mean the same thing.

One thing's clear: it wouldn't be a bad idea if authors put some
consideration into making LaTeX readable for blind people. (At least,
it's not something that had ever occurred to me before the discussions on
this list.)

         Paul: The current system of naming control sequences/macros 
isn't so much a problem as the lack of comprehensive and descriptive 
documentation.

         Braille is very similar to LaTeX in a sense that the same 
symbols (dot combos) are used to represent different functions right 
across the various codes: music, maths, literacy etc.
         For example, all six dots, assuming we are using the 6-dot 
system,, represent the letter sequence "for" in grade II literacy 
braille, the equal sign in grade 0 (computer braille) and the f with 
a semibreve or semiquaver value in music. I'm sure there are other 
uses that I've forgotten.
         Of course, one would identify the specific function of the 
symbol based on the context in which it appears.
         The point being that most braillists would've been through 
the process of adjusting to the idea of an elaborate typsetting 
system with overloaded symbols in their formative years.
         Regards
         Paul

\thinspace is a bit too large, IMO.

Yes, a full stop is simply the ".".  However, the space after the full
stop is usually larger than the normal interword space.  You don't
want this extra space after an abbreviation.  You have to say

  abrr.\ some text

in this case in order to get normal interword glue.

Or turn on \frenchspacing.

Of course one can make additional kerning spaces ? la \thinspace. I  
usually use two extra positive thin spaces:

\def\fino{\kern 0.1em }
\def\finito{\kern 0.05em }

(\fino from Spanish ``thin'' and \finito from ``very thin'')

and one negative:

\def\finoneg{\kern -0.1em }

In (La)TeX, \thinspace is defines as {\kern .16667em }. The space  
between the dimension and the closing bracket *does* matter.


Best,

Axel

I was very impressed.

What?  I thought LaTeX3 would have 
   / 
  |  
 /
as its integral command. 

:-) 
... I wonder how modern speech synthesis programs "read aloud"
such visual emoticons.

It's a measure relative to the size of the font you're using ---for a  
10 point size is roughly 10 points, for a 12 point size it's 12  
points, etc. It's the best way to define certain dimensions, like  
thinspace or parindent.

I don't think you will see, errrm encounter, those combinations,
but rather "` and "'.  That would be with LaTeX plus the babel package
where the language support for some languages makes the double-quote
character active, and uses it as a prefix to generate all sorts of 
special characters or even hyphenation points.  For example, german
support makes "` a german left lowered quote, which looks like
,, (comma comma).

Yes.

So you're not going to get the LaTeX babel specials in plain TeX,
where the double quote is a plain character.  In the plain "cm"
fonts, it corresponds to a double right quote, but other fonts
have a double upright (symmetric) quote in that character
position.

Really? Where? Or is this a confusion with german.sty/babel-german, where 
the double quote """ is active and has "`" or "'" as argument to generate 
German double quotes? -- In the meantime I misread your sentence as

     You might even see ``' and `'' begin used.

quoting single quotes using single quotes ...

At this point I just would like to know: do you read out loud "cap" and 
"cup", or do you say something like "union of" or "intersection of", 
resembling the German reading out loud?

\frenchspacing should be turned on globally only if you write in a
language where the space after a period should not be enlarged.  Is
\frenchspacing used in the UK?

Subject: [texhax] vanishing tab characters and docstrip
Message-ID: <20091019154257.GA15829@gmx.net>

Hello list!

With docstrip and the package doc, I want to generate commented
Makefile code (and code using other programming languages, too)
instead of LaTeX code.  Running either tex or latex on the .ins
installation file
    latex test.ins
kills all tab characters at the beginning of a line.  Because of
the Makefile syntax requiring tab characters at the beginning of
some lines, docstrip's behaviour is unsolicited and in some sense
"erroneous".

Here are the two files of a minmalistic example, the .ins
installation file `test.ins' and the .dtx documented source code
file `test.dtx':

----------snip---------- test.ins ----------snip----------
\input docstrip
% ---------- Misc ----------
%\keepsilent%
%\showprogress%
%\askforoverwritefalse%
%\askforoverwritetrue%
% ---------- LaTeX driver ----------
\generate{\file{test-driver.tex}{\from{test.dtx}{driver}}}%
% ---------- Makefile ----------
% Trick from bibexports
{\catcode`\#=12%
  \gdef\DoubleSharp{##}}%
\let\MetaPrefix\DoubleSharp%
\preamble%
Preamble for the Makefile.
\endpreamble%
% Trick from apacite
\edef\noendinputpostamble{%
  \MetaPrefix ^^J%
  \MetaPrefix\space End of `\outFileName'.}%
\generate{\usepostamble\noendinputpostamble%
  \file{test-makefile.txt}{\from{test.dtx}{makefile}}}%
\endbatchfile
----------snap---------- test.ins ----------snap----------

and

----------snip---------- test.dtx ----------snip----------
% \iffalse
%<*driver>
\ProvidesFile{test.dtx}%
\documentclass{article}%
\usepackage{doc}%
\AlsoImplementation\CodelineIndex\listfiles
\begin{document}\DocInput{test.dtx}\end{document}%
%</driver>
% \fi
% Documentation\ldots
% \StopEventually{}
% Implementation\ldots
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<*makefile>
# Lines starting with tab character:
all:
	echo Hello world!
	@echo Hello world again!
	printf "Hello\tworld!\n"
# Lines starting with blanks:
 one
  two
   three
%</makefile>
%    \end{macrocode}
% \Finale
----------snap---------- test.dtx ----------snap----------

Searching for an explanation of docstrip's behavior, I looked
into docstrip.tex and its documentation.  There, the macro
\readsource (l. 584) reads the .dtx documented TeX file line
after line and calls \processLine (l. 344).  \processLine uses
\normalLine (l. 314+) - and all seems to be very unsuspicious to
me.

\def\normalLine#1\endLine{%
  \maybeMsg{.}%
  \def\inLine{#1}%
  \let\do\putline at do
  \activefiles
}

Then the macro \putline at do is executed

\def\putline at do#1#2#3{%
  \StreamPut#1{\inLine}}

and finally the real work is be done by \StreamPut (l. 203):

\def\StreamPut{\immediate\write}

I didn't find any implementation of \immediate or \write either
in docstrip.tex nor in the whole LaTeX code (source2e), so it
seems to be pure TeX (which I didn't know much about).  But where
in this whole process the tab characters vanish?

How can I avoid docstrip killing tab characters at the input
line's beginning?  Can anybody give me a hint?

Many thanks in advance,
Mathias

Fine, thanks Karl : a very useful document.

That doesn't matter : I suspect such files would work
only with LaTeX, and what I am looking for is sufficient
information to update my PS-Fonts suite (unpublished,
last updated 1994, based on the ArborText names, TFM
files and driver) to be useable with PdfTeX under TeX Live.
PS-Fonts is intended for use with Plain TeX, or even with
IniTeX with a little additional work.

Er, yes : why is it that the word "anarchy" springs unbidden to mind ?!

I would rename them into something like \union and \intersection, X \cap 
Y does not make any sense.

The major problem is that texts prepared for blind to read, needs to be 
written with a blind audience in mind.

At least naming symbols in a way such that equations make sense when 
spoken, then one does not actually need to know that many symbols.

Hi
Just thought the list might benefit from a repeat of the points below 
coming from a totally blind LaTeX user:

         Paul: The current system of naming control sequences/macros 
isn't so much a problem as the lack of comprehensive and descriptive 
documentation.

         Braille is very similar to LaTeX in a sense that the same 
symbols (dot combos) are used to represent different functions right 
across the various codes: music, maths, literacy etc.
         For example, all six dots, assuming we are using the 6-dot 
system,, represent the letter sequence "for" in grade II literacy 
braille, the equal sign in grade 0 (computer braille) and the f with 
a semibreve or semiquaver value in music. I'm sure there are other 
uses that I've forgotten.
         Of course, one would identify the specific function of the 
symbol based on the context in which it appears.
         The point being that most braillists would've been through 
the process of adjusting to the idea of an elaborate typsetting 
system with overloaded symbols in their formative years.
         Regards
         Paul

On the other hand, I use them mainly not for set theory, but for
describing curves as "convex $\cup$" or "concave $\cap$", in which
case the existing names are sensible.

Well then one will need to rename all their derivatives (and
pseudoderivatives) as well including \Cup and  \sqdoublecap or maybe
even \Coffeecup and \Capricorn (should we?)
Sure if we had a time machine we could give better names from the very
beginning but now we can only create a royal mess and pain

Hello,

at the moment - the german book fair was certainly a suitable 
propagation place - machines are offered for reading books on a 
screen. 

But what happens if someone wants to "hear" the book? If the machine  
can't do it now, in the future they will quite certainly be able to 
do that.

But what happens with scientific books? If you have something which 
appears printed as "320 kJ/kmol" or 1?C, how that will be read?

I'm aware that packages like "siunitx" might be the source of a 
solution as - when using them - you have to write 
"\SI{320}{\kilojoule\per\kilomole}" or \SI1\degreecelsius. Which in 
of course seems much more suitable to be transformed in some kind of 
voice readable (unvisible) text.

Question: Was anything done already to make the voice reading (by 
machine) of scientific text to a person more easy? Is there any 
information available? Or is this too far for TeX?

With regards
hh

    even \Coffeecup and \Capricorn (should we?)
    Sure if we had a time machine we could give better names from the very
    beginning but now we can only create a royal mess and pain

the particular names in question were
assigned by don knuth.  this is only a
hypothesis, but i believe that he was
following a long tradition of proofreaders
to use the names \cup and \cap.  if this
is so, then i seriously doubt that any
change would be be likely, particularly
in light of the alternate meanings that
have been pointed out.

it might be noted that in fact there
*are* some alternate names for some
symbols, either because they are in
different classes:
  \triangle, \bigtriangleup
  \backslash, \setminus
or for some other reason:
  \ne, \neq
  \ni, \owns
  \wedge, \land
  \vee, \lor
  \neg, \lnot

this list obviously favors knuth's own
needs, but it shows that there is no
built-in prejudice against multiple
names.  my guess is that \ne and \ni
are so similar that the ease of finding
typos in a file where both are used
would be more important than ease of
typing, and for the logical operators,
the clarity of meaning would be the
deciding factor for which was used.
special-purpose packages have renamed
quite a few symbols for the sake of
clarified meaning (i'm thinking here
of the zed package).  the important
thing is to avoid re-use of names
that have already been assigned.

but authors seem to prefer ease of
typing to clarity of content.  this
wreaks havoc in the ams production
system, where fully linked, on-line
posting of journal articles requires
use of hyperref -- which redefines a
very large number of the "short names".
so these all have to be changed by hand,
leading to the possibility of introduced
errors.  no amount of warnings against
not redefining one- or two-letter names
seems to have any effect.  (this has
gotten off the original topic, for
which i apologize, but if anyone has
a compelling argument that will convince
authors that "clarity is better than
brevity", i'll be delighted to learn it.
i also apologize to authors with limited
manual capability, but there are other
ways to get around that, like editors
with abbreviation-expansion features.)

I am a very slow typer (albeit my kids claim that I am incredibly fast
for 1.5 fingers I use) but still thinking what to type takes me much
much longer than to type, and retype and retype again. I presume that
people who want brevity do not think what to type and belong to the
following classes (a) authors with limited manual capacity (b)
secretaries (c) obfuscators (d) bullshitters. :-) I suspect that each
subsequent class is much larger than the previous one

\ni is inverted \in, so \ot is inverted \to (i.e. \leftarrow). I tried
to note that \ni lacks logic

    That doesn't matter : I suspect such files would work
    only with LaTeX

1) I was suggesting looking for .enc and .etx simply for additional
   information on what the encodings are, rather than about actually
   using them.

2) .enc files are not related to LaTeX specifically, and are necessary
   for any remapping to support different encodings at the PostScript
   level.  I.e., they are referred to in psfonts.map.

OK, now understood.

Ah, that is interesting : I know nothing about "psfonts.map"
and had been intending to use virtual fonts; is it the case
that I would not need virtual fonts, PdfTeX being able to
re-map fonts on the fly based on information in "psfonts.map" ?

Hi Phil,
"psfonts.map" is described in the dvips manual.  pdfTeX uses its own
map file, "pdftex.map", described in the pdfTeX manual.  Both files
are quite similar.  However, don't edit these files, they are created
automatically by updmap[-sys].  

I don't know what you intend, but if you change the font encoding, you
almost always have to create a new tfm file.  At least unless you are
talking about monospaced fonts.

BTW, if you are using pdfTeX, you can use the primitive \pdfmapline
instead of creating map files.

If you need assistance, the tex-fonts mailing list is certainly a good
place to ask. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

I thought (but it is a long time since I played with
such things) that all I would need to do was to create
a VP file (virtual property list) specifying one
or more base fonts and the necessary mappings, and
then convert this to a VF.  Have I misunderstood
(or mis-remembered) this ?

    create a VP file ...
    
You can do reencoding with vp/vf.  But you do not need to.  You can do
it purely by creating tfm's and pdftex.map entries (psfonts.map for
dvips).  This is preferable since it is one less file to get wrong, or
for people using obscure drivers to have trouble with.

Dear Sirs,

I'm a LaTeX user, but not a programmer. Anyway, I've purchased the  
mtpro package
and find myself disturbed by the layout of curly braces \{ and \},  
since I prefer the design in cmr. How can I can change the appeareance  
of these math delimiter (by using those in cmr) while employing the  
mtpro package?

I thank you in advance for the response,

BEST,

Damiano.

Thanks, Karl : I take your point, but surely using VP/VF is more
likely to work regardless of the driver than using PdfTeX.map ?

After all, the latter will work only with PdfTeX (if I understand
correctly), whereas VFs/VPs have been around since 1990 (almost
twenty years) ...

Hello. I would guess(!) something like this might work

\renewcommand{\{}%
{\mathchoice{\fontfamily{cmex}\selectfont\{ }%
                  {\fontfamily{cmex}\selectfont\{ }%
                  {\fontfamily{cmex}\selectfont\{ }%
                  {\fontfamily{cmex}\selectfont\{ }} 

I did not try it.

Better might be to use vf-files (which is not exactly easy to do).

For the archives:

Following an advice of Martin Schr?der the best solution seems to
be using a space character at the respective source code line's
beginning, which will be translated with
    sed -e 's/^ /\t'
*after* running LaTeX/TeX on the .ins installation file.

Moreover with that tab character handling there's no need to
configure the Emacs mode docTeX/FM, which doesn't normally allow
the user to save any tabs at all.  They were translated to 8
space characters on the fly.

Converting pdf files to html is not task of TeX.
What can be done? Use htlatex to generate html rather than pdf
However beamer is not supported, rewrite as powerdot (which is rather easy).
Adding Slidy http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/#(1) allows
presentation like this

http://weyl.math.toronto.edu/Experimental/Talk_5A.html

(made ONLY to check how it works)

Hello, I got a solution after tweaking the solution here:
http://www.madcomputerscientist.net/blog/home/2007/08/converting-beamerpdf-presentations-to.html

He was suggesting GS - yes. Except the latter tools which I don't have it on
ubuntu

Tools :
gs - well, we have it most of the time
igal - creating HTML thumbnails/gallery
ImageMagick - I use convert to change the resolution ... I can't set from gs
output 640x480 at first.. rather to tweak it later.

Here goes:

  gs -dNOPAUSE -g1024x768 -r205 -sDEVICE=pngalpha
-sOutputFile=./temp/slide_%d.png -dBATCH beamer-foss-my-09.pdf

 for i in *.png; do convert -resize 640x480 $i new/$i ; done

 cd new/

 ls

 igal2 -r *


Done! - I am so happy...

Why one need to do this is a mystery (and it has nothing to do with
TeX). But wiki with PDF handler plugin does this in very subtle way.

Hmmm : 1 \over \root {g} comes out very poorly at

	http://weyl.math.toronto.edu/Experimental/Talk_5A.html#(9)

the "\over" is almost impossible to see, and
until I did a "view image" on the "\root {g}",
I thought it was a part of the root sign ...

Message-ID: <F4C358B3-7953-4D2F-9A71-F69C3627E4B4@gmail.com>

If I want to place text in a succession of boxes, the best solution I  
have found is the framed package.
However, if I have more than one \begin{framed} ... \end{framed} next  
to one another they suddenly space out some times when I want them to  
stay close together.

Is there a solution using this package?
or should I be using another package?

The key point is some of the text stretches over from one page to the  
next, and I want this to be properly in a box. Hence I cannot use a  
table/tabular or even longtable because each cell seems to have to be  
on one page.

Thanks for any suggestions,

Christopher

I agree tex4ht is not perfect; more precisely, html has a lot of
shortcomings for math. There are different variants (using jsMath or
Mathml) but I misplaced these experiments. The only thing I did was to
follow advices of Eitan and add Slidy from w3

I'm forced to agree, and even adding the apparently

Of course I'd forgotten :-)  But worse, I failed to
put on my +2.0 glasses and see that David had
actually used braces around the subscript; to me,
they looked like round brackets, and I could not
understand why it was subscripting everything and
not just the first term !  Normally +1.25 are fine
for screen work, but they don't really shew the
difference between braces and round brackets ...

I tried again tonite to get these two fonts (Frutiger and AGaramond) to play
with my TeXLive install (Fedora10). The files referenced by Axel above are
not created. Though updmap runs without complaints, I can't see that a
corresponding entry is created in any of the different pdfonts files.

Any suggestions as to what I may do to get these fonts to work with my
TeXLive2007. (I've used them successfully prior to Te2007). Is is an option
to re-install TeX??

Also a bit OT but pdftoswf <http://www.swftools.org/> can be used to

There is a french package "boites" which could be redefined to the 
wanted effect(s). Not perfect but for your purpose probably quite 
useful.
But if you don't read french, keep away.

\usepackage{framed} is some kind of solution, as you noticed.  How to 
keep the boxes from spreading - try \clearpage at the end of the 
page.  But of course, if you have a lot of boxes and a long book, you 
have a lot of try and error.

The clever use of  \enlargethispage{n\baselineskip}   (n might even 
be negative) might give useful results.

About the last question, I think uninstalling TL2007 and then  
reinstalling it would be the way. But you might get into trouble with  
dependencies ---you might be asked to uninstall first programs that  
depend on TL.

Now ---by any chance would you have an invisible directory called  
something like .texlive2007 in your $HOME? If so, could you check if  
inside it there are some psfonts and pdftex map files?

Best,

Axel

Glad to know. Now --- updmap can be tricky because you can invoke it as

updmap, which updates the user's map files (within .texlive2007 in  
your case); or as

updmap-sys, which updates system-wide map files (within /var/lib/texmf/ 
fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/ in your case, I think, **if** you have write  
permissions to that directory); or as

sudo updmap-sys, which also updates system-wide map files in the  
latter directory, but owned by root.

I think maybe sometime you invoked it as ``sudo updmap'', which then  
updated the map files inside .texlive2007, but **owned by root**; then  
a further simple updmap couldn't update those map files because of the  
permissions issue you mention.

Personally, I don't like map files within .texliveXXXX, so I put my  
personal fonts in texmf-local (TeXLive 2008), and **always** use  
``sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=<font>.map''. But as your setting is  
already working, I think you should leave it like that.

Best,

Axel

The language need not stop you. I posted a translation of the french
comments some time ago, and I think Martin Kohm put them on CTAN. If you
can't find it, feel free to send me a personal eMail, and I can send it
to you.

I don't know what you mean by "suddenly" or "some times".  If there 
is an inconsistency you need to give a concrete demonstration for 
debugging.

The space between consecutive framed environments is \topsep plus a 
baseline skip (note I didn't say \baselineskip, the parameter; the 
distance is \baselineskip - \FrameHeightAdjust).  To make two frames 
abut (touch) you can (locally) set length \topsep as 0pt, and put a 
\nointerlineskip command in between the environemnts.

There is another way to defeat the usual "\addvspace{\topsep}"
and that is to fake a preceding skip, using a commandm like this:
\newcommand\notopsep{\vskip-\topsep \vskip\topsep}
Then you can put 
\notopsep \nointerlineskip
between framed environments to make them touch.  (You can
likewise use \notopsep between lists or quotations or whatever.)

While \topsep is the spearation LaTeX always inserts for set-off 
paragraph environments like lists and center (-ed text) and 
quotations, should it really be used by framed?  I think framed 
separation looks good with just the baselineskip.  Perhaps it 
should be a new length parameter that *defaults* to \topsep.  
Opinions please?

I wrote: \notopsep, but this doesn't eliminate the spacing,
because the space below the preceding frame is still there.

One could use:

\newcommand\notopsep{\par \vskip-\lastskip \vskip-\topsep \vskip\topsep}

In case you haven't figured this out yet, \lblot is defined to be a
math symbol (\@mc is made equivalent to \mathchardef on the previous
line "\let\@mc=\mathchardef").  The family of that character (the
second hex digit) depends on the current value of \oxfam (see
definition of \@fz, which basically produces a hex digit corresponding
to the value of \oxfam).

See The TeXbook for explanation of \mathchardef and math symbol
definitions.

No, it is the other way round: e.g. the xdv2pdf-driver of xetex (now
no longer the default driver) doesn't support virtual fonts. On the
other side every actual driver that can handle type1 fonts has
something similar to pdftex.map/psfonts.map and can do the
reencoding. And updmap nowadays generates all the relevant maps so
you only have to setup one map-file. 

If the real font (the pfb) contains all the symbols needed for the
TeX-encoding for which you want to set up the fonts, then you can do
the reencoding in the map file if you want. Virtual fonts are needed
when you want to do more, e.g. pull symbols from more then one font
or manipulate individual symbols.

OK, thanks for the update Ulrike : I confess
I am /staggered/ that there exist drivers that
don't support virtual fonts 20 years after
DEK introduced them, but that's life !

I could not find any relevant notes. Except Eitan wrote that by
default inlinemath is html (if possible) and displaymath is png

I did few other experiments few years ago

http://weyl.math.toronto.edu/Experimental2   (htlatex + Slidy + jsMath)

one needs a MathML capable browser)


I do not think that html & Co is at this moment adequate for long
mathematical texts. Short abstract may be another matter

You can try dvisvga:

  Description: dvi viewer for SVGAlib
   dvisvga is a screen-previewer for .dvi-files compiled by TeX. It lets you
   see what your printed output will look like. You can choose between a
   black-and-white representation and greyscaling. You can choose an arbitrary
   zoom factor (at some cost of performance). You can set marks to measure
   distances. You can search for text strings. You may visit lots of DVI files,
   set bookmarks and get them saved to a startup-file. dvisvga does not
   support pxl-files. dvisvga ignores all 'special'-commands and has no
   font-replacing mechanism.

However, that will be full-screen, the "split-screen" approach won't
work.

Hi Phil,
please excuse the late response, I had, and still have, some problems
with my computer.

It's good that you are familiar with plain TeX and TeX primitives.
LaTeX and Context provide convenient user interfaces but these are
only wrappers.  Let's ignore them ATM.

The only way to specify a font in plain TeX is to specify the name of
the .tfm file:

   \font\rm=cmr10

   (means: load cmr10.tfm) 

This means that each real or virtual font needs its own .tfm file.
It's not sufficient to create a new virtual font.  You have to create
a new .tfm file too, otherwise the virtual font won't be accessible. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] Difficulty with using PCTeX to compile a .txt file in
	Unicode
Message-ID: <2DDF1BE603234776960CA0D5A6EBFF0C@PDQUAD>

Dear Sir/Madam:

Recently, I have developed a way to make typing a TeX style document 
relatively easy.
I did that by using the facility Autocorrect in Microsoft
WORD.

This allows me to write the command for say an integral with both upper and
lower limit by simply typing (in WORD) int; or alpha by typing a2, or beta 
by typing b2, or prime by typing  pr etc. When you do that in WORD the 
augmented Autocorrect facility will type in the document \int or \alpha, or 
\beta  or \prime etc.
When the typing of TeX style file  is completed I use the Save As command in 
WORD. But the options
I am offered do not allow me to use this file in PCTeX to produce a dvi or 
pdf  file.

The only version I see in the Save As dialog box, that preserves the 
appearance of the file, and which I have used,  is Unicode, which lists the 
file as xxx.txt.

However, when I try to use this file on PCTeX I see on screen  a file all of 
whose entries are nulled and the program cannot use it to produce dvi or 
pdf..
Is there a solution to this problem? It seems there must be.
Thank you
P.J. Dhrymes.

P.S. I attach a small file produced as I have explained, typed on WORD and 
saved as Unicode.

I don't use PCTeX (nor Windows or Word), but on a Mac BBEdit  
identifies your file as UTF-16 Little-Endian, with Windows line  
endings (CRLF). Is there a way that Word could save it as UTF-8  
instead? Maybe that could work.

Or why don't you try TeXmaker?:

http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/

I think you can use its many buttons as you're using your autocorrect  
shortcuts.

Best,

Axel

Yes, that part I understand : but if you remember, the query
started with the naming conventions for the Adobe base 35
font TFMs -- for any given font (say, Adobe Times Roman),
there are a large number (six or seven) TFMs, each with
a subtle variant in the name.  So I was assuming (perhaps
wrongly) that there already exist TFMs for the Adobe base
35 fonts collated in the TeX collating sequence (modulo
the missing characters, for which nothing can be done),
and that in order to use these successfully (once I
had identified which TFM corresponded most closely to
(say) ArborText's "PSMTIMR" (PostScript Mapped Times Roman),
all I would then need to do was to create a VP (and thence
VF) to let PdfTeX make use of this.

But I may well be wrong : I often am :-)

I must admit that I became curious if my preferred editor (= Scite) 
would work with Unicode? It does. As the editor has also a file 
(Options -> Open Abbreviations file) to register abbreviations I can 
only recommend to forget WORD for the work described below.
hh

PS: Samples for Scite abbreviations:
int=\\int_{|}^{}
bd=\\begin{displaymath|}
displaymath=equation
equation=eqnarray
eqnarray=eqnarray*
eqnarray=displaymath

The last part (input: bd) gives you the possibility to start with 
\begin{displaymath}, then just by typing "return"you can change to 
any of the other possibilites shown in the sample or coming back to 
the first. The \vert-symbol let's you put the cursor at its place.

I have Word for XP and the "save as" dialogue asks me first the file type: I
choose .txt but actually call it, say, myfile.tex,  I then a get another
dialogue box that, amongst other things, allows me to choose the encoding,
which I leave as Windows (default) and I don't touch anything else.

The resulting file works just fine with LaTeX.

Yes, of course you're right ---you would have to put

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

in your preamble (is there support for utf16? I don't find anything)

and preferably also

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

out the definition of the macro between

\makeatother
and use the optional argument of pstricks for the color names
(see example)

and you should have a look at pstricks-add, it has better support
for pie charts.

Note that UTF8 is backwards-compatible with ASCII, so if the text is
strictly ASCII saving it as UTF8 will produce an ASCII text file
(except maybe for the dumb BOM on Windows).

While possible (probably), a package would not be sufficient, it would
have to be done at the format file level or (even better) TeX engine
level, because in UTF16 all characters (even ASCII) are at least a
two-byte word.

Subject: [texhax] MakeUppercase with savebox
Message-ID: <6B8196A1-160C-4AB4-85FA-B488E7BC3A54@lx.it.pt>

Hi,

I am having some trouble on doing the following. I would like to make  
command that defines a save box that flushes the text right and make  
it uppercase. I also would like it to accept new lines, so that I  
could issue something like:

\name{This is\\ an example}
\usebox{\mybox}

and it would produce:

             THIS IS
AN EXAMPLE

(it is supposed to be aligned in the right).

I have use the following definitions:

\newcommand{\name}[1]{\mycommand{#1}}

\newsavebox{\mybox}

\newcommand{\mycommand}[1]{%
\savebox{\mybox}{
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}\begin{flushright} \MakeUppercase{#1}\end 
{flushright}
	\end{minipage}
}}

Why can't I use this with linebreaks? Without them it works... or  
without MakeUppercase I can have the line breaks...
Can anyone have any clue?

Best regards,
Jo?o

That is the case with Dhrymes' sample file, identified by BBEdit as  
UTF-16 Little-Endian.

quite sure of the concept of negative spacing, so any furhter 
clarification would be much appreciated.
Incidentally, the above demos were inspired by Knuth's TeXBook. He 
uses \thinspace between the single and double quote marks but if you 
say the gap is too large then ...

For example, with some fonts, between a ^{\circ}, for degrees, and a  
comma or dot (but not colon or semicolon): $180^{\circ}$\finoneg.

It was Reinhard Kotucha who said that in

\thinspace looked to him too large. I think it depends on each font  
design ---with some fonts it might look OK; with other fonts maybe a  
thinner space might be necessary; and perhaps with another font no  
thin space is required at all.

I remember a long discussion about it in the MinionPro mailing list. I  
tried the examples presented with InDesign, and discovered that the  
cases some people were complaining about looked the same in InDesign  
as in LaTeX; so it was the original design of the font, not the  
metrics created by the MinionPro project people.

Best,

Axel

         Paul: In which case the question is, what class of fonts 
would suit what sort of spacing, or are there too many to list?

If getting the right font and kerning combinations relies essentially 
on one's ability to "see", then what alternative would the list recommend?

Many thanks

This is one of the most interesting (and stimulating)
questions I have ever encountered, because it challenges
the very way in which I think about typography.

As someone who is in the privileged position of being
able to see, there are many many elements of fine tuning
that I make to a document before I consider it finally
ready for release.  In fact, I think if you ask Frank
Mittlebach, he will tell you that in preparing the LaTeX
series of books, the 10% that is the fine-tuning actually
requires 90% of the total time.  Now your question -- which
I think is a very reasonable one -- is "could someone
who cannot see perform this fine-tuning ?", and if (as
I suspect) the answer to that is "probably not", then
"what additional  steps could such a person take in order
to ensure that no fine-tuning is actually needed ?".

The answer to the latter question seems to me to be at the
heart of the matter.  In practice, if fine-tuning is to be
avoidable, then every step of the process has to be very
carefully automated, and the person responsible for each
element has to ensure that his or her contribution can be
used without any need to visually check the result.  Let
me give an example.  Suppose you were writing a book,
and you wanted to typeset the following passage of
dialogue :

<example>
     \parindent = 0 em
     \parskip = 1 ex
     \hsize = 16,5 pc

     Jill said, somewhat casually,
     ``I was having lunch today at `Pod Samsonek'''.

     ``What?'', Jim interrupted,  ```Pod Samsonek'
     as in the famous Warszawa restaurant?!''
     \end
</example>

The result of typesetting this passage in TeX is not
only ugly, it's actually wrong : TeX interprets the
sequence of three consecutive closing quotation marks
as meaning <close double quotes><close single quotes>
whereas the author actually intended (and required)
the converse.

Therefore, to mark up such passages successfully, it
is necessary to augment the low-level markup with one
or more macros, the function of which is to clarify
the semantic nature of the markup and thereby to
ensure that the results are as intended.  This can
be accomplished as follows :

<example>
     \parindent = 0 em
     \parskip = 1 ex
     \hsize = 16,5 pc

     \def \lq  {{`}}
     \def \rq  {{'}}
     \def \lqq {{``}}
     \def \rqq {{''}}

     Jill said, somewhat casually,
     \lqq I was having lunch today at \lq Pod Samsonek\rq \rqq.

     \lqq What?\rqq, Jim interrupted,  \lqq \lq Pod Samsonek'
     as in the famous Warszawa restaurant?!\rq \rqq
     \end
</example>

This generates semantically correct output, but many would
argue that it still leaves something to be desired.  For
example, the spacing between consecutive quotation marks
could be increased, tall punctuation (such an the interrogative
and exclamation marks) set off by a small amount of white
space and so on.

Rather than having to do this laboriously throughout the
text, the obvious step would be to introduce a little
AI[1] into the code.  The \lq, \lqq, \rq and \rqq macros
could use look-ahead to see if each is followed by another
of the family, and if so, some additional spacing introduced.
The interrogative and exclamation marks could be made
active, and could similarly become self-spacing.

But there is an alternative.  Remember that, within
a single font, kerning (the choice of spacing between
consecutive glyphs) is a function of the font.  It would
therefore be possible to implement a so-called /virtual/
font that performs the same tasks as the macros and
active characters of the preceding paragraph.  Since
virtual fonts "know" what glyphs follow, all possible
combinations can be specified and optimised for spacing.

But ultimately, no matter how one attempts to automate
the task, the final decision is /essentially/ a visual
one : I do not think that AI and AT[2] have yet advanced
to the point where someone who cannot see can be
/certain/ that the spacing of a document is absolutely
optimal, since the whole purpose of the spacing is
to provide visual cues and clues for a sighted reader.
Yes, Beethoven composed amazing music even when he was
almost totally deaf, but for many deaf people, that
would be a nigh-impossible task.  And I suspect (with
sadness) that the same is probably true for typography :
because it is intended to communicate /visually/, it is
very hard indeed for a person who cannot see to produce
results that cannot be improved, although if the typesetting
engine, macros and fonts have all been designed perfectly,
then the achievable results will almost certainly be more
than acceptable to 99,9% of the readers.

It sounded good to me too.  So I downloaded it and tried it -- works fine
on small tex files, but when I tried it on 'real' files it results in a
segmentation fault.  Do others also have this experience?

In general, yes.  Obviously the best thing to do is to cut your file
in half successively to locate the problem.  (Each 50% cut tells you
one bit of information as to the position.  :-)

But be sure that both files run cleanly in LaTeX alone, that could be
a problem if they don't.

Message-ID: <04601150-15FD-40DB-8A29-CD0D64575E6F@gmail.com>

Hi all.

I've ran into a strange problem with \includegraphics. If I pass any  
parameters to it, it renders the parameters, not the image. That is:

\includegraphics[width=0.5]{logo.eps}
renders text width=0.5

\includegraphics[scale=10]{logo.eps}
renders text scale=10

\includegraphics[height=5cm]{logo.eps}
renders text height=5cm

\includegraphics{logo.eps}
renders the image


It doesnt matter if I try to include eps or png or jpg.

I'm at loss here, can't understand why this happens :)   It used to  
work perfectly ok until a did a clean OS (MacOS Snow Leopard)  
reinstall and installed latest TexLive.

Does anyone have any idea why this might be happening?

Please post a full example (starting with \documentclass and ending

Hi folks
Is there a specific style, in LaTeX, that the list would recommend 
for typsetting a name at the bottom of a letter or a receipt where 
one could put one's siganture?

Thanks

Indeed, clean forgot about that :)

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

	\usepackage[english,russian,turkish]{babel}

	\usepackage{pstricks}
	\usepackage{pstricks-add}
	\usepackage{graphicx}


	\begin{document}
		\includegraphics[width=5cm]{logo.eps}
	\end{document}


Oddly enough, babel seems to interfere. Commenting babel out makes the  
image appear.


The log shows no errors whatsoever. There's only one warning for the  
minimal example: No input encoding specified for Russian language.

It's not Babel, it's /Turkish/ Babel !  Try the following --

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

     \usepackage
         [
             english,
             russian,
%            turkish
         ]
         {babel}

     \usepackage{pstricks}
     \usepackage{pstricks-add}
     \usepackage{graphicx}


     \begin{document}
         \includegraphics[width=5cm]{logo.eps}

Spot on! Turkish causes the problem. Thank you!

Hm, now I'm wondering why this is the case :) I don't really need  
Turkish right now, but I may in the future...

Turkish makes the "=" active. So normally you would get a lot of
errors because of the =. But one of the pstricks packages loads
xkeyval which sanitze the catcodes in key-val list, but now
something else seems to fail. But you can use \shorthandoff:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[turkish]{babel}
\usepackage{xkeyval}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}
\shorthandoff{=}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{tiger}

\end{document}

There's a standard document class called letter, which has macros for
this sort of thing.  It's documented at
<http://www.tug.org/texmf-dist/doc/latex/base/letter.pdf>.

graphicx


The problem has been solved. It was caused by \include[turkish]{babel}
It can be solved by placing \shorthandoff{=} right after \begin 
{document} (see Ulrike Fischer's comment earlier in this thread)

Subject: [texhax] DevanagariTeX 2.14.1 and Pagenumbering
Message-ID: <1256656838.4ae70fc6b200f@webmail.mun.ca>

I recently upgraded to MiklTeX 2.8 and installed DevanagariTeX 2.14.1.
When I use the preamble
\renewcommand\thepage{{\dn\dnnum \arabic{page}}}
to invoke pagenumberings in Devanagari, and then
LaTeX (pdfLaTeX) the file, I get an error message
!Illegal parameter number in definition of \HyPL at Prefix
and the program refuses to create DVI (PDF) file. 
This error was not there in my old system with MikTeX 2.5 and 
DevanagariTeX 2.14, where everything worked smooth.
Is there a bug in the DevanagariTeX 2.14.1 while invoking Devanagari
page numbers?

Also, if I delete the above command, and if I use hyperref, then
the Table of Contents get messed up.  What is the remedy?

Message-ID: <007201ca5712$706649a0$5132dce0$@edu>

Hi, 

I'm not sure if I am writing to the correct recipient, but I am trying to
find a course in using LaTeX; specifically to create statistics-heavy
presentations (tables, graphs, data plots, some equations). I know this is a
narrow request, so perhaps an introductory course would be easier to locate.
I see that TUG has a yearly conference and that the next one is in June 2010
in San Francisco. As a neophyte to the programming language, I don't know if
this conference will be too advanced, or if introductory material is
available there. Also, I'd like to find something a bit sooner than seven
months from now, but google searching has not been terribly useful in
finding any classes/courses/seminars, etc. 

 

Thank you for taking the time to read this; I hope to hear from you soon. If
you do not have an answer, but know who I can contact (or where on the
internet to look), I would be happy for that information as well.

Well, there is a list of consultants here:
http://www.tug.org/consultants.html.  Unfortunately I do not see
anybody close to Michigan there.  

I myself sometimes teach courses like this.  If you wish, we can
organize a telecom class using, for example, Skype.

Tomek,

Some institutions have internal courses for LaTeX, but there are quite  
a few online tutorials, books, etc. and of course there are the  
mailing lists for when you can't find the answer elsewhere.

1. Get George Gratzer's book "More Math into LaTeX". It covers all the  
aspects you referred to.
2. Get the LaTeX Companion, 2nd ed.
3. There are some online tutorials at

Hi Tomek,

    I see that TUG has a yearly conference and that the next one is in
    June 2010 in San Francisco. As a neophyte to the programming
    language, I don't know if this conference will be too advanced, or
    if introductory material is available there. 

I expect there will be material at all levels; there always is.  We
always offer a one-day introductory-to-intermediate LaTeX workshop.
This year it will be on the second day (Tuesday, June 29), and it'll be
possible to sign up just for that, if you wish.

    Also, I'd like to find something a bit sooner than seven months from

In addition to Boris's reply, you might check around with the UMich math
and computer science depts.  Perhaps they have a small seminar on
(La)TeX; some universities do that for their students.

Thanks for writing,
Karl

Besides the two books Alan recommended, which are my constant  
references in my work, and the excellent TUG India tutorials, I would  
advice you first to take a look at lshort.pdf here:

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/

and then, for what I understand of your needs, Dr. Nicola Talbot's  
amazing datatool package (which, I must confess, I haven't used yet);  
see datatool.pdf:

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/datatool/

It uses internally another LaTeX package, which I use constantly:  
TikZ; see examples of it here:

http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/

LaTeX learning curve is steep, but, no doubt, worthwhile.


Best,

Axel

I'm unfamiliar with both tex and latex. Should my time better spent on
learning tex or latex?  Presumably learning curve of tex is even more
steeper than that of latex, but I saw some forum members said they use
plain tex.  I would like to know before deciding,

1. Do common packages such as supertabular and cjk work on tex?
2. Some said latex is actively developing while tex is not, is that
   true?
3. What will be the advantage of plain tex over latex?

They are not divorced however.

Alan Litchfield gave you one answer, which is the one most often 
offered.  I have for years disagreed.
LaTeX, which began as a clone of Brian Reid's Scribe based on the TeX 
typesetting engine (this is not always acknowledged, but is obvious from 
the terminology) has metastasized into a collection of often 
well-designed routines, which are accessible only through a sort of C++ 
syntax that I, for one, but not the only one, find bewildering.  LaTeX 
commands ofter run you through 5  or more parameters that I simply have 
not the patience to deal with.  My basic problem with LaTeX is that it 
has a genius for making simple things complex, and does so at every 
possible instance.

It is nonsense to speak of LaTeX as developing, while TeX is not.  LaTeX 
is a macro package built on top of TeX.  It can not "develop" in the 
sense of altering the basic engine, because Donald Knuth has taken great 
care to ensure archival compatibility for all input files that ever ran 
in TeX3.  If a package requires something that cannot be run in the 
basic TeX3 engine, it may not be called TeX.

The fine tuning that is possible in a macro package based on plain TeX 
may be possible in LaTeX, but LaTeX, for its own protection, shuts off 
many avenues for such fine tuning, or at best, disguises them so 
thoroughly that you will have real difficulty discovering how to walk 
down them.

The model for LaTeX has become the "black box", all too like Microsoft.  
Because it is released under GPL or similar provisions, the basic source 
code is always available, and that is a very good thing, but I have used 
plain TeX since 1984, and written pages of routines to do finely 
adjusted formating which I use for publication in academic journals, and 
it is not clear to me that the documentation model for LaTeX is 
seriously better than the comments in my macro package.
I can rarely understand what LaTeX docs are saying, owing to the C++ 
syntax that runs throughout them.

If you are satisfied with LaTeX formating, you should probably go with 
it.  I think it is often slovenly, and though I am assured that, since 
LaTeX is ultimately built on top of plain TeX, it would be possible to 
get rid of the slovenliness, I have never thought that I had the time to 
put into that.

Finally, the advantage of plain.tex over LaTeX is that you remain in 
control.  With LaTeX, you are left in a position that is far too like 
what Microsoft Word offers you: "We know better than you do what you 
want"---again with the important proviso that you are always free to 
read all the source macros of LaTeX, but that is never the case for the 
source code of Word.

Hi Pierre,

Well, as I said, it was my opinion and maybe it was not yours but I  
never said it was. I also said that the OP's mileage might vary from  
mine.

Gosh, thanks. But I will anyway and probably regardless of any  
conditions you deem it necessary for me to proceed. I do not feel it  
necessary to read all source macros. ;)

Dear Pierre,

thanks for your post that is an really interesting aspect. I would be 
interested in some examples 1 to 1 where LaTeX is somehow more difficult or more 
complex to use compared to TeX. Really, no offending just like to see where is 
the differences.

Beside the fact that I believe it is pretty unfair to compare LaTeX to MS Word 
;) you self said LaTeX based on TeX thus, even if you are right and it really 
makes things more "out of control" ... finally it is still TeX right ?! ;)

Let me add another point....

you said you work with TeX since 1984 (impressive date to start with some 
computer skills :) the big brother is watching you). Maybe during your 
education people were still concerned about type-setting and layout-rules. 
Together with your really impressive time of experience with TeX this might 
result that you are very well aware of all kind of typesetting rules and 
regulations.

However, we have to face that most newcomers had to grow up with MS-Word in 
school. There is no need to say that this is a very very said situation. 
School should teach generic typesetting and layout rules and not using a 
proprietary product sponsored by an aggressive lobby with million of dollars 
to bring it down into the schools ready to make the rest of the world forever 
depending on there products.

However, I believe that if you use, as a absolute beginner, LaTeX you might 
loose some of the fine grains of TeX but it also takes a lot of burdens away 
from you. Mostly things a beginner can even not answer if you point him to the 
fact.

Here and in other lists, there are more and more questions of this type
In MS-Word the .... but in TeX/LaTeX it is .... why ?
And mostly the answer to those questions has to be... because MS Word is doing 
it wrong resp. ignoring it whereas LaTeX/TeX is taking care of it.
This depict that many beginners have absolutely no idea about a proper page 
layout and proper typesetting rules.  

Would a beginner's pure TeX file not violate many general type-setting and

created by a beginner, right ?

Just my two cents

Almost certainly not.  When one speaks of a package (in this
context), one is almost invariably speaking of a LaTeX package.

LaTeX is being actively developed by the LaTeX 3 team
(Frank Mittelbach, Chris Rowley and many others); TeX
itself is frozen, but variants continue to emerge
(eTeX, PdfTeX, LuaTeX, XeTeX, ...).  However, this is
like comparing chalk and cheese : the real question is
"are new packages for Plain TeX being developed", to
which the answer is almost certainly "no" (even I, who
work almost entirely in Plain TeX, do not write "packages"
in the strict sense of the word (well, not any more);
rather, I develop solutions to whatever problems I currently
face, and then (sometimes) present those solutions at
conferences).

> 3. What will be the advantage of plain tex over latex?

There are a number of advantages, and some disadvantages.

Advantages :

1) You get to understand how TeX works, at a really deep level.

2) You have the freedom to express your ideas exactly as you
    choose -- if you don't like the "backslash and brace"
    convention, you can design/implement/use another (say,
    an SGML/XML-like syntax, for example)

3) You are in complete control : if something doesn't work
   (or doesn't work as you would wish it), you can fix it
   (or at least try to fix it !).

4) You are forced to THINK.  LaTeX tries to spoon-feed you
    canned solutions; with Plain TeX, there are no canned
    solutions -- everything you want to eat, you have to
    hunt, shoot, butcher and cook for yourself (or forage,
    gather and cook, if you happen to be a vegetarian).


Disadvantages :

1) You cut yourself off from the incredibly wide range of
    LaTeX packages that have already been written.  Even I,
    who am a died-in-the-wool Plain TeX aficionado, have been
    extremely impressed with the range and quality of these
    packages, which can -- used intelligently -- much simplify
    the more routine typesetting tasks.

2) You need document design skills.  Although it could hardly
    be claimed that out-of-the-box LaTeX output is beautiful,
    it does at least heed the more important design considerations.


I was surprised when I got this far that I could find only two
disadvantages to the use of Plain TeX; I had genuinely thought
that the number of advantages and disadvantages would be of
the same order of magnitude.  Perhaps my problem is that
I continue to see Plain TeX through rose-coloured glasses,
although I have recently come to accept that IF (big IF)
I am prepared to work within the LaTeX framework, there is
a large corpus of extant material on which I can call.
Unfortunately I always think of LaTeX as a nanny-like figure
who takes great care to protect little Johnny from all the
nasty things that lurk in the grown-ups' world of Real TeX [tm],
but who as an unfortunate side-effect stultifies his powers
of expression, and forces him to think like "all the other
nice little boys and girls that listen to their nannies".

One last analogy : Plain TeX is to assembly language as
LaTeX is to Cobol.  That probably sums it up, although
the assembly language is far closer to Macro-32 in its
expressiveness than it is to more primitive assembly languages.

Dear Frederik,

This is what I get too for  latexdiff pap7.tex pap7.tex > pap7-diff.tex
But did you try it removing line 635?  That is the line
%%%%%%%%    }           ADDING THIS LINE PREVENTS segmentation fault in latexdiff
If I remove that line I get the segmentation fault.

Cheers, Wes

Subject: [texhax] Plain vs. Latex
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0910280630080.17263@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

I would like to add my 2c to what Pierre MacKay and others have said. 
Let me begin by pointing out that nearly all of plain can also be used in 
latex.  There are exceptions, but not many and mostly not important and 
you can always add them to your own file of macros.  This is not true of 
amslatex, incidentally, which has gone to a lot of trouble to make it 
quite difficult, although not impossible, to use plain macros.  I don't 
understand their philosophy, but then that was why I quit the organization 
40 years ago.

If you look at my papers, they are nominally latex (and indeed the journal 
I do the tex editing for accepts on latex), but you see plenty of what is 
obviously plain tex in them.  For example, I detest the 
\newcommand/\renewcommand idea and never use anything but \def and \let 
(the latter doesn't even exist in latex) and latex never complains.  I 
generally avoid using \begin{xxx} and \end{xxx} pairs, although sometimes 
the replacement \xxx, \endxxx don't work the same and I have never 
understood why.  I hate the multiply nested braces that latex 
recommends (but doesn't enforce) and use braces only when necessary.  My 
diagram macros (and indeed the xy-pic they are based on) run fine in both 
plain and latex.  Although it would probably be possible to program them 
in orthodox latex, it would be much harder and why bother?

Someone was asking about a package to do memorandums in latex when he had 
a macro package in plain tex that worked.  Not one respondent thought to 
suggest that he try to just include the plain package--it would likely 
work fine.  Sometimes, I get criticized in my postings because I use \def 
in latex or do some other non-orthodox thing.  As though latex were a 
religion, not a tool.

There are certainly things that latex does well.  Things like setting up 
the first page of a paper are easy in latex.  Font handling, once you get 
past the woeful documentation is much easier and I use nothing else. 
Things like lists are well-done and I use them.

Incidentally, I have always made sure I keep a copy of Lamport's original 
latex package as it provides an awful lot of useful documentation that 
latex 2e, for all its advantages, does not provide.  Latex 2e has a 
priesthood and woe betide someone who wants to figure it out for himself. 
(Okay, I exaggerate.)  Incidentally, I once had a bit of correspondence 
with Leslie Lamport and he certainly approved of how I was mixing plain 
and latex.

Another advantage to learning both plain and latex is that you will then 
get and use The TeXBook and actually learn something of the innards of
tex.

I have had intimations that latex 3 will go to some lengths to leave plain 
definitely behind.  It will leave me behind too.

Subject: [texhax] texmf.cnf problem for DevanagariTeX in Ubuntu904/Texlive
Message-ID: <1256732414.4ae836fea9f82@webmail.mun.ca>

I use Texlive that is bundled with Ubuntu 9.04 with the texmf root
directory residing at /usr/share/texmf.  I wanted to install DevanagariTeX2.15,
whose filesystem confirms to TDS.  The instruction that comes with the README
file is  is to edit the texmf.cnf file (in web2c directory)
and modify the TEXMF variable. Insert the line  
    DEVNAG = /path/to/velthuis
and then modify the TEXMF definition as:
    TEXMF = {!!$DEVNAG,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN}
Rebuild the file database.

When I do exactly as above, nothing happens and  kpathsea library is not finding
the files. On looking at the texmf.cnf file in /texmf/web2c,
I find the following precautions at the very beginning of the file:

% This file is automatically generated by update-texmf
% PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY. It is meant to be generated from
% files in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/.
% While changes made by users will not be overwritten, they will cause
% you trouble. You will be shown the differences between the edited and
% the newly created file. We will try to merge our and your changes, but
% that might not always work, and you will probably have to edit again.
% Therefore, if you want a smooth upgrade, please edit the files
% in /etc/texmf/texmf.d,
% or create an additional one (with the extension '.cnf'),
% and invoke update-texmf.

What does this mean?  Am I not allowed to edit and change the texmf.cnf
file, and in that case, how can I accomplish the changes need to install
DevanagariTeX?  Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

TeX is what LaTeX2e and earlier versions are written in.

Quite often, if one gets beyond what can be done by just loading a  
package, one will need to program in TeX, and there are a number of  
parts of LaTeX where one has to use Plain TeX constructs 'cause LaTeX  
constructs are dis-allowed (the picture environment comes to mind).  
LaTeX offers a richer, more consistent programming environment, but  
the rules on when one needs to use Plain TeX constructs aren't clearly  
defined, and I've not been able to discern any consistency beyond when  
stuff stops working.

Using LaTeX allows one access to LaTeX packages and it's rare to have  
a problem which hasn't been anticipated and solved by a package.

I've done lots of books where all that I had to do to match the  
designer's book format was load the appropriate packages and set their  
options correctly.

If one uses Plain TeX one has to ``roll one's own''.

Here's an excellent post by David Kastrup which discusses this in a  
wider context:

It is my (strictly personal) impression, that the general use of 
LaTeX  also includes the loss of knowledge how things are done in 
plain TeX.
Many times people look for a package when in reality they would just 
need one macro (of a limited number of lines). But they are (often) 
not able to extract the macro from a package because that most times 
implies some knowledge of plain TeX.

You can't read your way through this decision; you have to try something out. 
Where you begin may depend on your background: programming/mathematics 
versus WYSIWYG.  But either way, you'll need to practice on something that 
eventually makes the TeX/LaTeX distinctions concrete.  If you can't complete a 
project at all, then neither TeX nor LaTeX is helpful. 

So find a project.  At some point you'll need something from the dark side 
(LaTeX, or TeX, depending).  I've started with LaTeX, and now want to modify 
macros, but can't yet decipher the underlying TeX commands in the 
documentation.  I always find LaTeX documentation clear until I read the 
commands underlying the LaTeX macros.  But it's fine; my project will get done.  
Web-based support for LaTeX is remarkably good, as are the standard books.

Knuth himself is one of the clearest explainers of his own work - he deserves 
more recognition in book history circles than he's getting right now.  Whatever 
you do, read the TeXbook while you do it.

macros submitted by authors.  the latex
packages spoken of provide the necessary
uniformity while enabling generation of
identical versions in both print and
electronic form, the latter with full
hyperlinking provided by hyperref.

with books, more flexibility is possible,
and authors can submit their files using
ams-tex (a structured interface to tex

latex, or even plain tex, preferably
using an author package that provides
the "look" of the particular series in

person who has the duty of answering
tex-related questions for authors, i
definitely appreciate it when authors
follow our guidelines.  we do receive
a number of books that have been written
to some latex document class other than
one from ams, and it usually requires
many hours of technical effort to adapt
these styles to the local requirements,
which include such basic things as
making sure the text block fits in the
specified margins so printed material
isn't either cut off at the outside
trim or made unreadable in the binding
gutter.  (the number of authors who
modify the page size to fill a sheet
of letter paper is truly staggering;
i know many authors refuse to read
instructions -- they're brazen enough

at a copy of the journal or book
series to which they're submitting
their manuscript, it should be obvious
that a text block that fills a letter
sized sheet just won't fit withint
the trim of the target publication.)

more time spent by the publisher means
higher cost.  while it may seem shameful
to push this work onto authors, it's a
fact that an author understands the
material better than any editorial
person or texnician, so a careful and
responsible author can help to ensure
both a valuable document and an
affordable price.

the bottom line for the person who originally
asked is, choose plain tex or latex as you
find you prefer, but if you're submitting
a manuscript for publication, please read
what the publisher recommends and follow
these instructions.

I don't disagree with what you write.  As I said, the journal I help edit 
uses latex excusively--in fact latex 2e.  Where I part company is with 
people who criticize me for not using "pure" latex.  My gripe with the AMS 
is that they disable standard tex things to no particular purpose.  I have 
a book that was published in an AMS series (the Centre de Recherche de 
Montreal series, to be exact).  When I wrote it I had no particular 
publisher in mind and I made extensive use of the plain \matrix macro.  I 
was familiar with it and it was easy to use.  When it was accepted by the 
CRM, I tried putting it in amslatex.  I had no gripe with the style specs 
(well one, I had used \raggedright, which the AMS wouldn't accept--ok, it 
that's they way they are, I can live with it.  But the \matrix macro, 
which I included since it is not in latex, just caused an error message. 
Eventually I was able to get amslatex to accept it.  But I certainly 
wasn't going to redo 224 matrices just because someone at the AMS decided 
that Knuth's macros weren't good enough.  It is that attitude, "My way or 
the highway" that I am objecting to.

LaTeX is a script-like user interface to the binary TeX program, i.e., 
Knuth's versions up to TeX3, or extensions of the latter, most notably: 
e-TeX, pdfTeX, XeTeX.

Plain TeX is kind of an alternative user interface to TeX, but with a few 
exceptions, it is just a part of LaTeX. ... "in a silent way", however: 
plain TeX code is present in the LaTeX source latex.ltx, but usual LaTeX 
documentation doesn't mention it. Plain TeX and LaTeX are called "formats".

When you are writing `tex', it is not quite clear whether you are referring 
to the binary or to the format Plain TeX. This confusion seems to lurk in 
other postings.

Books like The TeXbook or TeX for the Impatient describe the binary engine 
as well as the Plain TeX format, both is missing in usual LaTeX documentation.

If you start learning TeX from the TeXbook or so, you will need quite a 
while until you can typeset a paper or a thesis. If you start with some 
small LaTeX introduction, you can typeset a paper or thesis almost 
immediately. At least you get a proper looking output for mere text soon. 
You can typeset one or a few pages of an introduction for your first work 
within a few days. While you are proceeding and want to add some more 
special features, you can go on reading extra documentation, each bit just 
for the next task.

This is the basic idea of LaTeX! Get something proper without learning much!

>3. What will be the advantage of plain tex over latex?

After a while, you may observe behaviour of LaTeX that seems strange to 
you. LaTeX moreover, gives very limited access to the features of the TeX 
engine. This is just due to the effiency idea of LaTeX. When most urgent 
things have been done and you can afford spending some time learning about 
what is behind LaTeX and what TeX really offers, you may buy a book like 
The TeXbook. This may help you in understanding difficulties with LaTeX, 
why you need some extra packages for certain fine tuning, you may then mix 
Plain TeX code into your LaTeX code for fine tuning, you can write your own 
LaTeX packages getting more control of TeX ...

>1. Do common packages such as supertabular and cjk work on tex?

They work when you use the TeX engine with the LaTeX format. They usually 
don't with Plain TeX only (running the TeX engine). miniltx.tex can extend 
Plain TeX so some more packages that usually are "LaTeX" packages can be used.

Well, some call obvious truths "nonsense", maybe thinking `don't waste your 
time with saying things that everybody knows' (not saying this outright 
instead of just thinking, probably they consider it too obvious to waste 
their time with also saying it).

Knuth's TeX3 engine does not develop anymore, due to Knuth's decision.

What may not be called TeX?

I mentioned extensions of TeX like e-TeX, pdfTeX, XeTeX. There are LaTeX 
packages that require running such an extension of the TeX program. Their 
development may not have stopped as definitely as TeX's, but this point is 
quite irrelevant.

>2. Some said latex is actively developing while tex is not, is that true?

Considering the confusion of `TeX' with `plain TeX', a point in saying this 
is that many people work on improving LaTeX by either improving the 
standard macros or by writing own LaTeX packages for new features, and by 
improving their own packages. There seems to be almost no development of 
Plain TeX in this sense.

However, I tend to say it is "nonsense" to consider this point, or it is 
irrelevant. At least, it is not a reason not to learn Plain TeX when you 
master LaTeX. In order to improve LaTeX or use of some TeX binary engine, 
you must understand Plain TeX, the TeX engine, considerable parts of the 
TeXbook, even if it is "not actively developing" in some sense.

I agree, but still learning using the TeX engine should start with LaTeX; 
later a user may learn about TeX and Plain TeX. I have never heard that 
when a TeX user starts learning LaTeX, she must swear never to touch the 
TeXbook.

True. But I do not know much of my car and drive it nonetheless. I would
not be able to build an oven or a washing machine, and use them still.
OK, once they fail, I need help. But they help me greatly even without me
knowing each of their parts by heart.

I am a long time user of LaTeX and use it intensely for a lot of quite
different things. And the approach of "try with LaTeX, but keep an open eye
for plain TeX solutions" works quite well for me. I do not see much sense
in re-inventing the wheel.

Mind, I am glad there are people who understand those things in detail.
The machines, and LaTeX, would not exist without such people. I am grateful
for all their expertise. I just think that you do not *need* to understand
all the details if you just need to use the machine. And the machine called
LaTeX still offers a lot of flexibility, so I think most users never really
collide with LaTeX's restrictions.

Well, at the risk of getting slightly off-topic, I fear that
here we must differ.  Whilst I accept that it is not essential
to know exactly how every last component in your car (or mine)
was constructed, and exactly how it functions, if you (or I)
do not understand the torque characteristics of our engine,
or understand why there is both a lower bound and an upper bound
on the rotational speed of the engine, and why there are
different values for these depending on engine loading, if we
do not understand under-steer and over-steer, and why one tries
to accelerate out of corners, then can we ever really drive
/properly/, with all the concomitant benefits that proper
driving brings (extended engine life, extended drive-train
life, extended tyre life, decreased running costs, increased
safety, and so on) ?

I think the same holds true for TeX : yes, (almost) anyone
can use LaTeX, but to use LaTeX /properly/, and to get maximum
benefit from it, one does need to know what is taking place
inside (that is, in the underlying TeX typesetting engine).
No, it won't last any longer, and in general a crash won't
be fatal, but if you /do/ know what's taking place inside,
you stand a better chance of being able to do at least a
little of your own maintenance and tuning, when things aren't
behaving quite as you might wish.

But that basic monolithic engine and its carefully constructed collection of beautiful but bizarre basic assumptions, limitations, overloadings, quasi-optimisations (need I go on?) has been precisiely the stimulus for major LaTeX kernel developments (and maybe some packages too) over the deacdes.  These have been developed precisely to remove or work-around primitive (in the TeXnical sense) many of TeX's severe limitaions and quirks.  Leslie started this process of removing Knuth's more whacky ideas from ever being used by good LaTeX code and some recent experimental stuff devloped by my colleagues turns off a very large
percentage of the algorithms and code in TeX: The Program (to pursue the car-driving analaogy far too far, that's the book for the materials engineers which of course provides masses of useful information about why certain cars have the steering characteristics that are so essential to Phil's driving techniques).  

Thus it is no wonder that us ageing boy-racers who think of themselves as innovative engineers and Formula One studs do not like LaTeX.

If I could be bothered to look them up I would refer to Leslie's car metaphor's from 25 or so years ago.  But I shall simply note that, for cars (at least in Europe), those decades have seen enormous changes: from the most fundamental engineering at the materials science level to the software and sesnsors at the virtual control level and at all levels in between but most importantly the influence of quality and safety engineering.

All these have led me to have no need at all to understand anything at all about how the car sticks to the road, what speed it does, whether the torque is coirrect, whether the lights are on, etc. etc.  Unfortunately I still need to point it in the roughly the rioght direction:-).

Oh, I almost got too distracted: my question/lament is:

Why have the fundamental processes of automated document processing at most levels progressed not at all during that same period?  (I exclude font technologies from this indictment.)

Have fun,  chris

Dear Frederik,

I run on Scientific Linux 5.3, which is a clone of Red Hat Enterprise 5.
The perl version is  v5.8.8 built for i386-linux-thread-multi
latexdiff latexdiff-fast and latexdiff-so all gave the segmentation fault.

I tried doing it also on another machine with a slightly older version of
perl v5.8.5, but with twice the memory.  It also gave the segmentation
fault.

I've played around with the tex file and found that the segmentation fault
could be avoided by adding a comment line -- line 635 of the attached file.
If that line is removed, I get the segmentation fault.

The segmentation fault occurs very quickly, almost immediately. So I think
that latexdiff has not started looking for the differences yet.

I thought that the problem might be misinterpreting a { that was in a
comment, since adding a comment with a } got rid of the segmentation fault.
I attempted to isolate the problem in a small test file, containing only
the \begin{figure} - \end{figure} in which line 635 occurs.  But I did not
get a segmentation fault with or without line 635.
So the problem is more complicated than just the { in a comment.


Another problem, but only a slightly annoying one, is an apparent
misparsing of a line ending in a \
e.g.
  use \ell\
  rather than l to avoid confusion with 1
Apparently the blank after \ell\  is not seen and results in warning
messages.

Further, differences in equations sometimes lead to incorrect mathmode in
the difference file resulting in latex needing to insert a $.

All in all,  latexdiff seems to work well for text, but has some problems
when things get complicated.

pap7-diff.tex seems to contain reasonable output.  Only change to 
pap7.tex is that some newlines get removed. (particularly before 
comments, or where there are multiple newlines)

It is not the perl version either; I ran the same sequence on another 
machine, which has perlv5.8.0, and get the same output as above.  Also 
get the same result with latexdiff-so 0.5, and latexdiff-fast 0.42.

If anyone else is reading this thread, can someone else reproduce?

Your other reported bug (ignores "\ " is a real shortcoming leading to 
the warnings and  I will try to address this in the next version).

The readme file was written before Velthuis Devanagari was included in
TeX Live. Now you have to do it only if you wish to use the latest
package from CVS. I hope that all packages have been converted to
*.deb so that you should have everything. There are just some
improvements concerning Vedic accents that are not yet on CTAN and
thus not on TeX Live.

Hi,

first of all, you are reporting problems with Debian/Ubuntu TeX Live,
so the tex-live list is not the perfect place. Better to use Debian/Ubuntu
specific support forums.

Here the development of TeX Live itself is done, not the packaging 
for Debian.

There is a Ubuntu group, and a Debian mailing list for that.

Anyway, since it is mostly me being responsible fro Debian packages, see
below for comments.

That is strange. In fact if you do that and call mktexlsr the
files should be found.

When you called mktexlsr did it lists that it updated the DEVNAG tree.

Well that does mean what it is written!!!

texmf.cnf in Debian and thus Ubuntu is managed in two steps:
- first it is recreated from the files in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/
- then user made changes are tried to be merged with ucf

The above description explains where you should make changes.

You also could read
	/usr/share/doc/tex-common/TeX-on-Debian.{pdf,txt,html}
	/usr/share/doc/tex-common/README.Debian.{pdf,txt,html}
	/usr/share/doc/tex-common/ebian-TeX-Policy.{pdf,txt,html}
(in this order it is probably the easiest!)

Thanks.

Best wishes

Norbert

So the tex-live list is probably not the best place. Actually, part of
your problem is specific to the Debian/Ubuntu packaging of TeX Live, and
maybe the other part is general.

You should indeed add $DEVNAG, probably at the beginning. But you
probably have more that just TEXMFLOCAL and TEXMFMAIN. On my Debian
stable machine with texlive-full from Debian, I have:

TEXMF =
{$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFDIST}

> Rebuild the file database.

I didn't test, but I think you should also change TEXMFDBS by adding
$DEVNAG too. Otherwise, mktexlsr will not create a ls-R file in DVENAG.
Or you can omit the !! in front of $DEVNAG in your TEXMF definition, if
the DEVNAG tree is not too big.

I think it is because you have a !! in front of DEVNAG in TEXMF, but no
ls-R at the root.

This is Debian/Ubuntu-specific. Please have a look an man update-texmf
for details.

That the file you are looking at is a generated file. You should edit
the source files in texmf.d and re-generate the file using update-texmf
if you want to avoid problem on update of the Debian packages.

Of course I did.

I think this is getting way out of hand. This discussion started, if I
remember correctly, with someone who wanted to start using the TeX
machinery. He asked whether he should start with LaTeX or plain TeX.

For my taste there were far too many responses stressing the importance of
the underlying TeX. I do not disagree with the authors of those posts
concerning TeX's importance, but I wanted to shed light on the approach of
*starting* with LaTeX. Not even to tell them wrong, just as another
opinion. LaTeX, in my eyes, allows good results with less effort and less
learning than using plain TeX.

I work in a very small firm, and all our correspondence is done using some
kind of TeX. I did the coding for most of the stuff that is used now, and I
chose LaTeX, because I could reuse the work of a lot of people who know
more of the TeX innards than me.

My boss is an assembler type guy. So the plain TeX commands appeal to him.
But he never invested the time to learn about typography. He thinks "I want
to start a new paragraph here and I want it to have some vertical distance
from the previous paragraph" and adds a macro he once created with some
fixed vertical space, without any thought about which kind of vertical
space would be typographically correct at this place.  With his
non-willingness to learn about the underlaying typographical concepts, I
wish he used a more LaTeX kind of approach -- allowing the engine to choose
the correct kind of spacing.

Looking at him, I would tell any beginner to start with LaTeX. You *can* go
into depth (and deep into the innards of TeX) then, but you need not. And
you are less prone to falling into bad programming habits -- especially if
you have to learn from books and internet alone, with no one looking over
your shoulder from time to time.

Believe me, I did not learn much from my theoretical driver's lessons. It
was the practical part, with a real person tutoring me, that taught me how
to drive. Something I sorely miss when learning programming languages...

It's a hard problem, and one which few companies are willing to invest  
in.

Commercial software developers have to sell software which users are  
able to learn, and are willing to use, so one ends up w/ na?ve users  
treating computers are glorified memory typewriters w/ advanced  
features ignored or mis-used.

Software is tested and evaluated in periodicals by journalists who  
find it easier to manage a long list of features and yes / no  
checkboxes than any sort of in-depth evaluation of how a system works  
and can be used most efficiently.

That said, the fundamentals of this are kind of invariant, aren't they?

Typography ultimately devolves to key-value pairs of text and markup  
and how one processes that.

The best markup scheme I've found is TEI: http://www.tei-c.org/ 
index.xml and there're some neat tools for converting that to LaTeX.  
(I hope that there will be some direct integration w/ LaTeX-3?)

An open-ended rant about difficulties in the industry:

  - no way to encode index entries in XML and have them set as such in  
InDesign
  - no flexible space before heads in InDesign w/o resorting to  
scripts which often require manual intervention
  - no way to conditionally insert graphics in InDesign (actually, one  
can't get graphics in when using Adobe Tagged Text and if one uses  
XML, one can't get in index entries, so one has to resort to hybrid  
work-flows and proprietary tools like XTags)
  - tools which focus on allowing the user to do things like  
instantiate 45 different spot colours in a file w/ a single menu  
command rather than automating processing colours, &c. (Adobe  
Illustrator to name names)
  - no way to encode graphic sizes in html using relative sizes (ems)  
when using CSS or any other system I've found
  - RIPs which will not honour a request to provide a .pdf at a  
particular Adobe Acrobat compatibility level

(there, my week in a nutshell)

By contrast, TeX / LaTeX (and ConTeXt and other variants) work, are  
extensible and the only limits to what one can do w/ them are human  
ingenuity and available computer processing power and storage capacity.

Well, dare I suggest that perhaps there was good
reason for that large number of similarly-themed
responses ?

I don't think I would agree with "good results", but
I would have no problem with "adequate".

I sympathise with you.  Someone who sets out to use Plain TeX
without also taking the trouble to try to understand typography
is going to get into deep deep doo-doo.  They will also almost
certainly follow Knuth's style of coding which (sadly) does
almost nothing to separate form from content (\bigskip and
friends are really evil, IMHO).  But if you have someone who
(a) understands (or is willing to learn) typography, and (b)
wishes to write his/her own content-oriented interface to the
TeX primitives, rather than relying on either LaTeX or Plain
TeX, then he/she should be congratulated rather than castigated.

No matter whether someone uses LaTeX or Plain TeX, they /still/
need to have a basic understanding of typography.  If they lack
that (and aren't willing to acquire it), then both LaTeX and
Plain TeX can produce execrable results, but in general LaTeX
is more likely to produce /acceptable/ results in unskilled
hands.  Plain TeX cedes far more control to the user, which
is both a benefit and a risk : for myself, I wish more TeX
users were willing to learn a little about typography and
then develop their own interface(s) to low-level TeX, but
I accept that many (perhaps, sadly, even most) lack the time,
the interest and the inclination so to do.

I came in on this conversation late.  If I am doing computational
mathematics I use various libraries.  I have been known to make some
minor changes to source code in numerical recipes or gsl but, in
general, I do not want to reinvent the wheel.  My attitude to LaTeX is
similar.  I may fine tune something occasionally using a bit of TeX
but I have produced many papers and reports using LaTeX and I am very
happy with what I have done.

Most of the people that I have introduced to TeX would not have the
patience to use the original TeX.. Most of these people would be
working in quantitative economics and would interact with computers
using various specialist packages.  They would have little or no
experience of computer programming languages such as C, Java etc.
LateX would be the only option for them

I have no experience of the Plain TeX format.

I don't understand : I can write

and that will have the apparently desired effect.  What
additional feature(s) are you looking for in contexts

Frederik,   Thanks for looking at this.  So, it appears that if I would
upgrade to the newest perl, I would get a warning message instead of a
segmentation fault.  Unfortunately, that is tricky, since I work on several
computers for which I am not the administrator, and he prefers to wait for
an rpm from Scientific Linux.  Anyway, with the addition of the comment I
avoid the problem for now.  Please inform me when you have a new version of
latexdiff.  And thanks for your interest.

Regards, Wes

I guess I'll need to retract that part of my rant. Last time I tried  
that sort of thing (not in the past week, that just got thrown in that  
list) it simply didn't work --- perhaps it only works w/ certain  
browsers? I'll have to check more thoroughly.

Thanks!

By all means (and perhaps "evil" was a bit strong :-)) --

Let me start by saying that, IMHO, the Plain format is
neither fish nor fowl : it is not a minimal set of
definitions on which a more powerful format could
be layered, nor is it sufficiently powerful in itself
to be used for more than a very small subset of possible
documents.  If it were to set out to be the former,
it would need to do little more initialise catcodes
and provide some basic definitions; if it were to set
out to be the latter, at the very least it would need
to provide an orthogonal font size selection mechanism.
In fact, it does neither.  It provides a lot of
syntactic sugar which is best eschewed, and fails to
address the fundamental problem of wishing to use other
than 10pt as the root font size.

So what's particularly wrong with \bigskip ?  Of itself,
nothing.  Indeed, Don's introduction thereto contains
nothing but good sense.  I quote :-

> Instead of sprinkling various amounts of glue throughout a manuscript, expressing
> each of them explicitly in terms of points, you will find it much better
> to explain your intentions more clearly by typing something like `\smallskip'
> when you want abnormal spacing. The definition of \smallskip can readily

> \TeX also provides you with `\medskip', which is worth two smallskips, and
> `\bigskip', which is worth two medskips.

But what Don fails to do at this point (although it
could be argued that many of his later usages of
\bigskip are intended to illustrate the point) is
to state clearly that THE USE OF \bigskip SHOULD BE
RESTRICTED TO MACRO DEFINITIONS.  Indeed, when he
gives his "Concert" example in Appendix E ("Example
Formats"), he even violates this "rule" himself :-

> \input concert
> \tsaologo
> \medskip
> \centerline{Friday, November 19, 1982, 8:00 p.m.}
> \bigskip
> \centerline{\bf PROGRAM}
> \medskip
> \composition{Variations on a Theme by Tchaikovsky}
> \composer{Anton S. Arensky (1861--1906)}
> \smallskip
> {\medtype
> \movements{Tema: Moderato\cr
> Var.~I: Un poco pi\`u mosso&Var.~V: Andante\cr
> Var.~II: Allegro non troppo&Var.~VI: Allegro con spirito\cr
> Var.~III: Andantino tranquillo&Var.~VII: Andante con moto\cr
> Var.~IV: Vivace&Coda: Moderato\cr}
> }

As a result, almost every beginning Plain TeX user creates
his or her documents on exactly this model :-

 > \tsaologo
 > \medskip
 > \centerline{Friday, November 19, 1982, 8:00 p.m.}
 > \bigskip
 > \centerline{\bf PROGRAM}
 > \medskip
 > \composition{Variations on a Theme by Tchaikovsky}
 > \composer{Anton S. Arensky (1861--1906)}
 > \smallskip

whereas what they should be doing (IMHO, of course)
is creating macros such as \datetime, \heading that
provide a clean separation between content and form.
Indeed, the above example would be ten times better
(IMHO) if Don had written something like :

 > \settsaologo
 > \datetime {Friday, November 19, 1982, 8:00 p.m.}
 > \heading {PROGRAM}
 > \composition {Variations on a Theme by Tchaikovsky}
 > \composer {Anton S.~Arensky (1861--1906)}

where \settsalogo, \datetime, \heading, etc.,
perform all the necessary formatting implicitly,
leaving a cleanly marked-up document with no
expolicit formatting whatsoever.

OK, rant over (as William would say !).  Does this
clarify things, Adam ?

Thank all for valuable inputs.  Originally I wanted to generate
commercial invoice using latex template.  With help from various forum
members, I got an adequate solution (I still wish oval corners for
fbox and tabular).  I think I'll continue to use latex for day work.
Canned package based solutions works quite well if you accept some
minor limitation or annoyance (such as the oval corner, but please let
me know how to do it, if possible).

As I understand, typography is craftsmanship to be acquired by years'
apprenticeship.  Are various typesetting rules for typography already
meant to be in-built inside Tex (binary) or Plain Tex format?  Or it
is only the Latex format provides such help.

I'll learn Plain Tex because it is more challenging.  At any rate,
Latex will be the safety net for $ job.

Nothing at all in the TeX binary that I can think of, Bill
(perhaps someone will correct me), and the Plain format
really addresses only the most basic aspects, such
as setting \baselineskip to 1.2 x <design size of base
font>.  LaTeX goes a lot lot further in trying to
embed basic AI knowledge of typography, but not everyone
agrees that its basic styles demonstrate this very
successfully ...

Or I can correct myself :-)  Of course, the binary sets out
to address (and addresses very well) certain low-level aspects
of typography -- it provides, for example, a first-class
paragraph builder.  So my earlier statement was far too
sweeping.  Perhaps what I should have said is that it
leaves a great deal to the format, but provides an excellent
infrastructure on which formats can build.  Chris Rowley
will now probably want to argue about whether the
infrastructure is "excellent", merely "adequate", or
"lacking in a great deal".  All yours, Chris.

One of the signs of careful composition, whose absence is really painful 
in most LaTeX documents I have seen---painfuleven to those who are 
unaware of the tradition---is the balancing of General Text baselines 
across multicolumn text, across a spread and, in the case of even 
slightly transparent paper, on both sides of a folio.  (I am working on 
a 15th century manuscript that appears to have been personally written 
by Cardinal Bessarion, and it is remarkable how careful he is to match 
the baselines of verso text with those on the recto side.

If you introduce \bigskip, or any other of the skips that includes 
stretchable glue to headers or inserts, you have effectively ensured 
that baselines will never match across multi-column text, spreads or on 
back-to-back recto-verso pairs.

Stretchable vertical glue (which traditionalists will deplore as 
"carding" or even more despicable, "feathering") has some legitimate 
uses, and it is a relief to have the option when it is really needed, 
but it has to be used rarely, and usually with apologies and promises 
not to do it again.

Agreed (and with the earlier points as well, omitted for brevity);
but that is really a fault of \bigskipamount rather than \bigskip
per se.  Both are problematic, but for different reasons.

Oval corners can be done with pstricks. 

For example

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pstricks}
\begin{document}
\psframebox[framearc=0.5]{\parbox{1in}{Some text\\ in a box}}
\end{document}

it is mostly the font sizes that are a problem with certain M$ browsers. 
But that one can program around that by setting the body font size in a 
special way.

I'd recommend that you had a look at the articles on alistapart.org (or 
something like that), which is a very nice site for webdesign.

Hi,

 

Alec Julien suggested I contact you about a project that I am starting
which will require manipulating Biblical Hebrew text.

 

In Biblical texts, there are multiple markings (such as diacritical
marks, vowels and musical notation) which appear above & below letters
(sometimes 3 or 4 per letter!).  While there are scholarly fonts that
can handle this, I want to split several characters to eliminate
ambiguity, and Unicode doesn't allow such innovation.

 

For example, the Hebrew vowel called schva (the origin of schwa in
English) either connotes no sound or a short schwa sound after the
letter it appears under.  I would like to have two different glyphs to
connote the two sounds. I would like to split some other symbols into as
many as three, each of which would have a bold & regular glyph.

 

Mr Julien thought maybe TeX/LaTeX could help me around a specific
problem -that  manipulating a vowel in Unicode fonts required
manipulating the whole letter & its markings at the same time, defeating
my purpose. Even changing color was impossible, as the letter and its
attendant symbols are considered a unit. Does TeX/LaTeX have the same
limitation?

 

Do you think my project can be undertaken using TeX/LaTeX? If so, I'll
spend the hours trying to figure out the system while I'm not treating
patients.

 

Thank you for your help.

pdftex has useful extensions to the plain tex format but almost all 
of plain tex still works. For my work I use pdftex plus eplain.tex. I 
just don't like LaTeX.

Books I have on plain tex that are less heavy than The TeXBook 
include "TeX for the Impatient" (Abrahams et al.) and "A Beginners
book of TeX"  (Seroul & Levy).  Try Amazon Marketplace for either.
I think "...Impatient" is still available in pdf form also.

And of course do not neglect the oldie but goodie "A Gentle 
Introduction to TeX". With permission I have posted a pdf of this 
classic on my website:

There were a couple of papers in TUGboat about scholarly Hebrew
typesetting:

http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb24-1/hoenig.pdf (see great
examples there!)

http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb15-3/tb44haralambous-hebrew.pdf

Studies, 44, 171-184 (2003).
