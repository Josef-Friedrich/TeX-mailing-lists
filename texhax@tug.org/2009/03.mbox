Hi
I've come across both \ldots and \cdots in typesetting series in \sum 
-- \{1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + n\}. What would the list recommend?
Thanks
Paul

I've heard about a package called fouridx that might help you solve this 
problem, but I haven't tried it.

In mathematics, in the example you give, \cdots is preferred as the dots should be aligned with the operation signs (+ in this case).

\ldots is usually reserved for lists, as in the components of an n-tuple (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n).

Perhaps the mopst important use of \ldots, for non-mathematical 
compositors like me, is to produce a three-dot ellipsis that harmonizes 
with the typeface you happen to be using.  I have written a \fourdots 
macro to provide the same predictable ellipsis spacing at the end of a 
sentence.  If anyone is interested I will send it on.

I think that is a matter of taste. I (mathematician) use \cdots only in 
matrices.

when you have binary operators centered on the mathematical axis, use  
\cdots
when you have sequences of numbers of variables separated by commas,  
use \ldots

$1+2+\cdots+n$ but $1,2,\ldots,n$

some other dots are specialized to multiple integrals, etc.

BTW, I had overlooked this so far. This is a special point that fouridx 
addresses.

Very good! However, according to www.ctan.org/pkg/fouridx this just is made 
to improve \sideset from amsmath, in the present case 
$\sideset{^x}{}{\operatorname{N}}$ suffices. For comparison: 
$\sideset{^x}{^x}{\operatorname{N}}$). $^x\mathrm{N}^x$ also has the 
symmetry, but the superscripts are lower than with `N' as an operator. I 
was about to suggest $^x\!\operatorname{N}^x$ which repairs horizontal 
spacing, but the left superscript is lower than the right one ...

Cheers,

     Uwe.

in most cases I use \dots, not \ldots nor \cdots, \dots has the advance 
that it looks at the item following it, so \dots, => \ldots, and \dots+ 
=> \cdots+, then the only thing you need to worry about the are 
situations where the dots come last.

BTW: someone talked about a fourdots macro, doesn't four dots at the end 
of a sentence look odd? I usually see three dots at the end of a 
sentence in the same way as a dot, i.e. end of sentence, no need to an 
extra dot.

In a direct quote, if one leaves out the last part of a complete sentence, the beginning fragment should end with four dots: the first three are the ellipsis, indicating the omission, and the last is the period, indicating how much was omitted.

Such are much more common in literary and philosophical works than in math or science.

Hi folks
1. What effect does placing a letter [A-Za-z] in math mode produce, 
for example $x$ $A$?

2. The \mathcal macro displays the enclosed character in caligraph 
fond. According to the document at
http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hildebr/tex/course/intro2.html

It says that it's used "often to denote sets". What sort of sets? 
Some more information on the effects of the mathcal macro on the 
enclosed character plus it's uses would be appreciated.

3. The same document states that the \mathbb macro can be used for 
displaying rationals reals and so forth. Again, What visual effects 
does the mathbb have on the enclosing character. I have come across 
quite a few of those \math macros -- mathrm, mathtt and so on. It's 
hard to know what they do or, more importantly, when they should be 
used. Any tips would be most appreciated.

Thanks
Paul

It sets the letter in maths italic, which is similar
to (but not the same as) text italics.

I'm no mathematician (as Chris Rowley will hasten to assure
you !) but a short fragment from an LMS paper may help :

It creates "blackboard bold", which looks as if the same
character had been rendered twice with a small displacement
(horizontal) between the two instances.

In general, the "math" prefix simply indicates that the
macro is intended for use in maths mode; the characters
that follow indicate the intended effect, such as
"rm" => "roman", meaning upright; "tt" -> "teletype",
meaning monospaced and highly stylised.  It's a great
shame that (as far as I know) no-one has yet reported
a document from whence all of these things can be
gleaned.

mathcal is often used to define sets consisting of sets. A typical 
example is the set of equivalence classes of a equivalence relation.

The difference among \text* and \math* is a question of *meaning*, not
layout. Let me copy a piece o text from The LaTeX Companion (sec 7.4 on p.
347):

"...(in math formulas) individual shapes convey specific information. For
example, bold upright letters may represent vectors..."

So, you don't use \math* just because you are in math mode, but because you
need to set a specific meaning to a symbol, and this is (or might be) done
changing the font (the more appropriate one is up to you).

The question is more or less the same as asking "what is the difference
between \textit and \emph?" And the answer is that while \textit switch the
font to an italic shape, \emph *emphasizes* the text, what can be done with
bold faces, underlines, colors, italics (\textit, for instance) etc.

In time: the fonts associated to the comands \text* and \math* are
different, although in the Computer Modern families they are equal in series
and shapes. You can check this by loading a font package that does not have
support for math fonts (utopia, for example).

... or of *proper classes*, consisting of sets, not being sets themselves 
("too large", "contradictory").

A similar use is for *categories* in Category Theory, which often are 
"proper class versions" of relational structures whose underlying "sets" 
are proper classes indeed.

In Model Theory (belonging to Mathematical Logic) caligraphic letters quite 
consistently refer to "relational structures"; $\mathcal{A}$ may denote a 
relational structure consisting of an underlying set $A$ and subsets of 
multiple cartesian products of $A$ with itself.

I just see Paul's question on the power set: right, this may be the most 
common use!
(besides Fraktur, somewhat like with imaginary vs. real numbers.)

The effect is "calligraphic" [two `l'] letters, you also say "script style" 
[vs. \scriptstyle!??], looking like uppercase letters painted with a brush 
[right?]

Hope This Is True -- Uwe.

Often it rather looks ... e.g. when the Blackboard Bold typeface was not 
available, one could try some "poor man's blackboard bold" by setting an 
uppercase `I' very tightly to the left of `R', `N' etc.
(real, natural ... numbers)

The proper typeface for the reals and the natural numbers is upright bold; 
this was imitated at blackboards by drawing some strokes twice ... and 
maybe especially in Germany this seems to be considered the standard 
canonical way of real numbers etc., it is very common in German textbooks. 
I.e. the blackboard version is considered correct and the original English 
typeface is considered misleading ... [right?]

I think that's what lies at the heart of my question. I am first and 
foremost interested in the semantics as denoted by the various font 
attributes. Of course, it would help also to have some perspective of 
the physical attributes  as well.

A mathematician writes ---

>> Let me copy a piece of text from The LaTeX Companion (sec 7.4 on p.
347):

ibid, Chap 8 contains a lot more information about math mode and the AMS
mathematical packages.

However, whilst the following is correct:

  "...(in math formulas) individual shapes convey specific information"

there is not very much consistency about what that information is amongst
mathematcians.  (Physicists tend to be more consistent and concerned about
the exact meanings of various typographical usages.)

Thus it says 'may' here:

  "For example, bold upright letters may represent vectors..."

This is also a nice example as, whereas in physics, vectors are vectors are
vectors (maybe I exaggerate:-), in maths there are lots of uses of the term
'vectors' and these may, or may not, have different notational conventions.

So, you don't use \math* just because you are in math mode, but because you
need to set a specific meaning to a symbol, and this is (or might be) done
changing the font (the more appropriate one is up to you).

The question is more or less the same as asking "what is the difference
between \textit and \emph?" And the answer is that while \textit switch the
font to an italic shape, \emph
emphasizes
 the text, what can be done with bold faces, underlines, colors, italics
 (\textit, for instance) etc.

In time: the fonts associated to the comands \text* and \math* are
different, although in the Computer Modern families they are equal in
series and shapes. You can check this by loading a font package that does
not have support for math fonts (utopia, for example).

Yes, certainly for variables : the problem is that
one needs to be a mathematician (or at least to have
more than a passing familiarity with maths notation)
to know when italics are called for and when not.
It is easier to differentiate between maths italic
and text italic : the latter is simply for use in
non-mathematical text whenever italics are called for.

And in case you are uncertain exactly how italics
differ from more conventional, so-called "Roman",
letters, italics are slanted to the right by a few
degrees, but are re-drawn so that they are more ornate
that a simple slanting of the Roman text would give.

Mathematicians are using much more mathematical objects than
physicists and are always short in notations.

yes, that is well known problem. Debian's package of texinfo installs
the GNU install-info as ginstall-info.

There are some things on the horizont, but for away for now:
- we on Debian are trying to replace dpkg install-info with GNU
  install-info in the long run
- texinfo/install-info will NOT be part of TeX Live 2009 anyway.

On So, 01 M?r 2009, R (Chandra) Chandrasekhar wrote:

Can you give me examples of packages NOT working correctly? because the
texinfo GNU install-info should be new enough in TL2008 to deal with
many packages.

Examples please ... best would be only the postinst code that calls the
install-info ... Thanks

Finally, if some ubuntu/debian guy wants to help me with the
Debian/install-info -> GNU/install-info transition please contact me,
there is URGENT need for that!

Best wishes

Norbert

I started out with a clean /usr/local/bin directory as this was a fresh 
installation on a new system. The same applied to 
/usr/local/man/man{1|5}and to /usr/local/info. Therefore, I emptied all 
four directories using the dreaded

sudo rm -f *

and set up the environment variables in ~/.bashrc.

If you have stuff in the /usr/local/{bin,man,info} trees, you might need 
to use file timestamps to filter out and remove only those symlinks put 
in by the TeXLive installation.

I would suggest using

find

to filter the wanted files using timestamp, name, or some other 
criterion, and then deleting those files. For example,

find . -mtime +1 -exec rm {} \;

will delete all files that have a timestamp older than 24 h from now.

You could use

find . -mtime +1

to check that the filtered files are indeed those you wish to delete and 
then use rm -f to do it non-interactively.

Above all, please double check before invoking rm :-)

HTH.

Hi,


My name is Arif, and like most of the LaTeX user, I've learned LaTeX myself.

We all know the flexibility with which we can typeset our document in LaTeX
and I'm really impressed with it as most of it's users are.

*I 'm looking for getting some work to typeset in LaTeX, this would allow me

So can some provide me an idea to get freelancing job in LaTeX or can
provide me such job(s).

I understand that I've an intermediate knowledge of LaTeX and will be able
to typeset most of the documents.

 *I'm from India, so low cost would also be an advantage for the firm that
would outsource the job, rest assured quality won't be comprised.*

It sets a 3 above a 4 and encloses them both in a single pair of sufficiently 
tall parentheses. The 3 and the 4 are the same size as each other. You 
probably already know what it denotes, but just in case you don't, here's one 
way to describe it: $\binom{n}{r}$ denotes the coefficient of $x^r y^{n-r}$ in 
the expansion of $(x + y)^n$.

On my system ~/.profile executes ~/.bashrc.  This seems to be more
sensible than to duplicate things.  To achieve this, add a line

  source ~/.bashrc

or

  . ~/.bashrc

to your ~/.profile if it doesn't exist already.

Both variants are equivalent.  But you need "source" (or ".") because
otherwise all settings done in ~/.bashrc exist only while .bashrc is
running.

  Reinhard

There's also the "tensor" package. Though it could be that it's equivalent
to fouridx or \sideset. Maybe worth a look.

Oh my.  These days I tend to do this:

sudo mv * /tmp

Then if I've messed up, I can recover.

If it's ok, the files get deleted at the next reboot.

There's a wee problem in that \binom{3}{4} would denote the  
coefficient of
x^4 y^{-1} in the expansion of (x + y)^3 --- and there isn't one.

As far as I can discern there is no way to make \binom{3}{4}  
meaningful, since
Gamma(0) is undefined.

Now \binom{4}{3} --- that's a different story! :-)

>> There's a wee problem in that \binom{3}{4} would denote

That rather assumes the 'standard formatting' of this bit of TeX.

There is no definition of what mathematical expression any bit of TeX
'denotes'.

There are some common conventions and these are built into many non-TeX
applications (see last week's quiz for an example).

By contrast, TeX itself allows a package-writer to make any character or
macro produce any formatting she likes.

It seems highly likely to me that there are LaTeX packages that make the
formatted output of \binom very different from the US (AMS) standard that
was described on this list.  These would be needed for high school maths in
many European countries (different for different traditions/countries).

Note also the moral that just because a bit of maths notation looks
convincing, it can easily be mathematical garbage.

Summary:

1.  reading the TeX (or equally the formatted output) can at best only give
a hint to the knowledgable concerning its 'mathematical meaning'.

2.  the power of the LaTeX approach is that reading the TeX often tells you
little about the deatiled visual appearance of the formatted output.

Actually, there's not a problem here, since  1/Gamma(0) = 0 and 
1/Gamma(n) = 0 for any negative
integer n.   As a consequence, \binom{3}{4} = 3!/(4!(-1)!) = 
Gamma(4)/[Gamma(5)Gamma(0)] = 0, which is the correct answer for the 
coefficient of x^4y^{-1} in (x+y)^3.
Alternatively, the binomial coefficient represented by \binom{n}{m} is 
defined as zero whenever
the integer m is greater than the integer n.
Admittedly, the example \binom{4}{3} would have been less likely to lead 
to confusion.

What puzzled me when I started using TeX in the early eighties, were  
the commands \cup and \cap (symbols I called "union" and  
"intersection"); everytime I used them I had to spend a few seconds  
visualizing in my mind a cup (= coupe) and a cap (= chapeau) to figure  
out which one I should choose. I could never use them naturally... Are  
they called like that in oral mathematics in the Anglosaxon world?

On the other hand, I had no difficulties in learning \hat because in  
French we also say "chapeau" for the circumflex (in mathematics).

this is one of the reasons why I recommend our users to add their own 
macro names for various symbols, e.g. \isomorph for \cong, if \cong is 
used to denote isomorphisms in their field. That way the code becomes a 
lot more readable.

Part of my job is to process papers for a well-known Mathematical  
Society, and I'm talking of several thousand pages per year.

In this context, personalized macros are a FELONY, a HEADACHE, a  
CURSE...

1) First of all, often they are bad, one has to read and correct them  
(for example, people will use \rm instead of \mathrm, \matrix instead  
of the matrix environment, eqnarray instead of align, etc. not to  
mention people who want to manually insert spaces about everywhere)

2) secondly, their names will often conflict with other commands I  
need (and we don't have namespaces yet in LaTeX), and the effects will  
sometimes be very subtle (this is also a bit mea culpa since I will  
rather use \def than \newcommand)

3) thirdly, they will always appear in places they shouldn't:  
abstracts, bibliographical references, section names, and the like.  
These pieces of information are needed when compiling data outside the  
scope of individual articles, and macro definitions do not accompany  
them...

So please do not encourage people to use their own macros. I would  
rather appreciate institutions (LUGs, Mathematical societies,  
Faculties) to prepare standard styles with alternative names for  
macros, it will always be better than empirical impulsive "100%  
personal" macros...

ndeed, I think this depends on which side of the pond you happen to be
writing: all American sources appear to suggest a four-dot version.
However, at schoold in England I was taught never to use four dots; this
page
http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-4100100en.htm
and, I believe, the Oxford Guide to Style suggest the same.

The packages were related to my installation of the prevu package.

Specifically, the gettext and wdiff packages were involved and the error 
message when I attempted removal of the not-fully installed packages was:
----

After this operation, 0B of additional disk space will be used.

Errors were encountered while processing:

There were several other packages in the list when the first error 
message was displayed during installation, but since they could all be 
removed except for these two, and I did not note their names down.

In the context of some discussions about how LaTeX3 might provide some
kind of namespace protection, I wonder what you think would be useful.
It's easy to make suggestions, but I'd be interested to know how people
who have to deal with documents arriving from varied sources see this.

As an author, I want to use logical high-level markup. This is one of the
biggest advantages of TeX. I believe that we should encourage people to 
use logical macros. Ask them to write

\EXP{\frac {1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i | Y}

rather than

\mathop{\mathbf{E}} \left{ \frac {1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \,\middle|\, Y \right}

Use logical macros rather than explicit font switches (mathcal, mathsrc, 
mathds, or mathfrak), etc.

I understand your concerns, but I do not think that discouraging people to 
write their own macros helps. Take the case of someone using \rm instead 
of \mathrm in their macros. To give a concerete example, suppose someone 
uses

\newcommand{diff}{{\rm diff}}

and then types f_{\diff} in the the text. Suppose the journal style asks 
not to use personal macros. In that case, the author will use f_{\rm diff} in 
the text. That does not really solve your problem, does it? What is needed 
are good tutorials explaining people how to write good macros 
(programming in tex is hard, but most macros do not really do anything 
fancy). Clashes in macro names can also be easily avoided. Ask authors 
to use uppercase names for their macros and do not define any macro which 
is less than 3 letters. This elimates most potential clashes with existing classes 
and styles. Use editor macros to save typing; TeX macros should be
verbose. As an institutional publisher, you can 
also use a personal namespace while defining your macros. For example, 
IEEEtran uses macros like \IEEEsomething for many (all?) of its macros. 
This helps in avoilding clashes with users' macros. Regarding not using 
macros in abstracts etc., the submission guidelines should state 
clearly what is allowed and what is not. Depending on how you want to 
post-process the abstract and section head information, either say that no 
LaTeX markup is allowed, or give a list of marcos that are allowed (or the 
list of classes and styles whole macros can be used).

The above solutions are not perfect, but trying to avoid problems by 
asking people not to use logical markup is wrong. I agree that there 
should be packages that encourage logical markup (e.g, the mlist package 
by Will Robertson) and guidelines for user macros. But remeber, that such 
packages are written by users. If you discourage them to write macros, 
they will never clean up their macros and write a package.

Well, beamer uses <foo> notation for layers, one could some different  
notation for namespace prefixes, for example : as in XML.

If we use the XML paradigm, LaTeX packages would define name space  
strings and prefixes, and macros belonging to a given package would  
use that prefix. Author Dupont would use xmlns:dup="http://www.unauteurstupide.com/nicolas/dupont 
" (I use XML notation here) and if he defines a macro \diff, one could  
write \diff (ambiguous) or \dup:diff (macro \diff belonging to the  
namespace whose prefix is dup)

As editor of papers I would then provide a name space to the author's  
personal macros (if they don't have one already) and this would

Right and wrong depend on your viewpoint. From the viewpoint of having  
elegantly and clearly written documents, you are right. From the  
viewpoint of having less work to do when processing TeX code for  
making it to fit into a given journal, you are wrong. So all depends  
on what you are going to do with that code. Imagine we apply a method  
to convert all of our LaTeX code into something even more logical, for  
example XML+MathML with logically marked up formulas and RDF triples  
using standard ontologies. What would be easier to process? Logical  
LaTeX markup, but different for every user, or more presentation- 
oriented LaTeX code, but using only standard LaTeX macros?

I think that it would be the second. But maybe I'm wrong.

I'm not talking about very specific stuff which would eventually  
result in a package. For example, when I have an author who has  
written code for some new system of notation of mathematics (Feynman  
diagrams or Petri networks or the like), I'm certainly glad if he has  
written as many and as complete macros as possible.

I'm talking about ordinary stuff: symbols, operators, expressions  
which occur often in a document, etc. You can't imagine how many ways  
mathematicians have found to write \mathbb{R} or \mathfrak{G}... Some  
of them will even start by manually loading the fonts, some still use I 
\!\!R for \mathbb{R} ...  Even if these people end up writing a  
package, it will probably be a bad package...  ;-)

My suggestion is: if \cup and \cap are unclear in a French context,  
let GUTenberg define \union and \intersection, and make that part of  
frenchb.sty, and ask people to use it. But don't necessarily encourage  
them to write their own macros

So that explains it.  This is one instance where Unicode fonts do not 
usually help much, because
the normal ellipsis character in the General Punctuation page looks very 
bad with regular type.  It is much too tight.
It looks even worse, of course when a three-dot ellipsis is either 
preceded or followed by a full stop. 
The house style I set for is fairly firm about the four-dot ellipsis for 
sentence end, and the ellipsis
abuts the text immediately, with no interword space.

I set a four-language journal (potentially five, since Latin is 
recognized, although never used) and these national
considerations can be quite fascinating.  Em-dash with or without 
interword spaces, for instance and, even
more odd to a north American eye,  em-dash followed by interword space 
and punctuation.

Similarly to "amidst/amid" and "amongst/among", there is no difference as
such.

>From Wikipedia:

Whilst is synonymous with while in standard British English and Australian
English; in American English and Canadian English, it can be considered
pretentious or archaic.

Whilst is chiefly used in British English and Australian English. Whilst is
synonymous with while in standard English, although to many it sounds
slightly old-fashioned, and is rare or archaic.  In their style guides, some
modern publications on both sides of the Atlantic disapprove of its use
(along with "amidst" and "amongst"), for example:

    * Times Online Style Guide: "while (not whilst)"
    * Guardian Style Guide: "while not whilst"
    * Hansard: the Canadian Parliament record: "while not whilst"

Message-ID: <61EAA861-282D-4BC3-A637-B7931E20A55A@auckland.ac.nz>


This is really more a problem with Mac OS X than with latex, ...
But I don't know where else to turn and this list is usually very
helpful.  Said he hopefully.

Recently I unwisely did a re-install of LaTex on my Imac --- using,
I *think* ``sudo fink install latex''.  Can't even remember why I
did this. :-(

Ever since, things that used to work now don't.

This morning I tried to process a powerdot presentation to which
I had made some slight adjustments, and got errors in respect of
xkeyval --- it complained that I had requested a newer version
of xkeyval than was available, and then threw an error about
an undefined control sequence.  I can give further details if
these are relevant, but I don't think so.

Upon investigation I found that the xkeyval package in

	/sw/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex

was indeed out of date, and the latex that gets used is in
/sw/bin.  But there is a perfectly up-to-date xkeyval in

	/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/latex

which seems to be what is pointed to by the symbolic links inside

	/Library/TeX/Distributions

I would have thought that this last would be what would get used
by latex by default under Mac OSX (I must confess that I really
don't understand the convolutions that Mac OSX superimposes upon
Unix) but it seems not.  As I said above, /sw/bin/latex seems to
get used and this seems to draw upon the out-of-date stuff in
/sw/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex.

There is a /usr/texbin that appears automagically in my path,
and this seems to point at the right thing.  I tried setting
my path explicitly in my .cshrc file, putting /usr/texbin ahead
of /sw/bin.  But blow me down, when I echo my path afterwards,
/sw/bin and /sw/sbin are always the first two entries in the
path, no matter what I tell it.  (I *hate* it when computers refuse
to do what you tell them!)  And the wrong latex still gets
used.

How can I get the /sw/bin/latex out of the way?  Does anyone out there
understand Mac OSX enough to help me?

Thanks.

	cheers,

Rolf,

I'm ccing your message below to Richard Koch, MacTeX maintainer.

(By the way, I would advise you to subscribe to the Mac OS X TeX  
mailing list:

http://email.esm.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/macosx-tex )

MacTeX installs a control panel in System Preferences, called TeX  
distribution, that lets you shift from one TeX distribution to another  
with just a mouse click; for example, you can have TeXLive-2007,  
TeXLive-2008, gwTeX, Fink's teTeX and MacPorts TeX, and choose which  
one you want to use at any time.

So check the control panel, and see which distribution is selected in  
it.

If that doesn't work. You can do three things: 1) reinstall MacTeX so  
it again takes control of your distributions; 2) tell Fink to  
uninstall teTeX (but that would be a problem if you have Fink's  
packages that depend on it); or 3) comment out momentarily the Fink  
line ( . /sw/bin/init.sh in .bashrc, and something similar in .cshrc),  
logout ---or restart your computer--- and see if your system now  
recognizes TeXLive as your valid distribution.

Best,

Axel

at least at the initial level.  See below.

I checked the control panel; there were three choices: Fink-teTeX,  
TeXLive-2007,
and TeXLive-2008.  The TexLive-2008 seemed to be the active one, i.e.  
its
button was ``high-lighted'' (had a black do in it).

Nya-ha!  That's where the refusal to set my path to what I want is
coming from.  I should've noticed that; it was right before my eyes.
Bit of a ``duhhhh'' on my part.

> logout ---or restart your computer--- and see if your system now

I commented out the ``source /sw/bin/init.sh" line in my .cshrc file
sourced .cshrc, and then did  ``latex junk''.  Bingo!  It ran; no
error thrown.  (And of course my path was as I had specified it.)

So I've got a workaround at least.  Seems a wee bit jerry-built to
jigger around with the path like that, but.  Am I running into any
dangers that way?

Thanks for your help.

The purpose of that line is to *prepend* Fink's path. They say they  
have good reasons for that.

I don't think so ---you seem to know what you're doing. And you can  
change it if something doesn't work. When I used Fink ---years ago---  
what I did was to erase it's path altogether and use the X11  
application menu to call it's programs with something like

source /sw/bin/init.sh ; texmacs &

Surely not, Sir : "pretentious /and/ archaic", maybe :-)

For myself, I use "while" to indicate a parallel or
collateral passage of time, whilst I use "whilst" to
indicate a contrast (as in this sentence).  I do not
know if this distinction is also made by others.

I believe this to be indeed common usage among those who wish to avail
themselves of the richness of the English language whilst the rest are
apparently quite happy to linguistically castrate themselves - a pity!

>> Surely not, Sir : "pretentious /and/ archaic", maybe :-)

While this is definitely more correct, such logical precision would have
necessitated my recalling the _Eurpoean_ notation for making a short change
in a quote (now which manual is that in?) whilst construcing my
pretentiously witty and archaic (but short) message.  Boom boom!!

Aha, here is another distractive activity or two (or three): 'if' or
'whether' in

i'm stuck on the problem of putting a counter *inside* a table 
(specifically longtable) to number each entry within the single table. 
seems reasonable for latex, right?

here's what i tried so far - so i think it is NOT as simple as :

\newcounter{myCounter} %<- in preamble
\setcounter{myCounter} %<- increment=1
.....
\value{myCounter} %<- in longtable environment

error is :
! Missing number, treated as zero.

is that right?  i may need these other packages i've been reading about?

You can use \dots, which converts to one of the above behind the scenes 
depending on context (the change of dots depends on the next symbol). For 
example,

We have the series $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n$, the regional sum 
$A_1+A_2+\dots+A_n$, the orthogonal product $A_1 A_2 \dots A_n$,
and the infinite integral
\[\int_{A_1}\int_{A_2}\dots\].

Much easier than having to worry about which dots to use (but it is wrong 
sometimes, like in $A_1 A_2 \dots A_n$ above)

That line is an error

Absolutely no other context!?

My random guess is you meant \themyCounter.

To increment a counter you should use \stepcounter{counter} instead of
\setcounter,
which, by the way, has the following sintax: \setcounter{counter}{value}.[]s

All these are used in mathematics and related disciplines.  In his
TeXbook Don Knuth devotes 4 chapters (16, 17, 18, and 19) to how to
typeset mathematics and the fine points of doing so.  The amsmath
package for LaTeX2e makes minor changes, e.g. instead of \pmatrix{
....} it uses \begin{pmatrix}....\end{pmatrix} and provides more
facilities, but the four chapters are basic and it is easy to see what
happens when using amsmath.

I  am registrar at a small PhD granting institution.

We send  our student's transcripts  on request.

Is there a set of TeX or LaTex macros to manage and produce transcripts?

How would one do some math like grade point averages etc in such a  system?

I could  not find answers to this by google or CPAN.

Hi folks

what do the letters l and r mean in \lfloor \lceil and \rfloor and \rceil?
would this
	$t ( \lfloor n/2 rfloor )$
	or this
		$t (\left \lfloor n/2 rfloor \right)$
		be more appropriate?
Please feel free to make Any other changes to the code frag.
many thanks

\lfloor is the left side of the the floor bracket, and \rfloor the right.
\lfloor looks kind of like a capital L, while \rfloor is the mirror image.
If the innards of the bracket is tall (like a \frac, for example) using
$\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor$ would be best. \ceil is similar.

\lceil is a vertical line with a right-facing horizontal line at the top
(like the right half of a T, or an F without the middle branch), and \rceil
is the mirror image, like the left half of a T, or a 7

To continue with Robert's L-based description: \lceil and \rceil look
just like \lfoor and \rfloor, but they're flipped vertically (that is,
reflected about their central horizontal axis).  So the \lceil looks
like an inverted capital L and the \rceil looks like turned capital L
(i.e., an L that has been rotated 180 degrees).

The floor and ceiling brackets don't have serifs -- just two
perpendicular lines.  To me, they look more like square brackets [ and
] with either the top or bottom horizontal strokes removed.  (The
bottom strokes are removed for ceiling, and the top strokes are
removed for floor.)

Hi



Could you pls tell me how to left align the output from this code:



\begin{equation*}

a_{ig} =

\begin{cases}

1 & \text{if customer $i$ belongs to profile group $g$}\\

0 & \text{otherwise}\\[.3cm]

\end{cases}

\end{equation*}



Thanks, regards

First, in your preamble,

\usepackage{amsmath}

then,

\begin{flalign*}
a_{ig} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if customer $i$ belongs to profile group $g$}\\
0 & \text{otherwise} \\[.3cm]
\end{cases} && %% <------------------ these two &&
\end{flalign*}

If you use TeXLive 2008 or a recent MiKTeX, I think you should have  
Mathmode.pdf; in your terminal or command prompt,

texdoc mathmode

Best,

Axel

Subject: [texhax] Transparency or reduced saturation using Graphicx ?
Message-ID: <49B047E4.6010900@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Dear Colleagues -- I am including a large number (> 4000)
of graphic images in PDF format in a LaTeX document through
the medium of the Graphicx interface.   To achieve a nice
visual balance between the images (which were scanned at
different times, and processed using different technologies),
I can adjust the relative size of each.  But for some extremely
heavy images (see attached, which are the same abbreviation
in two very different scribal hands, and processed using
very different technologies), reducing the size is  insufficient :
what I really need is to be able to make the heavier graphic less
intrusive, either by rendering it partially transparent or
by mapping the fully saturated black to a less saturated grey.

I can find nothing in the Graphicx  documentation that suggests
that either of these is possible, but in the faint hope that
I have overlooked something, I am asking here.

The closest I ever got to a transparent image was actually a watermark.
Check out the eso-pic package (

Whatever you do is not going to be easy.  What I would do (and I 
recently had to do it with 149 images) is take a screenshot, using 
import if you have it available, convert the image to TIFF, and operate 
on it either with GIMP or with Adobe Streamline, to get the spines of 
all the heavy lines.  With the right Streamline settings you should be 
able to come to a fairly close approximation of the lighter penstrokes 
on the associated image. 

One other approach, which may be precluded because you seem to be 
dealing with a simple Black-White image rather than any level of 
grayscale, would be to convert it to indexed gray-scale (about 15 levels 
should do) in GIMP and then nip away at the outer edges by progressively 
resetting the lighter grays to white.  Then harden up the remaining 
dark-gray to black pixels to simple black. I have found that an 
extremely useful way to fine down slovenly (200DPI) scans of what was 
originally line art, so that the result was an acceptable imitation of a 
1200DPI scan.  But usually you need to start with some reasonable level 
of gray scale, which doesn't seem to be available in your samples.

If only a simple graying out is needed, GIMP layers will do it.  The top 
layer can be set as not fully transparent.

I really don't see why. Can you try with the short document below? It  
typesets fine for me.

Axel's mailer seems to wrap lines that it shouldn't (mine does too, which
explains the indentation used below) and so, if his script is used as is,
the "\end{flalign*}" in the last line will be ignored (owing to the %%).

Try the version below (which does work), but make sure that it really
appears as here (note also that there must be no blank lines within the
"flalign*" environment):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

\begin{flalign*}
  a_{ig} =
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if customer $i$ belongs to profile group $g$}\\
    0 & \text{otherwise} \\[.3cm]
  \end{cases} && %% <------------------ these two && 
\end{flalign*} 

\end{document}

The output seems a little odd; maybe you don't really want the "\\[.3cm]" in
the second line inside the "cases" environment.

Cheers,  Phil

Another option is to use ImageMagick from the command line so that it  
can be scripted or put in a make file for processing multiple images.  
For example, the command:

convert +level-colors gray23,white abr-ekklhsias.pdf lighterVersion.pdf

replaces the color black with gray23 (r=59,g=59,b=59) and makes a  
linear transformation to white.
And you can antialias, apply filters, etc.

Convert accepts pretty much any image format you can dream up both as  
inputs and outputs.

More info on the color mapping at:
   http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color/#gamma
   (Check for "Level Adjustment by Color" about 1/3 down the page)

Best,
   Andree

My thanks to all who made suggestions for tackling this problem.
My first thought was to try Ivan Ramos Pagnossin's idea :

but I failed to get it to work in the context in which I need it.
I reproduce a fragment of the original (below), where it will
be seen that I need the resulting image in an \hbox for further
manipulation and placement :

     \ifdim #2 pt > 0 pt \scaledheight = #2\targetheight \scaledwidth = #2\targetwidth \fi
     \setbox 0 = \hbox {\includegraphics [height = \scaledheight, width=\scaledwidth, clip=true, keepaspectratio=true]{\Prefix/#3-#4.pdf}}%
     \setbox 0 = \hbox  {\href {\Prefix/#3-#4.pdf}{\box 0 }}%
     \ifdim \wd 0 < \targetwidth \wd 0 = \targetwidth \fi
     \drop = \ht 0
     \advance \drop by -2 ex
     \leavevmode
     \vrule height \baselineskip depth \dp \strutbox width 0 pt
     \smash {\lower \drop \hbox spread 1 pc {\box 0 \hss}}%

I tried to work out from the TeXdoc documentation on TikZ/PGF
what sort of an object

 >   \begin{*tikzpicture*}
 >     \node [opacity=0.15] {\includegraphics[...]{...}};
 >   \end{*tikzpicture*}

should yield, but regret to say that I failed :-(  I will now
try  some of the other suggestions (I was hoping to find one
that would allow me to manipulate the image during TeX processing,
which is why I started with the TikZ approach, but if that is
not possible then off-line pre-processing is a viable option).

Perhaps the transparent package from the oberdiek bundle works:

\usepackage{transparent}
...
\texttransparent{0.2}{\includegraphics[...]{...}}

All,

When using the \cite command for consecutive numeric references, how does
one obtain output as "[1-3]" instead of "[1,2,3]"?

E.g., I have \cite{Baron:1986, Bauer:2006, Smith:2009} and this produces
[1,2,3].

This is very nice; my sincere thanks, both to Stephan (for
the lead) and to Heiko (for the hard work behind it).
A quick test suggests I need

	\transparent

rather than

	\texttransparent

and that I need to set and restore the transparency state
just before and just after typesetting the box containing
the graphic, but that apart, it worked like a dream once
I realised that it was a two-pass approach, and that a
change would not be visible until two successive runs
with the same parameters.

I have been trying to get \marginpars to print all on the left (in a 
two-sided style).  It appears to me that
\newcommand\xlabel[1]{\marginpar[#1]{}\label{#1}}
should do it, but it actually prints nothing on odd numbered pages.  Is 
there an easy way of doing this?

How can blind people access the TeXbook? All I can contribute to my 
question is that the copyright holder is the American Mathematical Society, 
so the question should be directed to *them* (I am not a member).

Indeed I am playing with this for some applications, in the "job" sense. 
\tt may be too painful to read, perhaps some earlier letters of mine using 
\tt were not understood. cmvtt may look likewise "humble" while more 
convienently to read. \tt may be somewhat contradictory in an application 
where I call myself an expert for typography.

Reinhard's suggestion has also encouraged me to use the primitive font 
switch in place of \DeclareBlahBlah ...

I need to know, however, whether cmvtt looks sufficiently serious, not 
funny, not like an invitation to a party or to a funeral.

Thanks,

     Uwe.

The mandatory argument of \marginpar is typeset on right pages, unless 
\reversemarginpar.

Kernel LaTeX seems not to support this, but marginal.sty from sttools seems 
to do it with \onesidemarginals (not tested).

You may need the feature at first lines of paragraphs only, you could then 
start such a paragraph with \xlabel and something like

     \newcommand\xlabel[1]{%
         \llap{#1\hspace\marginparsep}%
         \label{#1}\ignorespaces}

Hi,

I'm trying to integrate latex into my build system. I use autotools,
along with make. I can't figure out how to have latex automatically
generate the dependencies. The closest I have found is this,
  http://www.ams.org/tex/snapshot.html
the only problem with it is, it gives relative filenames, not absolute.

Shouldn't latex provide this feature? Any user using a build system to
build latex would require this functionality. I've found a dozen people
asking the same question over the years. Any thoughts on how I can solve
this problem?

Thanks,
Bob Rossi

In other words, roll my own \marginpar.  Obviously I need this only for 
draft mode, so fine typesetting not required.

Bob,

I'm not sure exactly what you want, but have you tried running latex
with a -recorder option, i.e.,

latex -recorder file.tex

? This generates a .fls file that has all the input files, etc., and
with full paths to the files. I attach a script I wrote around it to
pack up a latex file together with the various input files, graphics
files, etc., so I could ship it to someone else. Indeed, my script looks
for and throws away the files related to latex packages, which I guess
is what you want to keep!

Thanks, I had made that modification but I realise now that it is failing for me as I am running the code after this command:
\begin{longtable}{|p{14cm}|}
Is there a way to get it to work inside a table?

Thanks again,

I don't know longtable, but the following works, with a ridiculous  
minipage of just 1pc:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{longtable}
\begin{document}
\begin{longtable}{|p{14cm}|}
\hline
Hi\\ \hline
\begin{minipage}{1pc} % <- ridiculous, but works.
\[
a_{ig} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if customer $i$ belongs to profile group $g$}\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]\end{minipage}\par\\ % <- see the \par command
\hline
\end{longtable}
\end{document}


Best,

Axel

What is really ridiculous is that I didn't realize you don't need all  
that, but just the plain old $...$; that is,

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{longtable}
\begin{document}
\begin{longtable}{|p{14cm}|}

$ a_{ig} =

Subject: [texhax] Twocolumn, fancyhdr, fix2col, marks and dictionaries
Message-ID: <49B3F612.5020707@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Using the standard LaTeX document option "twocolumn"
with Piet van Oostrum's "fancyhdr" and David Carlisle's
"fix2col" styles, I have successfully generated
left and right page headings corresponding to the
headwords at the top of the left and the bottom of
the right column of each page (Attachment 1).

What I would like to be able to do, however, is to
emulate Cappelli's [1] style of headings, where his
left and right headers are themselves headword ranges :
the left header consists of the first and last headwords
in the left-hand column, separated by an en-dash, whilst
the right header consists of the first and last headwords
in the right-hand column, similarly punctuated.

My current code reads (in part)

     \markboth {\unexpanded {\textgreek {#5}}}{\textgreek {\unexpanded {#5}}}

     ...

     \renewcommand {\chaptermark}[1]{}
     \renewcommand {\sectionmark}[1]{}

     \pagestyle {fancy}
     \lhead {\rightmark}
     \chead {---\tie \thepage \tie ---}
     \rhead {\leftmark}
     \lfoot {}
     \cfoot {}
     \rfoot {}

where #5 contains the headword in extended Teubner notation.

I would be very grateful for any advice on how I should modify
this to emulate Cappelli's style of headings.

Interestingly, Heiko's "transparent" package
is behaving differently depending as the image
is raster or outline : attached are two PDF
images, representing the same scribal notation,
one in raster format and one in vector.

Also attach is a screenshop of the result of
embedding these two images using :

	\hbox spread 1 pc {\transparent {0.4}\box 0 \transparent {1.0}\hss}

from which it will be seen that the counter of
0202 abr-ashmos-qrusos.pdf (raster) remains pure
white, whilst the counter of 0203 abr-ashmos-qrusos1.pdf
(vector) becomes grey during the transparency
process.

Heiko, are you able to cast any light on this
behaviour, and to say whether it might be possible
to make the two images more consistent after applying
transparency ?

In case Philip has full control over the path shapes, the usual approach
to avoid "unfill" operations for drawing cut-outs is outlined in, e.g.,
<URL:http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb28-1/tb88henderson.pdf>,
section 4.2.

Thank you, Stephan.  I am afraid that we do not have
that level of control; these analytical outlines were
generated a long time ago, using Corel Trace V3, and
it will probably be simpler to go back to the original
scans and to avoid the vectorisation that we /thought/
would result in better reproduction at the time ...

The vector image first fills the counter^1 with black color
and then it fills the counter with white:

  1 0 obj <<
  ...
  >>
  stream
  0 0 0 1 k % this is black
  ...
  f* % fill black area, it includes the counter
  0 0 0 0 k % white
  ...
  f* % fill white area
  endstream
  endobj

Replace the second fill operator "f" with "%", then
you see the image entirely black.

The transparency applies to both, the black and the white
color, the result is grey.

Yours sincerely

What is really ridiculous is that I didn't realize you don't need all

Unfortunately, the effect is to turn off \marginpar entirely.  If I

Donald Arseneau and I had tried to make clear that using \marginpar with an 
empty mandatory argument is wrong, it is the reason when you wonder that 
somewhere nothing is printed. The mandatory argument is (by default ...) 
printed on right pages, so when it is empty, nothing is printed on right 
pages.

is *not* what Donald Arseneau suggested, he suggested using \marginpar 
without optional argument after

in the preamble. He may have overlooked your \label. So the suggestion 
rather is

It might be safer to precede \marginpar with \leavevmode.

Message-ID: <DE3834886335A6468AE675BD1189B3A22FF8655E@SEGOTC5138-CCR.vcn.ds.volvo.net>

Dear support,

I am writing to you as I don't know where to turn for help, I hope you can help or re-direct. My company does not approve of anything other than MS Word so please don't refer me to local help.

I use pdfLatex in MikTex 2.6. I have noticed that when I use the options 'viewport' and 'clip' in \includegraphics, I end up with very large pdf files since I often include only a small part of the picture. I then usually reduce the file by exporting from GSView at 300dpi. This usually works fine but is rotating a page in my current document so I want to eliminate the need.

I have noticed that if I look at the original pdf file and select an image which has been inserted in this way, it is cropped on screen but not cropped in the file. The whole picture is there and I can copy it into another application, and hence the large file size as the whole of all of my images has been included.

I have spent hours looking for a way of eliminating this problem but find only the standard info. Is there a way of doing a genuine, permenant crop to an image? Is there a default which can be set in the pdf compiler for example?

Yours hopefully
Tim

One possible solution that comes to mind is to use the capabilty in many pdf
readers of taking a snapshot of a rectangular area of a pdf page (rather
like cropping), which can then be saved separately as pdf, jpg or whatever.

For example, I use PDF-XChange (the snapshot tool is on the tool bar), open
XnView and Import Clipboard (in the Fle menu).  The image so created can
then be saved as you prefer.

Cheers,  Phil

Uwe raises a rather important issue here, and I am sorry that
I missed the message when it first appeared.  I recently asked
the TeX Live team why the TeXbook was not included in the TeX
Live distribution, and after a few off-beam responses I think
we finally arrived at the heart of the matter when Karl Berry
(TUG President) wrote :

> [T]he requirement is that everything in the [TeX Live] 
 > distribution be free according to the FSF definition.
> texbook.tex isn't.

So, the obvious source for a machine-readable copy of
the TeXbook (TeX Live) cannot contain such a copy, because
of the constraints that the TeX Live team have placed
on what can and cannot be included.  Fortunately,
TeX Live is not the only source of TeX.  Somewhat
larger (and now so large that it is no longer
distributed on CD or DVD, as far as I know) is CTAN
itself : the Comprehensive TeX Archive.  And of
course CTAN /does/ contain a machine-readable copy
of "The TeXbook", at

	http://ctan.org/get/systems/knuth/dist/tex/texbook.tex

However, once one has acquired that file and peered inside, one
reads :

> % This manual is copyright (C) 1984 by the American Mathematical Society.
> % All rights are reserved!
> % The file is distributed only for people to see its examples of TeX input,
> % not for use in the preparation of books like The TeXbook.
> % Permission for any other use of this file must be obtained in writing
> % from the copyright holder and also from the publisher (Addison-Wesley).
> \loop\iftrue
>   \errmessage{This manual is copyrighted and should not be TeXed}\repeat

so even when one has the source, one is not allowed to process it.

So to return to Uwe's question : "How can blind people access the TeXbook?",
the answer is "with great difficulty", if we assume that what he meant was
"/legally/ access the TeXbook?".  But surely in these enlightened days of
"equal access for all", there must be some legislation to cover issues such
as these ?  And I am reasonably certain that Don Knuth himself would not
want the copyright issue to be a bar that prevented blind people from gaining
access.  So what I suggest is that we raise this with the TUG Board (of which
I am a member), and ask whether they are willing to make representations
to DEK, to AMS and to A-W, asking for a blanket waiver to allow those to
whom a printed copy of the book is useless (such as those who are blind),
and who have a genuine need to consult the TeXbook, to be allowed to process
the machine-readable source (on condition, of course, that the resulting
DVI/PDF file is solely for their own use, and will never be passed on to others).

What do other TeXhax readers think ?

Well, I defer to those with direct experience of screen
readers and similar, but I would have /thought/ that
the result of PdfTeX'ing "texbook.tex" would result
in a document that is considerably more accessible
than the raw source.  Are there any screen-reader
users who could comment more informedly on this ?

the texbook file has no special facilities for
making it "accessible" in any meaningful way
as a pdf file, and i've decoded enough dvi files
to not wish that on anyone who's never tried to
do it before.  that leaves the file texbook.tex
itself for inspection via an editor with voice
output. and there's certainly no prohibition
against that.

would that not be a viable approach, if not
exactly trivial?

But you retained it.


Just use \marginpar{#1}.

Why don't you just use showkeys or similar package?

If you really need to roll your own, it will probably need some
\@bsphack and \@esphack to prevent double spaces in the text.

Hi folks,
A few comments:
1. "raw LaTeX" is by far the most accessible format. The information 
in a source file conveys exactly what appears in visual form in the 
PDF or the DVI. Moreover, there's nothing more liberating than 
producing professional quality documents with no sight.

2. To the best of my knowledge the law in England and Wales 
stipulates that the conversion of published materials into a format 
suitable for the blind or, people with other disabilities, is 
permissible so long as the converted materials are used for academic 
or generally non-commercial purposes.

3. I should forget PDF or, worse still, DVI. PDF specially is the 
opposite of everything raw LaTeX offers the blind.

No matter how much progress is made by the developers of screen 
readers somehow PDF remains less than accessible. It's a bit like 
failed relationship in which one partner tries to win the other back 
with expensive gifts.

Regards
Paul

I installed an upgrade of texshop and can no longer compile files.  I  
get the following error message.

Can't find required tool.

/usr/texbin/pdflatex does not exist. Perhaps TeXLive was not  
installed or was removed during a system upgrade. If so, go to the  
TeXShop web site and follow the instructions to (re)install TeXLive.  
Another possibility is that a tool path is incorrectly configured in  
TeXShop preferences. This can happen if you are using the fink teTeX  
distribution.

I went to your website to try to follow the instructions as directed,  
but I can't see how to do it.

Subject: [texhax] Legal documents in latex.
Message-ID: <4EDF3D69-2279-44DE-AB04-7CD78408FAE6@mac.com>

Hello everyone: I am currently in need of producing a massive amount  
of documents abiding to the legal rules implemented in Venezuela.  
However, I find myself unable to set them up properly because of  
(perhaps) an apparent lack of options.
Let me explain:
1. I use latex via Lyx and MacTex latest version.
2. I need to produce a twosided paper format with different margins  
and a different vertical measure of the total body in even and odd  
pages. The size of the full page is 216 width and 330mm height. The  
total body is 24.5cm height in all odd pages and of 28.1cm in all even  
pages. The inner and outer margins should be inverted (as normal with  
the twoside option). My problem is that I dont know how to change the  
total body for the text so it changes between odd and even pages. The  
geometry package does not allow this kind of arrangement.

This is the legal description of the paper I would need (its a rough  
translation from the spanish):

"The legal paper dimensions must be three hundred and thirty (330)  
millimeters long by two hundred and sixteen (216) millimeters wide,  
and must show printed at the top center (heading) the front Coat of  
Arms of the Republic, for the following orlado inscription: "Republic  
of Venezuela, rent, stamp duty. hundredth Two Units Value Tax (0.02  
UT). Also, will show the prints and signs of control may be determined  
by the Tax Administration.
The front (odd) page must have (30) horizontal lines for writing, each  
one hundred and seventy five (175) millimeters in length (wide),  
numbered at both ends of 1-30 on the odd side, and thirty-four (34 )  
horizontal lines for writing, each one hundred and seventy five (175)  
millimeters in length, numbered at both ends of 31 to 64 in every even  
side."

Could you help me please?

This is the tex preamble I currently have in my file (perhaps this  
jsut doesnt work).

Which TeX distribution are you using? Maybe is an old one or it might  
be Fink's or MacPorts. Do you have more than one distribution? Did you  
do an Archive and Install of your OS recently?

that is not how \includepdf work, each page og the pdf is included as a 
page (picture) of its own and placed in the background. Since the page 
will fill the entire page of your document, how would there be enough 
space on the current page?

A propos my previous question about showing labels, Donald Arsenau 
suggested using the package showkeys, which works beautifully.  Now I have 
another question.  It seems to me that there is a package that scans a 
file and finds unused macros, but I couldn't find it at CTAN.  Is there

    Tell that to the Authors Guild: 
    http://www.lessig.org/blog/2009/02/caving_into_bullies_aka_here_w.html

okay, thanks.
however, to clarify, i am sure that don knuth
would have no problem with someone using an
editor with voice output on the texbook file.
his specific prohibition is against typesetting
it.  however, the file does have this (more
restrictive) message in the heading:
  % The file is distributed only for people to see its examples of TeX input,
  % not for use in the preparation of books like The TeXbook.
  % Permission for any other use of this file must be obtained in writing
  % from the copyright holder and also from the publisher (Addison-Wesley).

i will inquire whether a "blanket" authorization
can be made for the case of blind users; i know
that permission has been granted in the past.

note to paul stanley:
victor eijkhout's book, "tex by topic", is
available from ctan in latex form.  there are
several files, located in
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/texbytopic/
although this really goes into the guts of tex,
is not in any way introductory, and doesn't
explain math usage, it might still be of
interest.  start by looking for "preface";
the book starts with a copy of the gnu license,
which isn't of \emph{tex}` interest.

We have used Word2TeX from Chikrii Softlab a lot.
It is a commerical product.  We paid about $100 (don't recall exactly)
for a licence.  It's probably a single-user licence, but that doesn't
matter to us, because we use it only rarely -- to convert large Word 
documents,
and once they are converted, we throw away the Word version.
The money we spent was more than saved in time, by getting LaTeX
output that was almost exactly what we needed.  (It wasn't perfect;
we still had to do significant amounts of tedious editing.)

Disclaimers:
We have no affiliation with Chikrii Softlab.
There may be other, perhaps free, tools that are just as good, but 
because we
need this thing so rarely we haven't spent any time look for or 
evaluating them.

Perhaps Open Office [1] also has such a feature ?

Abiword can read MD-Word .doc files and can output the file in Latex.
Probqably it tries to keep to much of the WORD file and the resulting
Latex files are very complicated.

OOo can import doc files and export LaTeX. You should save the doc file
as ODT from OOo before exporting to LaTeX.

You can also use OOo's LaTeX export from the commandline:

http://writer2latex.sourceforge.net/

LaTeX export can be easily configured by editing writer2latex.xml in
your home directory. See documentation for more details.

It's the native format of OOo. Exporting to LaTeX works without saving
to ODT beforehand, of course. But the ODT file is what writer2latex
works on. And there is no LaTeX import, vice versa. So if you need to
change anything you should recur to the ODT.

Ok, that's what I suspected.  There may be times when one wants to go
from a .doc to .tex without any other files.  There was a possibility,
suggested from what you wrote, that for some reason OOo had to write
the ODT before being able to create a .tex file.

In this case you won't use OOo because w2l only converts sxw/odt to LaTeX.

In fact, this is the case, but it is hidden from the user when calling
w2l from within OOo as an export filter. When applying w2l on the ODT
from the commandline, you have to save as ODT beforehand yourself.

Ah, got it, thanks.

So is there a way yet to get OOo to read a .doc file and spit out
LaTeX from the command line?  I always like wrapping up such things in
scripts - it's faster and simpler than launching a big application.

I don't know whether you can script OOo from the commandline... But OTOH
DOC is a doomed format because as from Windows 7 Wordpad does not
support DOC any more. Its successor is DOCX. Besides, ODT is supported.
So at least Windows users will slowly change to DOCX which means that it
will become easier to convert from MS Word to ODT which you then can
apply w2l to.

I've just come across wordml2latex, perhaps this is another solution for
those running MS Word 2003ff.:

Hi Leon,

    I have seen on your website a software review of ms word to latex
    conversion program. Unfortunately, I can not find it anymore. 

I believe the reviews you were remembering were written by Dave Walden
for The PracTeX Journal.
http://tug.org/pracjourn/2005-3/walden-travels/
http://tug.org/pracjourn/2005-4/walden

And, just for fun, here are all of Dave's columns (personally, one of my
favorite parts of TPJ) --
http://tug.org/pracjourn/authorindex/index.html#TAGW

Anyway ...

    Is there a recent better converter of this sort?

The page Uwe mentioned is the most comprehensive I know of.  "Better"
all depends on the job at hand ...

Best,
Karl

Greetings most exhalted LaTeX-sages

Having read an old math book, I was interested in knowing whether LaTeX might make cross-references like it did.

Surely LaTeX can do just about anything if you ask it the right way.

Here's what it looked like
___________________________

Chapter 1

text text text text 
text text text text 

Section 1

An equation

2+2 < 5                (1)

A reference to the equation 
now looks like: (1)

Section 2

text text text text 
text text text text 

A ref to the equation 
is now (1.1)

Chapter 2

text text text text 
text text text text 

A ref to the equation 
is now (1.1.1)

___________________________


Is there any way to make LaTeX make cross-references like that? A package? Or some arcane things?


Kind regards,

Christian Aastrup

I like the basic calendar; 

Does someone have the latex to create it?

I don't need the fancy tex demo stuff.

This probably would give some readers a bit of confusion since the
notation has changed.  I would design it to have the first reference
be (1.1) [section.equation] in all cases.

> Chapter 2

At this point I'm completely confused.  The third time one
would cite it as (1.1.1.1) and the fourth time (1.1.1.1.1)?

(I'll let others say how to do these things technically.)

What Christian wants (I believe) is for Equations to be labeled as (1), (2),
..., and within the same section in which they are first displayed, they
would be referred to as Equation (1), etc. When referring to Equations in a
different section, but in the same chapter, it would display Equation (1.2)
for the second equation in the first section. When referring to equations in
a different chapter, it would display Equation (1.2.3) for the third
equation in the second section of the first chapter.

Although I'm out of my league here, I envision a solution wherein you
redefine the \theequation command, and use the ifthen package to exame the
\section and \chapter of the current location, compare with the location of
the equation, and display different results accordingly. Something like:

\def\theequation {%
\ifthenelse{ \equal{\chapter}{\Eq_chapter} }% If same chapter
   {\ifthenelse{ \equal{\section}{\Eq_section} }% and same section
      {\equation}% print just the number.
      {\Eq_section.\equation}% If different section, print section number as
well
   }% If different chapter, print the chapter and section numbers
   {\Eq_chapter.\Eq_section.\equation} }

Hopefully I closed all my brackets. The only thing that you're missing now
is how to figure out in what chapter/section an equation begins (I made up
the commands \Eq_chapter and \Eq_section). Hopefully someone else can post
that information.

Cheers,
Bob Wilson

Hi Doug,

    Does someone have the latex to create it?

It uses a very slightly hacked version of
ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/calendar.

If you want the actual sources (minus the big images I guess), I'm happy
to send them to you.

Karl

Hi Bob and everyone

You've understood exactly what I'm looking for and perhaps you've explained better. 

I sure hope that someone out there knows how to implement this.

  What Christian wants (I believe) is for Equations to be labeled as (1), (2), ..., and within the same section in which they are first displayed, they would be referred to as Equation (1), etc. When referring to Equations in a different section, but in the same chapter, it would display Equation (1.2) for the second equation in the first section. When referring to equations in a different chapter, it would display Equation (1.2.3) for the third equation in the second section of the first chapter.

  Although I'm out of my league here, I envision a solution wherein you redefine the \theequation command, and use the ifthen package to exame the \section and \chapter of the current location, compare with the location of the equation, and display different results accordingly. Something like:

  \def\theequation {%
  \ifthenelse{ \equal{\chapter}{\Eq_chapter} }% If same chapter
     {\ifthenelse{ \equal{\section}{\Eq_section} }% and same section
        {\equation}% print just the number.
        {\Eq_section.\equation}% If different section, print section number as well
     }% If different chapter, print the chapter and section numbers
     {\Eq_chapter.\Eq_section.\equation} }

  Hopefully I closed all my brackets. The only thing that you're missing now is how to figure out in what chapter/section an equation begins (I made up the commands \Eq_chapter and \Eq_section). Hopefully someone else can post that information.

  Cheers,
  Bob Wilson

    This probably would give some readers a bit of confusion since the
    notation has changed.  I would design it to have the first reference
    be (1.1) [section.equation] in all cases.

    At this point I'm completely confused.  The third time one
    would cite it as (1.1.1.1) and the fourth time (1.1.1.1.1)?

    (I'll let others say how to do these things technically.)

If you can save as an rtf there is a program rtf2latex2e 
that yields passable results. Kword (with KDE office suite) 
pretends to save in latex format but does a horrible job.

Subject: [texhax] LaTeX : Section opening recto, verso blank
Message-ID: <49BB8265.60200@Rhul.Ac.Uk>

Dear Colleagues -- For a forthcoming book, I would
like opening section pages to invariably have a
blank verso counterpart.  I am currently using
the following options and packages :

     %&pdflatex

     \RequirePackage {fix-cm}
     \documentclass [a4paper, landscape, twoside, twocolumn]{book}

     \usepackage [compact, center]{titlesec}
     \usepackage {balance} % not used, causes loss of marks
     \usepackage {fixltx2e}
     \usepackage {fix1stcolmarks} % written here
     \usepackage {fancyhdr}
     \usepackage {transparent}
     \usepackage {oldstyle}
     \usepackage [pdftex]{graphicx}
     \usepackage [greek, english]{babel}
     \usepackage {teubner}
     \usepackage [colorlinks]{hyperref}
     \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
     \usepackage[urw-garamond]{mathdesign}

and sections have been designated as being of
class "top" (titlesec) in order to force them
to start recto.

I would be very grateful if anyone could suggest how
this could best be achieved without manually inserting
\clearpage or \cleardoublepage commands (i.e., I would
like the code to determine algorithmically if the previous
section has finished verso, and if so, to leave two blank
pages).

Many thanks in advance :
Philip TAYLOR

The logic is about right but applied to the wrong object.

Well, it would be nice, if it worked like that ... but ...

Here is an example of how the \label command puts the info away in the aux
file:

\newlabel{eq:mellin}{{5.1.10}{55}}

That is, 5.1.10 is the equation number labelled "eq:mellin" and 55 is the
page on which it appeared.

So, what is really needed is a macro that parses the number retreived and
chops the unnecessary bits off.

Good luck!

Indeed, for example, is eq 3.2.1  the first equation of the second section
of chapter three, or the first equation of the second subsection of section
three of the current chapter, or the first equation of the second
subsubsection of subsection three of the current section, or ...?

In other words, the same depth of sub...subsections has to be maintained
throughout - hard to do.

Most books where I have seen this convention, do not have subsections. 
Just chapters and sections, so the above confusion does not arise.

According to my understanding of titlesec, you want to have sections of 
titlesec class "page" (like standard \part), not "top" (like standard 
\chapter). With such a declaration, you needn't care any more about 
\clear... Actually, \cleardoublepage skips the next page if it is even 
(\if at twoside), so there is no need for an extra algorithm deciding whether 
to \clearpage or to \cleardoublepage.

The beamer user guide is a very rich and detailed document but it

Ah, sorry, I misunderstood `counterpart', and I overlooked the explanations 
`finished verso' and `two blank pages':

I understood `counterpart' as `verso of starting folio' (cf. thread 
identifier). And when I started the present reply, I thought `counterpart' 
meant `end of the same section'. OK, I am sticking to `counterpart' as 
`opposite page'.

So just add \null right before \LaTeXcleardoublepage.

1b. To get the "empty indeed" variant of \cleardoublepage, titlesec offers 
option `clearempty'. There also is package `emptypage' to the same effect 
without titlesec. But you are right, both packages miss \columnseprule = 
0pt (maybe because \columnseprule = 0pt is standard anyway).

1c. One might want to keep the "weak" \cleardoublepage for "subsections" 
and give a new name to your variant, e.g. \cleardoublepageskiponepage (but 
this conflicts with my proposal below).

It seems to me that I understand titlesec better here than you, although I 
didn't know what it does until yesterday.

With

     \titleclass{\section}{top}

you don't need \cleardoublepage in \Section, because this \titleclass 
declaration makes \section execute \doubleclearpage! Seen from code and 
tested! This is what \titleclass has been made for!
This was the heart of my previous message:

Yes, that was what I meant by "verso counterpart" : the facing
(verso) page.

That gives me unwanted pages at start of document.

Well, as neither of these solve the problem of the rule,
I may as well roll my own, because I need the rule
problem solved !

Ah, but I don't yet have a variant that solves the
problem : the cleardoublepage of mine simply
does what the original should have done -- ensures
that the verso page is completely blank, /unless/
that page contains real typesettable content.  And
it is that latter problem that is what this thread
is about : how, if the verso page contains real
typesettable content, to ensure that the next section
start not just recto, but recto+2, so that the verso
counterpart of the opening section page is blank.

Confused : not sure what you are saying here ...  Does this refer
to my '"page" not only generates an "opening chapter style" page' ?

Anyhow, a resume of where we are, after incorporating your suggestions :

Adding \null just before \LaTeXcleardoublepage causes unwanted
blank pages at start of document.

\cleardoublepage in the definition of \Section was indeed
an error, but it does need an explicit \clearpage, otherwise
\sectiontype is set too soon and affects the running head
of the current page (the running head should change
only as the new section starts).

Using titleclass "page" gives me content-free opening
section pages; I need opening section pages to have
content below the heading.

Many thanks for all your help, Uwe, but as you can
see, we're clearly not there yet !

As a "counterpart" to the final summary below, I start with my own summary, 
may be better than those dialogs spanning screens:

1. My earlier suggestion \titlceclass{\section}{page} was wrong, due to my 
misunderstanding of `counterpart', obsolete. I recommend Phil's original 
\titleclass{\section}{top} instead.

2. If the additional \null that I suggested earlier really generates empty 
pages no. 1 etc., replace it by \ifnum\value{page}>1\null\fi or so ...

Fine, thank you Uwe.  This does indeed produce results
far closer to my needs than any previous version, and
I will now look to see if I can get Sections (and Subsections,
which I had not previously mentioned, but which too are
of class "top") to open verso when appropriate, whilst
ensuring that Chapters continue to open recto as before.

The reference to \value was also very useful; I was
unaware of its existence.

Opening verso contradicts the thread identifier and is not supported by 
titlesec. You might not use \titlesec{\section} at all and instead use 
\def\Section{\clearpage\null\newpage...}. (It may be difficult to fit this 
sectioning level into the order that titlesec creates.) BTW the emptypage 
package has an option `odd' on which all chapters open verso (never recto).

-- Uwe.

Agreed, but I don't think one should be too constrained
by such considerations : if an option which wasn't
previously considered seems attractive after productive
discussion, then surely one should consider it ?

OK, thank you for the information.  What I /suspect/ I now need
is the "openany" option to \documentclass, and to augment the
\chapter macro (via \Chapter) to open recto.  I will then need
to take care of sections that end verso as before, since they
will need to be followed by a blank recto, but now that I know
about \value {page} from your preceding message, it should
be fairly easy (using \ifodd) to work out where one is in
the spread.

Thank you, Uwe : as far as I can see, "page" not
only generates an "opening chapter style" page
(which I don't want, for sections) but it also
doesn't solve the problem of a section finishing
verso -- the next section starts recto on the
same spread (sample attached).

My thanks to all who offered suggestions; sadly we don't
yet seem to have arrived at a solution !  As one or two
of my correspondents were not sure exactly what I was
setting out to achieve, I attach a PDF spread illustrating
the problem.

The section on Incunabula finishes verso, at p.~134;
the section on Cryptographs commences recto, at p.~135.
Because of the ugliness of the two when seen side-by-side,
I would like the code to detect that the Incunabula
section has finished verso, and to cause the section
on Cryptographs to commence recto not on p.~135 as at
present, but rather on p.~137  In fact, I would even
settle for the section on Cryptographs starting verso
on p.~136 (i.e., sections can open verso), so long
as chapters continue to open recto.

Maybe you can get better help in the MiKTeX mailing list. But anyway,  
what version of MiKTeX are you using?

Have you verified your MiKTeX settings?:

Programs -> MiKTeX (2.7?) -> Settings -> Packages tab -> Package  
repository (click in Change...), verify that ``Packages shall be  
installed from the Internet'' is selected, click in ``Connection  
Settings'' and verify everything is as it should.

Hope you can get better help here or in the MiKTeX forums or whatever  
(I'm not a MiKTeX ---nor Windows--- user).

Best,

Axel

Sorry about that. Hope someone knows what the problem might be. But  
also consider MiKTeX's mailing list:

https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/miktex-users

Remember to specify which MikTeX version you're using.

Best,

Hi,

Whenever I compile my input file and have errors in it, these are indicated in the Output Latex Profile window and references are made in relation to the line number(s) where these errors occur.

Even with an input file that is not too long, it is cumbersome to count the lines to identify the line refered to.

Is there a way to have line numbers of the input file indicated in the input file window so one can readily identify the lien refered to?

I am using TeXnicCenter

Thank you for your ki nd attention

very well hidden in one of TeXnic Centers configuration menus you will 
find a tickbox to activate line numbers.

Though, I cannot remember where it is located, though I know it is there.

That definition looks fine, with no spurious spaces or breakpoints

This example doesn't demonstrate how you type it when punctuation
is involved, so I will have to guess that you use
"test \pdobj{object-sd-clip} , text" or "test \pdobj{object-sd-clip}
, text" (with a line-break rather than a space).  Of course the
space before the comma allows the line break in the typeset
output.  Replace that space with "~", or omit it altogether.

> > > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur....so using this method the {object},

This example has no space, and the definition has no break point, 
so there is some other factor involved.  Did you "simplify" the
definition?

Of course the word "encoding" should be changed to the 
actual character encoding used for the input file.

OK, that shows the input encoding is not "latin1", alias
ISO 8859-1.  Maybe the input files use another in the 8859
series (a summary can be found at 
http://www.terena.org/activities/multiling/ml-docs/iso-8859.html

Another possibility is a Microsoft variant character set, usually
quoted as "code-page <number>", in which case use
  \usepackage[cp1252]{inputenc} 
or
  [cp850] ??

But unicode UTF-8 is the most likely candidate, so I suggest
your friend try 
  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} 
or, perhaps try
  \usepackage{ucs}
  \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc} 


If they don't work, maybe the text file is in some other encoding, 
and the text editor will tell what it is, or maybe someone will
need to look at it, or maybe even there are stray binary bytes
mixed in with the input characters.

I don't know TeXnicCenter at all, but you should look for `options' or 
`settings' (or `edit settings' or ...).

Very generally, there are three kinds of accessing line numbers in editors:
1. You may find a `go to' function in some menu where you can enter the 
line number where to go to.
2. The file content window may have a column displaying the numbers of the 
lines displayed (to be activated in the settings).
3. The window may display somewhere the line number where the cursor is 
(plus the number of the character in the line). This may be in some "status 
line", and it may be necessary to *activate* displaying that "status line". 
The format of the line number may be cryptical, it may be necessary that 
somebody points at it with his finger so you realize that it's the line 
number ...

Message-ID: <dc2c99d0903191102h5dfc1b54p8247b48be93e8812@mail.gmail.com>

I have a question that seems to me like it should be fairly
straight-forward, but I can't find the magic solution.

I am writing a paper in APA style using the header:

\documentclass[man]{apa}

When I place tables in my document, this style automatically places all
tables at the end of the document (while in [man] mode). However, I would
really like for my tables to appear in the text of my document.  After
researching table floats and placement, I used:

\begin{table}[h]   -and-  \begin{table}[!h]

to force the table to appear in the body of the text, but to no avail. Is
there something that I am not trying?  Thank you so much for any help you
can provide.

If you're using TeXLive 2008 (maybe with MiKTeX is the same), in your  
terminal or Command Prompt type

texdoc apacls<enter>

(the document is in

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/apa/apacls.html ).

See especially, about the middle of the document, the section ``Float  
placement, loading, and content''.

I'm glad you like it. But if you are interested in an RSS feed rather
than following the feed via microblogging I think you'd better use the
original RSS from the Mail Archive or from Gmane because it's much more
reliable than the RSS feeds microblogging services provide...

http://www.mail-archive.com/ctan-ann at dante.de/maillist.xml

That's the feed that goes into the twitterfeed.

BTW, I prefer Identi.ca to Twitter because the former is a free service
and all notives there are published under CC-by license while Twitter is
a proprietary service.

The original message clearly identified itself as one from the list
"Precedence: list" and any auto-responder should ignore such emails
(and emails from other auto-responders, mailer-daemons and other

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0903231431490.22551@tyr.diku.dk>

Hi,

I need to run TeX in a chroot jail in order to allow non-trusted users to 
LaTeX documents on a server of mine.

I would be very happy if someone on this list could provide pointers to 
mailing lists, howtos, or web sites where such sandboxing of TeX is 
discussed.

Alternatively, I would be happy to get pointers to small, robust TeX 
installations which run under Linux. The TeX installation needs to be 
small because I construct a new chroot jail from scratch each time TeX is 
going to run. On the other hand, the small TeX installation needs not be 
"complete" in any sense because my users can add whatever sty-files, 
font-files, and so on they would like to have in their private jail. But I 
would need a TeX installation which comprises LaTeX, BibTeX, Makeindex, 
dvipdfm, and the Computer Modern fonts.

Cheers,
Klaus

My home is not on NFS - but from running it via -kpathsea-debug=-1 (you dont wanna see the logfile it contains hundred thousand of lines) I see that it is searching for something. It walks through my whole homedirectory (which currently is freakingly big).

So what is the root cause of this?

Hi,

as far as I can see schroot should be perfect for you. It allows to setup a 
chroot and give limited user access to it. Thus, a user can use "schroot 
latex" to compile a latex file. 
Please check the man pages of schroot ... web-search should spill out many 
useful links.

However, I do not know what is the nature of your user access. There are 
physical available in front of your machine ? Or will they log in by ssh?
If the second is the point you might like to use one of the virtual machines 
concepts allow a own ip-address for your "tex-machine" and a (as most as 
possible) completed closed environment encapsulated from your host 
environment. 

Some, which I used already ordered from simple (less overhead) complex (much 
set-up work paid off by many bells and whistles)
 
schroot aka chroot (strictly spoken not a vm, but very less computational 
overhead)

VServer (like a chroot on drugs :) )

VirtualBox (rather easy set-up but more gui-based on both host and clients)

Xen (this might requires a complete reinstall of your server machine)  

There a many many more 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_platform_virtual_machines
might be a good overview to start with.

In addition the usage of lvm is imho very helpful. Every machine can get a own 
partition to live in, easy maintainable and changeable over time from the host 
system.

Some of the virtual machine concepts allow sophisticated forking of a virtual 
environment. You just have to set-up onces a main system and only have to 
maintain this single system, however, every user might like to start a own 
machine to work within. If you like to isolated them (both users and machines) 
strictly from each other this might be what you want. 
There might be smaller to bigger overheads with one or the other solution but 
as far as computer power goes nowadays this should be not a significant 
problem, unlike we talk about concurrent users fare more then several dozen.

Hope that helps a bit

Totti 

CC. As far as I know LaTeX and friends should feel homely in any of the above 
solutions. :)

huh, did you actually install MikTeX during the installation?

have you tried searching for miktex on your Vista?

it might be programs/miktex 2.7/miktex/bin

or something like that

(yes it is quite anoying that TeXnicCenter cannot foind LaTeX on its own)

Thanks for the pointer. schroot definitely looks promissing.

I have two security problems.

One is to give access to LaTeX through a web formula to untrusted users. I 
do that at http://logiweb.eu/logiweb/tutorial/submit.html. But in that 
case I can use chroot.

The other problem is that end users of my "Logiweb" application may not 
have root privileges and need a clean jail containing LaTeX when they need 
to cache a "Logiweb page" locally (a "Logiweb page" is a mixture of LaTeX 
and computer code in the tradition of literate programming, and "Logiweb" 
is something like a web2c which uses the Internet as repository). In this 
case schroot looks *perfect*.

For the end user problem above I need a small LaTeX installation so that I 
can make a fresh jail for each run af LaTeX. If I just put all TeX related 
files on a standard Ubuntu install in a chroot jail then the jail ends up 
being 72Mb. I will benchmark schroot to see if that is small enough, but 
if you happen to know smaller TeX installations, I would be very 
interested. Alternatively, one may of course clean and reuse jails, but 
such an approach has its own problems.

Certainly, thanks a lot for the pointers.

I sent this message to the pdftex mailing list some days ago but got no reply.

With the pdftex commands `\pdfoutline' and `\pdfdest' I produce outlines in a
left subwindow in the pdf output file.

It seems to work fine, except that in math symbols the dollar is shown as it
is: `$'.

How to work that out?  Isn't it possible to write TeX math symbols within
outlines?

Thanks for any help

Good morning,

I'am a nembye with mac os x and tex shop I find very easy to use.

However I have a problem to insert a new package "floatfig" to define  
floating figures

I make a new directory in /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/latex  
call "floatfig" and insert the floatfig.sty inside.
This directory or this file in not find during the compilation of my  
document.
Should I inform Txshop that a new package is available but where ??

Thanks for your answer.
Best Regards

Christine

Call for papers: Towards a Digital Mathematics Library (DML 2009)
July 8-9th, 2009, Ontario, CA c/o CICM 2009

Workshop webpage:
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/dml-2009.html

Deadlines: April 29th: abstract submissions 
           May 4th: paper submissions 
           May 22nd: paper acceptance/rejection decision
           May 29th: versions for the proceedings due
           Jul 8th: workshop date, proceedings on site

Submissions:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=dml2009
Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, 
potential impact for building DML, and clarity. Final paper versions should
conform to the Springer LNCS (llncs class) style, preferably using LaTeX2e.

Submission categories:
Full paper: 4-12 LNCS pages
Short paper/poster/work in progress report: 1-4 LNCS pages 

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects, 
asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow [CEDRAM/Euclid model])?

Proceedings:
will be published by Masaryk University and will be available on site,
with best papers chosen for postconference proceedings published
by renowned publisher or for journal.

Keynote (conditioned by funding approval):

No, don't do that ---don't put anything inside /usr/local/texlive/ 
2008... Your local additions should go in /usr/local/texlive/texmf- 
local/ (that is, for a LaTeX package, /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/ 
tex/latex), and you have to run in Terminal

sudo texhash

for (La)TeX to recognize your addition. Also, you can put it in

~/Library/texmf/tex/latex (~/Library means the Library directory of  
your Home). You don't have to run texhash for anything you put here.

I don't know the floatfig package, but isn't it old? I would advise  
you to subscribe to the TeX on Mac OS mailing list:

you probably forgot at update the file database, try running

texhash

(perhaps sudo texhash to run it as admin)

BTW: you might want to update your LaTeX dist using tlmgr (tex live 
manager), usually you can get a gfx version using

tlmgr --gui

And I wondered why it is not in TeXLive. Answer seems to be (cf. 
ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html and ctan.tug.org/pkg):

floatfig is obsolete, doesn't work with LaTeX2e, superseded by floatflt, 
which *is* in TeXLive. There are also wrapfig and picinpar (picins seems to 
be missing as well).

No, unfortunately no, or not any more ---I guess it's not ``free'' as  
required by TL.

What I've been happily using for quite some time is wrapfig, which I  
learned to use in The LaTeX Companion, 2nd ed, because you don't get  
much documentation ---part in the package itself and part in

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/wrapfig/multiple-span.txt

Message-ID: <8f1b7b690903261727n575f98e0y611c7914477499f7@mail.gmail.com>

Fellow listers,

This is not really a tex question per se, but I would appreciate any
suggestion on how one references a magazine/periodical article where
no author is provided.? For example, The Economist does not list
article authors in its issues, so I am struggling how to create a
suitable Bibtex entry.? Several web searches led to using "No Author
Given" but this seems very strange when you see it listed in the work
as in No Author Given (2007).? Can anyone share an alternative
approach?

Here is how my current Bibtex entry appears for one of the offending
references to the Economist:

@MISC{Econ032208Wal,
AUTHOR = {{No author given}},
TITLE ={Leaders: {W}all {S}treet's Crisis},
HOWPUBLISHED = Econ,
YEAR = 2008,
MONTH = {March 22,},
NOTE = {March 22}
}
%PAGES = {11}

Any thoughts greatly appreciated!

Tom

Well, for what my thoughts are worth (and with my thoughts and two  
bob you
can make a phone call --- well, you *used* to be able to) I would  
suggest
that you list the author as ``The Economist''.  Then the citation in
your paper would look like The Economist (2007) --- which looks O.K.
to me.

But what do *I* know?

	cheers,

Rather than "No author given" or repeating the journal name, use "Anon."
or "Anonymous" which is perfectly acceptable practice in the
circumstances.

There are also artex, bundledoc according to

     http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic#bundling

and fink and texdepend according to

         http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic#combine

However, I am unable to tell from the descriptions whether they generate 
absolute path names.

Moreover, there were two postings on snapshot and bundledoc here January 
2008, thread `Long-term stability of LaTeX documents?'.

Sorry, I can inform myself on GNU autotools; I just couldn't believe that 
such a tool could be independent of TeX. -- Uwe.

Hi Tom,

just a quick idea. If you use your own bibtex style-file. You might just add a 
new entry which contains no author fields and assign the records in your bib-
file to this new style-scheme. 

If you don't use a own style-file already, check which file you use now 
(something.bst) search for it in the tex-path, copy it into your personal 
folder, rename it to e.g. my_something.bst. Open the file. Copy the function 
for "article" and rename it definition modify the copy to your needs. E.g.

FUNCTION {article_noa}
{ output.bibitem
  format.title "title" output.check
  crossref missing$
    { journal article.in.journal output.nonnull
      new.sentence
      format.vol.year.num.pages output
      format.url output
    }
    { format.article.crossref output.nonnull }
  if$
  format.online.lastcheck
  doi set.period.dash.check
  urn set.period.dash.check
  format.doi.urn output
  issn set.period.dash.check
  format.isbn.issn output
  note set.period.dash.check
  note output
  fin.entry
}
an article without authors might look in the bibfile like below  

@ARTICLE_NOA{cite_keyword_1,
  title = {About the sense of articles without authors...},
  journal = {Miracle and Science},
  year = {1845},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {1360--1365},
  number = {12},
  month = {Dec},
}

Dont't forget to tell TeX to use your new style-file with
\bibliographystyle{my_something} in the TeX-header.

That might work or not ;) I didn't test it. Hope that helps.

Best regards,

Totti

Hey Diego I found your post a tex user site (pasted below).  I had the same question.  I realize its been some time, but just in case you still want a solution I figured something out which works, though it is not very elegant... (neither of the renewcommands worked by itself to solve the issue)

\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\roman{enumi}}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\roman{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate}

\item some point

\item \label{needRefLaterA} some point referred to later

\item another point

\item \label{needRefLaterB} another point referred to later

\item point which refers to item \ref{needRefLaterA} and item \ref{needRefLaterB}.

\end{enumerate}

How about outside the enumerate block can I still refer to items \ref{needRefLaterA} and \ref{needRefLaterB}?


HERES HOW IT TURNED OUT IN THE PDF...
i. some point
ii. some point referred to later
iii. another point
iv. another point referred to later
v. point which refers to item ii and item iv.
How about out the enumerate block can I still refer to items ii and iv?


YOUR POST FROM 2006 ....

Hello there,

I've created a list with roman numerals using the commands:

\begin{list} {\Roman{enumi}.}
{usecounter}{enumi}}
   item \label{aaa}...
   ...
\end{list}

However, when I want to make a reference to one of the
items in that list, i.e.

\ref{aaa}

I get printed the value of the counter in arabic numerals
instead of the Roman version. Is there a way for changing this
value to Romans?

Thanks,
Diego Ruiz

I am having trouble getting images to appear in my pdf file. Currently I
am using the graphicx package with the pdftex option. 

I am using the following:
\begin{figure}

\caption{Past (1981-2009) AAC for the Quesnel TSA. Source:

But all that displays in the pdf is a box outline of the image and the
filename inside the box.

you might want to learn the enumitem package, easy donciguration for 
each list, and the references can be configureed (actually it is the 
default) to remember the formatting, i.e. i the number comes out (iv), 
then the reference will be (iv) including the ()'s

Subject: [texhax] \nobreak adds undesired vertical glue
Message-ID: <87prg1l0wf.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi to all (La)TeX users.

At a certain point of a text, I need inserting a `\nobreak' to prevent page
breaking.  But then some undesired vertical glue is added by plain TeX.  Is it
possible to avoid that, and how?

Thanks for any help
Rodolfo

Between September and late February. we were able to find unsecured sites that we could reach from an apartment in Ano Ilissia and thus handle our small email needs (much of it TeXhax), but the party seems to be over.? Not only are all sites reduced to 20% signal strength at best, they seem to be either secured to WPA2 or too flakey to carry POP mail traffic.? 



Can anyone here in Greece suggest (private reply, because I doubt TeXhax wants to see the gory details) what would be the best approach for a three-month connection.? There is an OTE land-line in the apartment, so that may boost the OTE - DSL option rather high in the list of options.? 



Would we be facing physical alteration of the OTE line?? Would there be a serious early termination cost if the next tenants in the apartment decided not to continue?

I correct myself: it's not that \nobreaks adds extra vertical glue, but that it
shrinks the text that follows in the current paragraph.  Can anybody explain
why?

That use of \footline is in the TeXbook. Anyway, that's all right: you can
cancel line 56, it's not important for our purpose.

The problem (whatever it is) is not at line 56
(\footline = ...) but earlier, and I do not
want to have to debug your code before I can
help you with your problem.  Please send
a document that compiles /without changes/
and which demonstrates the problem, and I will
then willingly look at it.

In his defence, it compiles fine here without changes. (Kubuntu 64-bit
texlive.)

I have no idea how to solve his problem, but I don't think it's that the
code he posted is buggy and won't compile.

I think this is the best place to post your question ---either the  
author himself or another member of the list might have the solution  
you're looking for.

Just try to be very specific about your problem; and if you can post a  
minimal example, all the better.

Best,

Axel

Hi,
I am writing my thesis and came across a problem with using the chapterbib
package.

My problem is, with the chapterbib package, I manage to have a list of
references at the end of each chapter, but the \cite command doesn't seem to
work properly. I get a "question mark" (?) wherever I have a citation on all
the chapters except in the last chapter. Should I use someother command
instead of \cite when using chapterbib? I am a beginner to latex, and am
using a PhD dissertation template written by someone else.

I would be very grateful to you if you could help me resolve this problem.

Thank you very much.

Kind Regards,
Chintha.

Not really, it doesn't shrink text.  It causes (shrinkable) vertical
glue to shrink, see below.

When you add \nobreak, TeX has two options.  First, it can take the
first line of the following paragraph and fit it on the same page as
the heading line (and maybe more than one line, depending on your
settings of \clubpenalty; in your case, it also has to fit the
displayed formula).  Or, TeX can just move the heading line to the
next page, to keep it with the following paragraph.  TeX decides that
the former is more pleasing to the eye (actually, it decides that it
better satisfies the restrictions you specified), probably because
without \nobreak the glue on that page was already stretched quite a
bit.

Why TeX only puts the beginning of that paragraph on page 1 when you
specify \nobreak?  Because \nobreak adds penalty to the glue, and that
causes recalculation of the "merits" of the viable pagebreaks.
Without the added penalty, those lines weren't "good enough" to fit on
page 1; with the penalty, it became "more attractive" than to move the
heading line to the next page.

HTH,
Oleg

How odd : it also compiles OK on a more recent
(but still TeX Live 2008 under Windows) installation
here.  Thank you for pointing out that there was
no problem with the original : I shall now look
at the \nobreak problem.

No, \nobreak doesn't shrink text either.  (...unless you redefined it)

Two things it might do:

1) Prevents page breaks (gasp!) that fit the page better, forcing
TeX to use alternate break points that do not fit as well.  In order
for the page contents to fit, flexible glue will stretch or shrink.

2) It can hide vskips that come above it if you do things with \lastskip.
I don't see any use of \lastskip in what you posted.

I know this is not the reply most people want, but it really does help to
read the manual.

Anyway, with chapterbib you need to run BibTeX on each file that is
\include'd and tha contains citations and then, of course, run LaTeX twice.
Other than this, it's hard to imagine what you might be doing wrong.

And, by the way, the manual is in the package itself, after the code;  
in TeXLive 2008, the package (chapterbib.sty) is in

/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/latex/cite/

kpsewhich chapterbib.sty

in your terminal or Command Prompt can help you find the file in other  
distributions (TeXLiive 2007, MiKTeX).

Hi,

I haven't received my TeXlive 2008 disk yet, but I'd like to upgrade my

Unfortunately, the older packages are still on the Ubuntu package site.

 What's the best way to do upgrade my system now?

Does MikTeX provide kpsewhich?  I ask because people told me that
MikTeX is _not_ based on web2c but I still don't know what this means.
It certainly doesn't mean that Christian is using a Pascal compiler
instead of converting the web sources to C.  I'm a little bit confused.

Hi David,

    I haven't received my TeXlive 2008 disk yet, 

Were you a member in 2008?  You certainly should have received it in
that case.  I see you sent the registration form for 2009 (but didn't
see it in 2008), but that gets the 2009 TeX Live, not automatically the
2008 DVD -- that's an option.  Confusing, I know, but we haven't been
able to find a clearer way to handle it.

Anyway, please feel free to write office-admin at tug.org and we'll
straighten out any membership stuff.  Thanks for your support!
    
    but I'd like to upgrade my TeXlive 2007 installation on my linux
    system (Kubuntu 8.10, KDE 4.2, AMD-64).  Unfortunately, the older
    packages are still on the Ubuntu package site.

     What's the best way to do upgrade my system now?

If you have a decent net connection, the best way is to download the net
installer and run it.  It'll install under /usr/local (by default) and
hence not conflict with anything the system provides.
See http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html for info.

Best regards,
Karl

Typically, you would install the .sty file in your home directory, as  
follows.
   - in ~/Library/, create the directory 'texmf'.
   - the directory structure under ~/Library/texmf mirrors
     that of the global TeX directory structure
   - in my system, I have these directories
      bibtex  doc  tex
   - in ~/Library/tex, I have
     context  generic  latex  lib  plain

The .sty files go into one of the directories here.

Note that this will provide whatever you install for your own use.  To  
make it globally usable (if you have multiple users on your system),  
you will have to install it in the corresponding system directory, or  
in each user's local tree, as above.

If you install something in the global TeX tree, you have to rebuild  
the system's database of TeX knowledge, using 'texhash', run as  
"root".  If you install it in your (or other's) local trees, this is  
not necessary.

MacTeX is just a TeX distribution, with the addition of some Mac OS X- 
specific GUI applications.  I don't think there is a manual for this,  
but there is a 'readme' file in the directory where the latter are  
installed (/Applications/TeX).  You should read that first, and follow  
the pointers there.

A couple of things will help you with the simpler questions:
  - <http:faq.tug.org> - a FAQ page to answer some questions
  - the command 'kpsewhich' (type "man kpsewhich" at your
    shell prompt) can tell you whether 'pstricks.sty' or
    any other file is installed on your system (and where
    it is).

I don't think there's anyone manning the support phone lines :-}.   
Visit the TUG website (<http://www.tug.org>), where there is a link to  
a mailing list page that describes the various lists available, and  
provides links to sign-up pages.

The caption package seems to me the help you need. In your terminal or  
Command Prompt, do

texdoc caption-eng

You can do almost anything you want with it.

Actually, in a footnote on page 11 of the manual the author states: "Only
fixed widths are supported here; if you are looking for a way to limit the
width of the caption to the width of the figure or table, please take a look
at the floatrow [8] or threeparttable [22] package."

You're right. I thought you could change it locally with a  
\captionsetup{margin=xx}, but I just tried it, and, no, you can't.

Thanks for clarifying this point.

one problem though, is that some ubuntu packages require LaTeX, and if 
you do not want to have both TeXLive 2007 (from Ubuntu) and TeX Live 
2008 (from TUG) installed at the same time, you will need to do a little 
work (I did it last week and it works fine).

Uninstall all texlive packages from Ubuntu (a bit tedious from Synaptic).

Install TeX Live 2008 somewhere on your system.

Use equivs to build a special package that will tell Ubuntu that 
packages similar to a large number of Ubuntu packages have already been 
installed. Now an editor like TeXMaker can be installed without 
instisting that one have to install latex as well.

Manuel P?gouri?-Gonnard explained it (in French) in 
http://weblog.elzevir.fr/2008/11/tex-live-2008-a-la-vanille-sur-debian-like/

I did a much longer explanation (in Danish) in
http://www.imf.au.dk/system/latex/artikler/tl2008_i_ubuntu.html

Miktex provides an application _called_ kpsewhich, but it is an
alias of findtexmf:

I:>kpsewhich -version
MiKTeX Finder 2.7.2824 (MiKTeX 2.7)

I:>findtexmf -version
MiKTeX Finder 2.7.2824 (MiKTeX 2.7)

That seems perfectly reasonable to me.  By removing \nobreak, you
are allowing TeX to break the page following

	Insieme aperto e chiuso.

and TeX says "Fine, that looks like a good place to break the
page to me" (in fact, "the best place"), and breaks there.
Why does this behaviour puzzle you ?

And if this is not the behaviour you are seeking, then perhaps
you should described exactly what it is you are trying to achieve,
because at the moment your code appears to do exactly what one
would expect it to ...

Hi there,

Using natbib is there anyways to have multiple reference lists within a
single document which occur at the end of section or subsection?

So it would look some like this:

Section

Text within that section (Smith 2009)

References

Smith, J. 2009. Etc, etc.

And then the next section would be a new section and new citations which are
listed at the end of the section.

Thanks in advance!

Sam

Hi Ulrike,
many thanks.  I assume that if it can be invoked as "kpsewhich", it's
actually the same thing.  Another question:  Does MikTeX's updmap
supports the --enable option now?  AFAIK, MiKTeX 2.4 didn't.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Funny you should ask, we just had a posting on the use of chapterbib.

Hi, 

Search on the Internet for information regarding "floatrow" which could allow me to deal with my problem of Long Caption resulted in the following:

Index of /texlive/Contents/live/texmf-dist/doc/latex/floatrow

However, I am unable to open frsample04 to frsample12 as well as pictures.tex

The error message is that the  file picture cannot be found.

Am I in need of a particular package to open the picture files. I tried to open them with GSView but it does not work.

Tks for your help.
