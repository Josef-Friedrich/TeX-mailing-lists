Please,

is it possible to persuade xdvi to display the current page.  My
invocation line is:

	xdvi -unique myfile

but, if I call it again with the same file the display jumps back to
page 1.

I need xdvi to display the current page I am working on.

Thanks

which editor are you using?

I use emacs with auctex. I open xdvi from emacs via C-c C-v, and if I 
also use source-specials than xdvi can be started such that the same 
xdvi is used throught out and it is even go to the page corresponding to 
the source.

I simply leave xdvi running all the time : then whenever I update the .dvi 
file, xdvi catches up with the changes, while still showing the same page.

Please,

I am using texlive 2008, trying to \includegraphics lots of musical snippets.

Essentially my code consists of;

fig 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..... 15 clearpage

This is working ok, but latex seems to always print the figures in exactly
that sequence.

I was hoping that it might do things like:

fig 3, 1, 5, 4, 13, ......

so as to maximise the use of paper.

Perhaps I am misunderstanding, or doing something else wrong.

Can latex look on up its queque of floats and decide "ah, I can fit
number 12 in here" ?

LaTeX puts each float type in order, for a reader, if would be odd to 
find figure 5 right after figure 12.

I don't think this is possible, at least not without major rewriting of
the float code. One of the basic functionalities of latex floats is that
they appear in the order they were declared.

Seems to me that you could use your powerful visual brain to do this
by hand at the end to create a final version.  I would put the figure
calls one per line and then look at the results.  Then I would swap
lines to move figures to fit the pages.

A couple automation tricks could make this quick.  First, I work in
vim so switching two lines of text is merely the three letters 'ddp'. 
('dd' deletes a line, stores it in the buffer, p puts it in the
current location from the buffer.) By moving around first one could
quickly arrange things: 'dd2jp' to move a figure 3 down and 'dd4kp' to
move 3 up.

The other thing is to stay inside the editor and keep one's fingers on
the keyboard without using your mouse.  I invented the atchange
program for that (map ',' to do a ':w[return]' and
http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/atchange.html to trigger the latex
run displayed with xdvi) but I'm sure there are environments that
would work took.

Finally, it may be possible to use something like a poster envirnoment
to watch all of the pages in a tiny format simultaneously.  Then you
would easily see which chunk to move around.

I suppose that if you know the sizes of the bits and the sizes of
pages, you could write some smart code to look for solutions, but I
suspect that since there are n! solutions the problem is exponential
in n (ie NP-complete if I understand the notation).

Neither of those, I now remember.  I was in a picture environment, drawing a 
map, and wanted to put symbols centred on specified coordinates, so usually 
needed a shift leftwards and downwards from the default position.

BTW apologies for abortive message sent to the list by mistake just now.

Message-ID: <4960FF66.3010403@kalinowski.com.br>

    I was retypesetting a document from a couple years ago, but I've
come across a problem.

    The document uses the New Century Schoolbook font. In one or two
places, however, I need the \textcurrency symbol which is made available
through the textcomp package. But I get an error, like the following
example shows:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{newcent}
\usepackage{textcomp}
\begin{document}
\textcurrency
\end{document}

What I get is

! Package textcomp Error: Symbol \textcurrency not provided by
(textcomp)                font family pnc in TS1 encoding.   
(textcomp)                Default family used instead.       

See the textcomp package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

l.8 \textcurrency

I understand the symbol is not available and the symbol from the default
font is used. I'm OK with that, the symbol does appear and looks good
enough. But is there a way to get rid of the error?

This is way off-topic, but just for general interest...

Not quite. NP stands for "non-deterministic polynomial", and is the
class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time on a
non-deterministic Turing machine. An equivalent, and more intuitive, way
of defining NP is as the class of problems for which it is easy to
verify a solution, but it places no constraints on how difficult it
might be to *find* a solution. I.e. if I claim to have a solution to the
problem, you can check whether my solution is correct in polynomial
time, but there's no limit on how long it might take me to find that
solution in the first place.

A good example is factoring (ignoring technicalities to do with NP being
a decision class). If I claim to have found the factors of a large
integer, it's very easy to check whether they're correct: just multiply
them together and see whether you get the original integer back. But
it's an altogether different problem if I give you a large integer and
ask you to find its factors. (If you find a polynomial-time algorithm
for this, you'll be able to break all of the common public-key crypto
systems, such as the one used to encrypt credit card details when
shopping on the web.)

The class of problems which require exponential time to solve is called
EXP, whereas the class of problems which require polynomial time is
called P. It is not known whether P=NP, or NP=EXP, or neither. (Proving
any of these will win you a million dollar prize. What is known is that
P!=EXP.)

An NP-hard problem is a problem which at least as hard as any problem in
NP; solving an NP-hard problem would allow you to solve *every* NP
problem. Finally, an NP-complete problem is a problem that is NP-hard
and is also itself in NP. The canonical example of an NP-complete
problem is the famous 3SAT problem.


Just because there are many possible answers to search through doesn't
necessarily mean that a problem is hard. There are many examples of
problems for which the naive approach of checking every possibility
would take exponential time, but where there's a cleverer way of finding
the solution that only takes polynomial time (e.g. TeX's line-breaking
algorithm). However, the original problem of finding the optimal
arrangement of figures to minimize the number of pages is exactly the
bin packing problem (at least in the case of there being no text, only
figures). And the bin packing problem is known to be NP-hard. So, after
all that, you were right all along :)

Not that this means one should completely give up on solving it. There
are algorithms that produce good solutions to the bin packing problem,
even if not necessarily the optimal one. Implementing them would
probably require a major rewrite of TeX's page-breaking and
float-positioning algorithms, however.

Hope that clears things up somewhat,

Toby

Odd, I don't exactly see that : if I write

> 
> \bye

I see two hrules, not four.  One just above
the "a", one below.  These are fatter than normal
hrules, so I suspect I am seeing two near
co-incident pairs,  but I can't prove this
visually.  If I type

then I see one big fat hrule, clearly fatter than
I see after

hence supporting the "near co-incident pairs" hypothesis.

Anyhow, I think the simple answer to your question
is that the \hrules have zero width in the absence
of something to trigger TeX into typesetting one
or more line boxes.  Test this using

> \hrule width 6 pc

Yes, this worked, however, as you indicated, there is no vertical
space between them which results in a visually thick hrule.  I ended
up doing something like:

\hbox to \hsize{\vbox{\hrule width \hsize}}

This seems to place the hrule correctly and repeated use of it
produces lines that are spaced with the baseline appropriately.

Not sure if there is a better way to do this...

As Lars hinted subtly, it would be possible to create multiple 
float types for parallel streams of floating items.  The number is
limited, but I think up to 25 types can be accommodated, and
two are typically already defined (figure and table).

When you don't specify width, \hrule results in a rule as wide as an
enclosing box.  The enclosing box in this case is the \vbox
constructed by the output routine.  And the width of that \vbox is
zero because there is "nothing" on the page (that is, nothing that
contributes to page width).

Adding a single character to the page causes TeX to create a paragraph
consisting of a single line, or \hbox, the width of which is \hsize.
Hence the top-level \vbox's width becomes \hsize, and the \hrules now
fill the width of that \vbox.

Hope this makes sense,
Oleg

Yes, it makes sense now, and in fact, I could achieve similar results using:

\hrule \hfil

I notice that in the fonts directory there are seemingly dozens of
fonts available for use (other than cmr) but attempts to use them
result in failure:

! Font \myfont=lmr10 not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not found.

Yet, under /usr/local/share/texmf-dist/fonts there appear to be dozens
of them.  Including lmr:

/usr/local/share/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/lm

Is there something I must do to use these?

Yes, anything that creates a paragraph will work, e.g.:

    \hrule
    \leavevmode

You need to specify TFM files, that is, files with the tfm extension.
I think you've specified lmr10.pfb.  On my system, I have these:

    cork-lmr10.tfm
    cs-lmr10.tfm
    ec-lmr10.tfm
    el-lmr10.tfm
    l7x-lmr10.tfm
    qx-lmr10.tfm
    rm-lmr10.tfm
    t5-lmr10.tfm
    texnansi-lmr10.tfm
    ts1-lmr10.tfm

The prefixes are font encodings.  You probably need ec-lmr10 (note
that you'll need to adjust accent commands if you use them, because
accents in T1 are in different positions than in the standard OT1
encoding) and maybe some symbols from ts1-lmr10.  To see what symbols
are available, run

    tex testfont

and follow the instructions.

Yes, these now work as expected.  Is it possible to specify an
alternate path to read fonts from?  For example, if I don't have
access to the distribution directory and have a new font that I want
to add?

You can put things in user texmf tree.  Its location depends on the
distro you use.  On Debian TeX-Live, I believe it is in ~/texmf.
After installing anything in ~/texmf, you'll need to run

    texhash ~/texmf

or similar.

How do I determine what that might be?  Is this something that
kpsepath can determine, or is it build specific?  I suppose I could
ktrace the programs to see what they attempt to open.

Bingo! So it looks like its ~/texmf on my system as well.

I'm now immersing myself in fontinst.dvi, fontname.dvi et al to figure
out how to get additional fonts installed in ~/texmf.

I've been using the wrapfig package, by Donald Arseneau, for quite  
some time:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/wrapfig/

Chances are you already have it. Instructions are in the .sty file  
itself and in the multiple-span.txt file.

Axel

Subject: [texhax] \hline in align environment
Message-ID: <49618CEF.4000307@onu.edu>

When discussing elimination of variables in simultaneous equations, it 
is usual to have a horzontal line after the two equations which are 
being added and subtracted. This appears to be difficult to do in 
amsmath align environment. There was a question about this about three 
years ago, but there were no satisfactory answers usign align, as far as 
I can gather. Here is my solution.

\begin{align*}
       4x+  6y -2z &= -4\\
        x -y +2z   &=  9\\[-0.2in] 
\underline{\phantom{4x+6y-2z}}&\underline{\phantom{y}}\underline{\phantom{-4y}}\\
        5x + 5y    &= 5\\
         x + y &= 1
\end{align*}
I have used underline and for alignment, instead of using \phantom{=} it 
is necessary to use \phantom{y} otherwise the lines don't algin 
horizontally. Similarly the added y in -4y.

It is because of this alignment problem that the 2nd equation cannot be 
directly underlined, as the line from &\phantom{=} will be a little 
higher. I guess one might try &\underline{=\phantom{y}}, but I haven't 
tried this. If its works, it will be shorter.

I'll be interested in other solutions.

Hi:

   I posted yesterday to texhax my solution to the problem of drawing a
horizontal line at the bottom of two aligned simultaneous equations; I
had not been successful in finding any previous solution. It was this:

\begin{align*}
      4x+  6y -2z &= -4\\
       x -y +2z   &=  9\\[-0.2in]
    \underline{\phantom{4x+6y-2z}}&\underline{\phantom{y}}\underline{\phantom{-4y}}\\
       5x + 5y    &= 5\\
       \ x +\ y &= 1
\end{align*}

I appear to have solved this earlier by another, and I think, better
method.

I define a macro \und thus:
\def\und#1{\underline{\hbox to #1in{}}}

Here is an example using this:

\begin{align*}
  15x +3y &= 9\\
2x + 3y &= 8 \\[-0.18in]
\und{0.5}&\und{0.3}\\
17x \phantom{\ +0y}&=17\\
x&=1
\end{align*}
The vertical and horizontal spaces have to be determined experimentally.

Jan Tschichold (1902-1974) is considered by many to be the most
influential typographer of the twentieth century. A leading voice of the
modernist movement, Tschichold oversaw the redesign of the Penguin and
Pelican paperbacks in the late 1940s and devised for them a standardized
set of typographic rules. The classical type designs of his late career
qualify him as perhaps the first typographic postmodernist. Active
Literature, an in-depth study of Jan Tschichold's modernist period, is
based on extensive archival research that uncovered a wealth of new
photographs of his design work. Author Christopher Burke presents a full
portrait of the designer's career and puts into context Tschichold's own
account of his life and work.

Hi Ronald,
many thanks for the hint.  Obviously the bibliography provided by
en.wikipedia.org is incomplete.  There is an interesting book not
mentioned there (though de.wikipedia.org mentions it):

  Jan Tschichold, Erfreuliche Drucksachen durch gute Typographie,
  MaroVerlag, Augsburg 2001, ISBN 3-87512-413-8.

It's a reprint of a book Tschichold published in 1960.  I mention it
here because the reprint is still available in Germany.  You can buy
it in book stores or online.  This book is quite interesting because
though Tschichold favoured sans serif fonts a few decades earlier, he
radically combats them in this book.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks!  I'm sure your two suggestions will be useful to me.  I tried  
the following alternative which also worked.  What I found was the =  
in the RHS \phantom was not a problem, rather the absence of a y.  If  
there's something hanging down on the left, there needs to be  
something hanging down on the right.

\begin{align*}
  4x +6y -2z &= -4 \\
   x  -y +2z &= 9  \\[-12pt]
\underline{\phantom{4x+6y-2z}}&\underline{\phantom{= -4y}}\\
  5x + 5y    &= 5  \\
   x + y     &= 1
\end{align*}

I confess I'm unclear as to exactly what you
are trying to accomplish, but if it is similar
to what I think it is, then there is a far
simpler solution that requires no phantoms :
could you please take a look at --

and tell me if it is close to meeting your needs ?

Thanks. Your solution is exactly what is needed. I had tried multicolumn

to be slightly lifted I guess, but that is a detail.

Thank you for your suggestion. There are, in fact, only two columns, and
I was using three. It is interesting that all solutions that have been
suggested are not latex solutions, since \phantom, \multispan, \rlap etc
are used in tex, but not usually in latex. The closest I could come
toward a purely latex solution was this: 

\begin {align*}
      4x+  6y -2z &= -4\\
       x -y +2z   &=  9\\[-0.15in]
       \makebox[.8in]{\hrulefill}&\makebox[0.4in]{\hrulefill}\\
     5x + 5y    &= 5\\
        x + y &= 1
 \end {align*}

The disadvantage with this is that  one has to experimentally determine
the lengths.

I would be interested to hear your commentary on his opinions
against san serif.

Since he worked in a time when typography was moving 
off the page, from books onto very large posters,
I wonder what his issues were?

Today, we lean toward toward san serif because it reads good/well
on screen. Has that official opinion changed?

1. change each \epsfig{file=J01.eps,height=2in} to 
		\epsfig{file=J01,height=2in}

2. convert *.eps to *.pdf using to following command in bash

user#> for i in *.eps; do epspdf ${i}; done 

where user#> is the prompt.

3. pdflatex OpenAM.1.tex 

the outputfile is OpenAM.1.pdf

Hope this helps.

How about this?

\begin {align*}
       4x+  6y -2z &= -4\\
        x -y +2z   &=  9\\[-1.4 ex]

What office are you thinking of, if any ?  If I may try to start a discussion

because minimal.cls is truly minimal. article.cls sets \arrayrulewidth

I've found the solution: loading the textcomp package with the force and
almostfull options solves the problem:

\usepackage[force,almostfull]{textcomp}

Well, that's right.

Hear, Hear!

It might be noted that Tschichold moved away, in later life, from his 
passion for sans-serif and "came to the extraordinary conclusion that 
the `new typograpny', in ist insistence on certain styles of type and 
design, was inherently Fascist." (Sebastian Carter, Twentueth Century 
Type Designers, New York, 1987, p. 127.)  His final achievement, "his 
one significant typeface", (ibid.) was Sabon.

With modern screen resolutions, a decently restrained seriffed typeface 
will surpass any sans-serif for instant readability.  Bodoni-like 
extremes don't work, but perhaps they never did.

Message-ID: <1116.134.153.209.97.1231349332.squirrel@www.math.mun.ca>

Loadng the package "lscape", with
\usepackage{lscape}, and typing
\begin{landscape}
some  text in Unicode
\end{landscape}
does not place the text in landscape mode in that page.
Only the  page and the page numbering get placed in landsacape
and the actual Text is still in portrait mode.  I guess this has something
to do with'"odvips", since the same problem occurs with an ordinary English
text via  the route     lambda --> odvips --> ps2pdf.
Do I have to use any  flag with the "odvips" command to force landscape
mode? Any help in placing text in landscape mode for processing with
Omega/Lambda/Alpha will be appreciated.

That may not be entirely true.  In the 1970s--80s, Bob Morris of the 
University of Massachussetts did some studies of the innate filters that 
seem to favor certain patterns of linewidths and spacings at the 
early-vision level of sight, before interpretation begins (Chuck Bigelow 
illustrated the same phenomenon at the Stanford "farewell to lead type" 
conference in Stanford).  Morris's reliably quantifiable conclusions 
were associated with the widths of stems and interletter spacing, 
together with questions such as word length in various languages and 
interline leading, but he did mention that there seemed to be also an 
early-vision advantage to seriffed as opposed to sans-serif faces.  It 
was large enough to be noticeable, though not on the same level as the 
phenomena he was studying directly. 

A font in which | (one), | (lower-case l) and | (uppercase I) are 
basically indistinguishable unless you adopt the truly ugly forward hook 
on the lower-case l is hard to characterize as preferentially readable.  
I have been trapped by the similarity more than once, and have, on a 
very few occasions, had to resort to loading the offending text into 
OpenOffice and choosing a seriffed font.  I don't think that is solely 
because I am seeing with 75-year-old eyes.

I recently had to make much use of Syntax on a great number of 
illustrations for the University of California publication of Coarelli, 
/Rome/, and I came to appreciate the clean lines of this distant cousin 
of Optima when it is set against a background of random hairlines going 
every which way.  Syntax and Gill Sans are both triumphs of disciplined

He mentions the beauty and perfectness of classical (serif)
typefaces.  He also designed Sabon, as mentioned by Pierre already,
which is based on Claude Garamand's impressive work.

I think that he had been interested in the new typefaces bacause they
had been quite promising.  At this time (the Bauhaus period) there was
a tendency to simplify things.  He obviously recognized later that
simplifying typefaces doesn't improve legibility.

A typeface can either be an artwork, an object of utility, or both.

Classical typefaces are definitely both.  Many of the typefaces
designed at this time qualify as artwork, but they are unusable for
typesetting books.  However, since the purpose of a poster is to
attract attention, these fonts are quite useful there, even if they
are quite crazy and illegible.

 > on screen. Has that official opinion changed?

Actually, most people think that sans serif fonts are more legible on
screen because they are simpler.  But why?  What is the difference
between stuff printed on paper and stuff printed to screen?  Why are
serifs useful in books but not on screen?  If the only concern is that
resolutions are different, avoid Computer Modern.  CM fonts had not
been designed with low-resolution output devices in mind.  But there
are beautiful fonts available, carefully designed for low-resolution
displays.

The best example I'm aware of is:

Well, your original assertion was

and so I was assuming the computer screen as the universe
of discourse.  That being the case, I would not want to read
anything like one volume of Gibbons on-screen, in any font
whatsoever.

If, on the other hand, you want to broaden the Univ. to "any medium",
then I would undoubtedly prefer to read long runs of text
/on paper/ in "a decently restrained serif typeface" rather
than attempt the same in a sans-serif font, but I didn't think
that was the point under discussion.

dear list,

I'm about to finish a report and I want to change the positon of the 
chapter-headlines.
the default is a large gap between the page and the headline while I want 
the headline to start without this gap.
It shouldn't be that complicated but I couldn't find anything useful by a 
google-search.

secondly I want to suppress a pagenumer on the first page of each chapter.

any advice would be great,

Dear All,

I used to get few updates to TeX/LaTeX by ftping to the server labrea.stanford.edu.

I am trying to access labrea.stanford.edu nowadays and I get messages that such host is unknown.

Do you know to where the contents of labrea.stanford.edu moved to or would know who could provide me such information?

Thank you,

Hi Uwe,
isn't there a macro package available which allows you to determine
how chapter headings are typeset?  At our local TeX meeting someone
had a very similar problem recently.  Hence I think it's an FAQ.  I'm
not familiar with all the LaTeX macro packages available, but I'm
using TeX for almost two decades now and it's no problem for me to
re-define the chapter code.  I solved the problem exactly the same way
you solved Christian's problem.

However, I hope that a macro package is available which allows people
to determine the layout of chapter headings conveniently and we simply
missed it.  If such a thing doesn't exist already, isn't a LaTeX guru
out there who has the skill necessary to provide such a package?

Changing the layout of chapter headings is not trivial, but it's
definitely an FAQ.

I really hope that we are missing something.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <8f1b7b690901101859y38b294fidfbb019915f441cc@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to understand why my page numbering restarts at page 1 in
the middle of a section.  Here is an excerpt from the calling tex
file:

\newpage
\setlength{\baselineskip}{1.5\baselineskip}
\input 1_introduction
\vspace{0.25in}
\input 2_literature
\vspace{0.25in}
\input 3_events
\vspace{0.25in}
\input 4_data_methodology
\vspace{0.25in}

where the restart occurs in the middle of input 3_events.tex right
after a very long footnote:

\textsc{Event 1:} The trouble and bailout of IKB Deutsche
Industriebank (Friday, July 27, 2007 thru Friday, August 3, 2007.)  In
what would be the first bank to nearly fail and require government
support, IKB, a small to medium size German commercial lender
acknowledged large losses from subprime investments in both direct
exposure and off balance sheet conduit funds it ran on Monday, July 30
only 10 days after claiming to have minimal exposure to U.S. Subprime
assets during an earnings call.  The size of the total exposure was
nearly \euro 20 Billion and its support exceeded the capacity of its
primary investor, publicly owned bank KfW requiring a rescue package
of government, private and public banks.  The transmission of this
information to the market as reported in the financial press was noisy
making for a difficult event window definition.  As initially reported
on July 31st, IKB would receive support from publicly owned bank KfW.
Yet on August 2nd and August 3rd details on the mechanics of the
rescue revealed a call placed on Friday, July 27th, by Josef Ackerman,
the CEO of Deutsche Bank, to the primary regulator Jochen Sanio, who
in turn contacted the Finance Minister, Peer Steinbruck, and in what
would foreshadow numerous similar crises in the U.S. a weekend of
meetings saw a rescue package composed for IKB that included support
from the government, public and private banks in the sum of \euro 3.5
Billion.  In confirmation of the delayed market response to the
events, IKB's stock fell further on August 2nd (28\%) than it had on
July 30th (19\%).%
%
\footnote{\citeasnoun{WSJ073107} note the 19\% decline in stock price
on July 30th, the unquantified subprime exposure to an off-balance
sheet vehicle called Rhineland Funding, the bailout by KfW, IKB's
largest state-owned shareholder, and KfW's 80\% ownership stake by the
German government.  It also noted that just 10 days earlier IKB had
played down its exposure during an earnings call.
\citeasnoun{FT073107} reports KfW's stake in IKB at 38\% and quotes
IKB as acknowledging that it's creditworthiness had been questioned at
the end of the prior week and indicates neither IKB nor KfW would
quantify IKB's exposure or loss to subprime markets.
\citeasnoun{Blmbg080207} and \citeasnoun{FT080207} report on August
2nd that KfW had assumed \euro 8.1 Billion in obligations to IKB's
Rhineland funding unit as announced on July 31st.  Further, this was
the first mention of government involvement orchestrated by the
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck (also chairman of KfW's
administrative board) the prior Sunday (July 29th) and the creation of
a rescue fund of \euro 3.5 Billion composed of KfW (70\%), Private
Banks Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank (15\%), and Public banks (15\%).
\citeasnoun{FT080307} on August 3rd reported the involvement of
Deutsche Bank's CEO Joseph Ackerman the prior Friday (July 27th) in
alerting the government regarding IKB's funding difficulties and the
large decline in IKB's stock price on August 2nd of 28\%.
\citeasnoun{FT080907} reports on August 9th that IKB revealed on
Tuesday (August 7th) that another group of banks is supplying \euro
6.5 Billion in liquidity lines to its Rhineland Funding vehicle
besides the \euro 8.1 Billion provided by KfW.  He also reports that
IKB said it had \euro 7 Billion of its own assets (at the bank level)
invested in credit portfolios the preceding March outside of its
Rhineland Funding unit with 2/3 of that in US Assets.  Including
another off balance sheet unit, Rhinebridge Funding, that it would
need to bring on balance sheet produced a direct exposure to US Assets
of \euro 6.4 Billion excluding Rhineland's \euro 14 Billion in assets.
 \citeasnoun{WSJ081007} on August 10th provide details behind the
funding problems experienced by IKB the week before its rescue.  Its
Rhineland funding unit which borrowed principally through commercial
paper to support its \euro 14 Billion in assets found itself unable to
roll over the positions and on Friday, July 27th turned to IKB to draw
on a credit line.  IKB, in turn, had a credit line with Deutsche bank
which Deutsche refused to honor.  It was at the end of this day that

Hi,

I am trying to correct the following bibtex entry from running off the
side of the page:

@MISC{BOARD081707,
AUTHOR = {{Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System}},
TITLE = {Press {R}elease},
HOWPUBLISHED={\url{http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20070817a.htm}},
YEAR = 2007,
MONTH = {August 17,}
}

as it lists directly after another similar author entry, the author is
simply "-" and it attempts to put the url on the same line and it runs
off the side.  Is there any way to instruct that the url appear on a
new line or is this something handled by the style file?

Thanks,

Tom

To be more clear, I mean off the side of the references page output.

"same way" does not apply, the TOC design does not reflect the design of the first page of a chapter. 

You can

 \renewcommand*\l at chapter[2]{%
  \ifnum \c at tocdepth >\m at ne
    \addpenalty{-\@highpenalty}%
    \vskip 1.0em \@plus\p@ % PLAY WITH THIS
    \setlength\@tempdima{1.5em}%
    \begingroup
      \parindent \z@ \rightskip \@pnumwidth
      \parfillskip -\@pnumwidth
      \leavevmode \bfseries
      \advance\leftskip\@tempdima
      \hskip -\leftskip
      #1\nobreak\hfil \nobreak\hb at xt@\@pnumwidth{\hss #2}\par
      \penalty\@highpenalty
    \endgroup
  \fi}

in order to change the TOC design of chapter entries. 

Uwe.

I have referred to memoir.cls and nccsect.sty for similar purposes, 
but I don't know by heart what they offer for chapters. 
(You know, \@startsection is used for sections only ...)
For that specific posting, I could not imagine a less costing answer 
than referring directly to the standard code. 
For more general things about chapters, I once payed much "Lehrgeld" ...

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

You need to be a bit more specific in your choice of words.

I think you refer to the titles given to \tableofcontents etc., i.e. the 
functionality typesetting \contentsname

You need to redefine \chapter* as well as \chapter, the unnumbered 
titles usually is typeset using the inner workings of \chapter*

This would be easy if you were using the memoir class or (I assume KOMA).

I would also assume titlesec or sectsty can do this as well.

Hi Thomas,

    @MISC{BOARD081707,
    AUTHOR = {{Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System}},
    TITLE = {Press {R}elease},
    HOWPUBLISHED={\url{http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20070817a.htm}},
    YEAR = 2007,
    MONTH = {August 17,}
    }

    as it lists directly after another similar author entry, the author is
    simply "-" 

I don't understand that part.  Perhaps it's somehow related to your
double braces in the AUTHOR field.

    and it attempts to put the url on the same line and it runs off the
    side.  Is there any way to instruct that the url appear on a new
    line or is this something handled by the style file?

You can insert a (La)TeX command in the field to force a line break
before, as in:
HOWPUBLISHED={\newline\url{http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20070817a.htm}},

Best,
karl

Hi Christian,

    I'm about to finish a report and I want to change the positon of the 
    chapter-headlines. 

You might try the titlesec package
(http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/titlesec/).  As an
example, here's what I did in one project:

\usepackage[rm,medium,compact,raggedright]{titlesec}
\titlespacing*{\chapter}{0pt}{-2.5pc}{1pc}

Best,
Karl

Message-ID: <fa8771800901112136o56cf14e2k9ce0f989a87a90b5@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have the following two .tex files:

% ---- begin file 1 ----
The quick brown fox...
\bye
% ---- end file 1 ----

% ---- begin file 2 ----
\vbox to \vsize{The quick brown fox...}
\bye
% ---- end file 2 ----

The text of file 1 is shifted down on the page a few points, while the
text of file 2 is right up against the top of the page.
In other words, there is some space above the "T" in file 1, but none in file 2.

I don't understand why.
I have looked around the TeXbook and online, but haven't seen anything
obvious...

Can anyone explain this to me? I feel I am missing something fundamental.

Thanks
-John

You are using the term "headline" incorrectly.  I didn't realize
what you meant until seeing one of the answers.  That answer redefined
\@makechapterhead to use \@startsection.  Do the same with 
\@makeschapterhead (note the "s").

Thanks for the links, I hadn't seen them before.
In general, I understand the idea of boxes.
It seems to me that the only difference between my two examples is
that one starts out in 'vertical' mode and the other is in 'internal
vertical'.
But why the text would be positioned lower in vertical mode still eludes me...

It's the \topskip, see:

% ---- begin file 1 ----
\topskip 100pt
The quick brown fox...
\bye
% ---- end file 1 ----

% ---- begin file 2 ----
\topskip 100pt
\vbox to \vsize{The quick brown fox...}
\bye
% ---- end file 2 ----

\topskip is not active within \vboxes, only at the top of the page. And
it's not zero by default.

    You can put things in user texmf tree.  

Yes, aka TEXMFHOME.

    Its location depends on the
    distro you use.  On Debian TeX-Live, I believe it is in ~/texmf.

Yes, and that is the standard location for all Unixish systems, except
macosx which uses ~/Library/texmf.

    After installing anything in ~/texmf, you'll need to run
        texhash ~/texmf

For the record, unless you have many thousands of files in ~/texmf, it's
not necessary, or desirable, to run texhash on it.  It will work fine
without it and it's one less thing to (forget to) keep in sync.

Subject: [texhax] parenthesis problem in LaTeX
Message-ID: <200901140043.n0E0hgC0001485@strawberry.ncifcrf.gov>

Here's a puzzle for the sharp folks on this list!

\documentclass{article}
\newcommand{\theversion}{{version = 1.00 of latex2009jan13.tex 2009 Jan 13 }}
\begin{document}
\begin{center}
\textbf{A Bug in \LaTeX?}
\\
\theversion
\end{center}

\begin{equation}
H =
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \right)
+
P_{\mbox{silent}} \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{silent}}) \right)
\end{equation}

The outer pair of parenthesis on the left are made using
\verb|\left(|
and
\verb|\right)|, and indeed they show up as larger than the inner parenthesis.
However, on the right side of the equation, the same
pair of commands fails to give the same size parenthesis.

Ok, try go get around the bug by using big:

\begin{equation}
H =
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \right)
+
P_{\mbox{silent}} \times \big( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{silent}}) \big)
\end{equation}
That failed.

Try bigg:
\begin{equation}
H =
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \right)
+
P_{\mbox{silent}} \times \bigg( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{silent}}) \bigg)
\end{equation}
bigg is too big!

\begin{equation}
H =
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \bigg( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \bigg)
+
P_{\mbox{silent}} \times \bigg( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{silent}}) \bigg)
\end{equation}

Extra braces do not help:
\begin{equation}
H =
{P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \right)}
+
{P_{\mbox{silent}} \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{silent}}) \right)}
\end{equation}

Finally, make the equation parts exactly identical:
\begin{equation}
H =
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \right)
+
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \right)
\end{equation}
That worked.  So why would the height be different?  It's the `g'?

Try removing the g:
\begin{equation}
H =
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \right)
+
P_{\mbox{rinc}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{rinc}})   \right)
\end{equation}
Now they are the same, but of course it says the wrong thing.

So how should this be typeset?

Thanks for all of the suggestions from everyone to help with my
question.  I ended up not using the symbols, but I appreciate the
suggestions.

Just FYI (for others), I discovered the 'mathtools' package, which has
some cool capabilities when it comes to arrows (and I don't recall
mention of it in Glazer's book).

Thanks,

Tom,

You were the sharp one to diagnose the problem as the descending "g".
That was the hard bit. To fix, just add something that doesn't print but
takes up the same vertical dimension, namely a \vphantom{g}:

\begin{equation}
H =
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \right)
+
P_{\mbox{silent}} \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{silent\vphantom{g}}})
\right)
\end{equation}

This worked fine when I tested it.

I use phantoms all the time - be they \vphantoms, \hphantoms, or full
\phantoms.

Cheers
Steve

Thanks.  Unfortunately it took a while, but it was part of the
principle to boil the problem down so that others (or I!) could figure
it out!  Basically, http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/bugs.html  :-)

Excellent!

I was pretty sure there was a way to do it but haven't used phantoms
before.

I assume now that you meant to give up and use a letter instead of the
word.

As you can see, fortunately Steve knew a great solution that allowed
me to keep the spelled out words.  It's for a presentation and I want
to be absolutely clear.

Thanks for the effort.

Subject: [texhax] ispell
Message-ID: <000501c97606$b3c9adb0$80049643@sdaqmonckhl16t>

Hi,

I got caught having to use an older version of TeXLive on a MS-Windows XP
system.

TeXLive 2003. Everything works as it is suppose to
except ispell.

When I run ispell in the dos command windows on a TeX file it does work, but
I get all kinds of maybe
formating things that remind me of that thing in dos
for color ansis.sys or something like that.

When I run it in WinShell 2.2.1 it doesn't work or react
at all. It is like I didn't even run a file.

All the other stuff, dvipdfm, tex, and so on work.

I know that this is old old news, but I was wondering
if there is a quick fix.

I have been using TeX on Debian GNU/Linux and this
is my first real experience with it on Windows XP.

Thanks,

Hi Tom,
the problem is obviously that unlike "silent", the word "ring"
contains the letter "g" which has a descender, as Steve explained
already.

How can you achieve that all braces have the same size?  There are
many possible solutions.  You could use struts or phantoms.

However, there is a very elegant solution.  All *tex programs except
Knuth's tex itself are using the eTeX extensions for a couple of years
now.

You are using \left and \right already, but eTeX provides a new
primitive called \middle.  See:

section 3.9 on page 12.

actually the best solution might be \textrm not \mathrm, the index is a
word and should be typeset using the text font. Besides the \textrm 
supports accented letters whereas \mathrm does not.

In Danish the radius of a lake would be $R_{\textrm{s\o}}$

Does the same under Windows, so I think
Debian is in the clear (on this one, at least !).

Sorry, yes.  I didn't intend to imply the issue was distro-dependent;
I only mentioned Debian because there was a thread on their bug
tracking system describing something similar.

Ok, thanks.  I'm unsure how it would be used in this case.

\left( ..part A ring .. \right)
\middle??
\left( ..part B silent .. \right)

fails with '! Missing delimiter (. inserted).
<to be read again> 
                   ?
l.84 \middle?'

or

\begin{equation}
\left( ..part A ring .. \right)
\middle(silent right \middle)
\left( ..part B silent .. \right)
\end{equation}

gives 'extra middle('

\begin{equation}
\middle(
\left( ..part A ring .. \right)
\left( ..part B silent .. \right)
\middle)
\end{equation}

gives 'extra middle('

\middle(
\left( ..part A ring .. \right)
\left( ..part B silent .. \right)
\middle)

In the original context

\begin{equation}
H =
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \right)
+
P_{\mbox{rinc}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{rinc}})   \right)
\end{equation}

doing this:

\begin{equation}
\middle(
H =
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \right)
+
P_{\mbox{rinc}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{rinc}})   \right)
\middle)
\end{equation}

Also gives the error message 'extra middle('.

Even trying to follow their exact words,

\begin{equation}
\middle(
H =
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \right)
\middle)
+
\middle(
P_{\mbox{rinc}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{rinc}})   \right)
\middle)
\end{equation}

gives the same error.

I have no idea how to use this thing.

I think Reinhard meant

\left( ... part A ring ... \middle)
\middle( ... part B silent ... \right)

This will make all the brackets of the same height. However, from what I 
remember (and I may be wrong here), \middle does not change the spacing at 
all, so you may need to add spaces before \middle) and after 
\middle(.

pretty forward

\begin{equation}
H =
P_{\mbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{ring}})   \middle)
+
P_{\mbox{rinc}}   \times \middle( -\log_2 ( P_{\mbox{rinc}})   \right)
\end{equation}

Yup, that worked!!

An explicit example is always useful to have, it's one of the serious
problems with LaTeX that such working examples aren't always there so
one is left guessing.

Thanks!

Ok that worked:

$\left( \frac12 \middle | \frac 12 \right)$ % big bar in the middle

$\left( \frac12         | \frac 12 \right)$ % small bar in the middle

$\left( \frac12 \middle) \middle( \frac 12 \right)$ % )( in the middle

Hi Tom,
a simple example:

\begin{equation}
  \left( a+b \middle) \times \middle( \frac{a}{b} \right)
\end{equation}

As always: Whenever you've found out how things work, then you also
understand the manual. :)
But there is a hint in the manual though it can easily be overlooked:
\middle<delimiter>.  This explains the error message you got 
(! Missing delimiter).

BTW, here is a single-line example file for plain TeX:

$$ \left( a+b \middle) \times \middle( a \over b \right) $$ \bye

Please note that it doesn't work with tex.  You have to use etex,
pdftex, pdfetex, ... instead.  I didn't try, but I'm very sure that
you can use \middle in Context, eplain, texinfo,... too.  In short: It
works on any machine which prints "entering extended mode" to screen.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Yes, I see how that works now.

Of course the trouble with a vague message like that doesn't say what
to do ...  In this case the message was 
  fails with '! Missing delimiter (. inserted).
which is quite confusing because the '(' and the ')' could be read as
part of the message or as the symbols to be inserted.  But it looks like
maybe one needs a period somehow ...

My LaTeX is telling me it is "entering extended mode".

Dear Group, I had Latex on my older computer -- worked well.  After retiring, now I have bought a new computer with Widows vista and a HP 64 bit computer.  I am having endless difficulties making latex to work after loading a discs I bought a few years ago (Tex live 6, August 2001, Sabastian Rahtz), Lehman Dante Tex software three discs of 11/2001, down loads of GS863w64.exc, and Gs view 4.9.

Can anybody help giving me tips as to how I can make this work?  If I need to buy any new discs, I will be happy to.

I believe you'll have the best luck using miktex:

or proTeXt:

Oh gurus and TeX-meisters ...

In a horizontal alignment, if (for a given column) no row contains
an entry solely for that column, but instead invariably coalesces
that column either to the left, or to the right, or both, using
\span, how does TeX compute the width of that column.  And, if in
a similar alignment, there are a number of such columns that
abut each other, how does TeX distribute the space amongst them ?

This all comes from trying to typeset family trees, which problem
is driving me quietly insane :-(

It looks like your tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb file has been corrupted or
truncated somehow.  I believe that error message is reporting the entire
line as it was found, and it should not just be "longd".  (Clearly the
start of "longdesc", one of the directives.)

The best recovery would be if you have a recent copy of the
texlive.tlpdb file you can just put into place.  Let me know if you need
to pursue some other way ...

This situation does lead to surprising behavior that looks
buggy at first.  TeX gives the smallest feasible width to 
that unconstrained column, and that width is likely 
*negative*.  If you give a blank row somewhere with all
independent columns so as to enforce a minimum zero width
per column, then the resulting layout will look a lot more
sensible.

You may get columns that have no unique identity, and they
will be dropped -- combined with an adjacent column.

Subject: [texhax] usage of LIG/> in virtual fonts
Message-ID: <497C7CCB.3060806@avyaajamu.net>

I am new to this group. I need clarity on the semantics of '>' in the
LIGTABLE of virtual fonts. I could not find a clear explanation in any
document so far. I am trying to render some Asian fonts using this feature,
but I am stuck here. The documents says "the > signs
specify passing over the result without further ligature processing". 
I assume that the ligature replacements are made while processing a 
character
sequence from left to right. And this is done repeatedly until there are
no replacements to be made. Is this correct? 
If so, can someone explain  with an example how exactly this is done?
many thanks for any help,
Murthy

Hi-
I am using MikTex 2.7 and i need the command line arguements for converting

Anyway i use TexMaker as the editing machine and there is an automatic
option for converting latex2html but that doesnt seem to work. In case any
ideas regarding this would be helpful

Hi Paul,
   Perhaps someone more knowledgeable about fonts can give you a better
description, but `typewriter typeface' is fixed width; I often use it when
including programming code.

HTH,
Bob

hello, paul,

    What does the text in {\tt } look like? Is it fixed width? The 
    definition just says "typewriter typeface".

yes, {\tt } is a fixed-width font, typically used
for things like typing instructions or url's or
file names.

    BTW, the reason I'm asking the list is because I'm blind and the end 
    result of a latex compilation i.e. dvi or pdf isn't very accessible. 
    So I can't get the information via my screen reader.

can you tell us, please, what kinds of documentation
would you find helpful?  quite a few readers of this
list are responsible for documentation, and maybe we
(and others in turn) can benefit from your point of view.

thanks, I dare to represent the TeX users' community by declaring
requests on accessibility of TeX for the blind to be very welcome.

>What does the text in {\tt } look like? Is it fixed width? The

\tt generates fixed width, as you guessed.

For additional explanations of "typewriter typeface", it may be
useful to know about "antiqua" and "grotesque" kinds of typefaces.
The "Computer Modern Roman" fonts standard for TeX belong to the
"Antiqua" type, \sf generates a font of type "Grotesque".
"Antiqua" has serifs, "Grotesque" does not.
Moreover, the thickness of lines clearly varies in "Antiqua",
upright lines are thick, horizontal lines are rather thin.
Serifs are horizontal and thin (in \sf/"sans serif" this is
less clear to see).

Comparing the English and the German Wikipedia,
it appears to me that the English version interpretes "Antiqua"
too narrowly, in my view e.g. "Times" is a kind of "Antiqua".

"Typewriter typeface" has serifs like "Antiqua",
but all the lines have the same thickness.
The letters thus look like being composed just of vertical and horizontal
strokes and of half circles, all of the same lengths (apart from `v' and `w').
By contrast, displays of simple computer text editors use typefaces
with only few serifs, only to achieve fixed width without "horizontal wholes",
these are "filled" by the few serifs.

However, all this are just my impressions, I haven't attended
any courses to learn these things properly.

Now for the *practical* point of view. To best of my knowledge,
\tt is useful for nothing than for referring to "code", one kind of 
applications
is documentation of software, another is typesetting URLs.
Its existence in TeX stems from the fact that the TeX program
and its macros from its beginning onwards were used for typesetting
their own documentations. But this means that \tt is useful only for
a few inline words or for short "quotations" from software code
(or for code listings). There is a different application for
"typewriter typeface" I have been interested in:

I find it silly or somewhat too bold to send letters that are typeset like 
books
(while I still want to use TeX for typesetting letters). Also, the typefaces
of those "letters" nowadays typeset in "Times" etc. may be difficult to
read for many people even not outright blind, they are too small and narrow.
Moreover, if you typeset a letter on the typical paper (DIN A4 or letter 
paper),
the lines are much longer than in books, thus they tend to contain too many
characters than would be appropriate from a typographic view or for
readability. Therefore, official letters from public offices in Germany
quite often have used a "typewriter typeface" although typeset by computer.
For this purpose however, hyphenation is very important
(especially since German words are so long ...). \tt doesn't allow 
hyphenation.
- I wrote this assuming you considered *using* \tt,
and this may be a difficult matter.

Hope this helps,

     Uwe.

Many thanks for your observations, Donald.  I take it
that a column width can become negative (in the
scenario that we are discussing) only if the overall
width of the alignment is constrained (is this the
case ?).

In fact, my problem was needing a maximum width rather
than a minimum one; very briefly, I was attempting
to align three types of row : one containing a name,
with optional additional data; one containing a solidus;
and one containing an "=" sign, preceded by a date and
followed by a name.  My idea was to place the solidus
in a single column, cause the "=" to span three columns
(the middle one being the solidus column), and cause
the name in row one to span columns 1 and 2, 4 and 5
(this is, of course, a simplification, but you will
get the idea).  The problem was that the name spanning
columns 1 and 2 caused column 2 to grow in width, whereas
I had (very naively) thought that column 2 would take
the width of half an "=" minus the width of an "|",
leaving column 1 to grow as necessary in order to
accommodate the name.

Unless I am missing something very obvious, it does
seem to me that \haligns could be considerably more
powerful  if one could place constraints on column
widths (and, in particular, if one could specify the
maximum width for a column).  I'm now investigating
dynamic preambles to see if I can apply the constraints
that way.

> you could post or send an example to clarify.

Well, the code on which I was working I now understand,
and I have come to realise that the author's expression
of the family tree left quite a lot to be desired, so
I am trying to reformulate her tree layout first,  and
then will have another go at implementing it through TeX.

We had this earlier, then concerning LaTeX tabular environments.
With usual simple preambles, cells are considered \hboxes,
so a maximum width would mean something may stick out.
If you want to break lines within cells, you need preambles like
\vbox\bgroup\hsize<max-width>#\egroup.

The LaTeX tabularx package offers some "dynamic" control of
the \hsizes (maybe I then forgot to mention this), but problems
remain: if there is little horizontal space,
horizontal spacing within cells may look awful.
Once I did "manual" line breaking, then measure the longest
line in each column ... but formerly I proposed (I hope)
to treat cells as one-column \haligns, using \cr for manual line breaking
within cells.

For a real "maximum width" feature, doing line breaking within cells
automatically and using *less* than "maximum width" if possible,
I first would like to know an algorithm, i.e. a more specific specification
of the "maximum width" feature. Personally, I prefer doing the manual
way before I analyse which algorithm I am following when I choose
certain manual line breaks. However, I think my goal usually is
minimizing the height of the table, cf. TeXbook pp. 386ff. for balancing
just two columns. Enjoy! :-)

Cheers,

     Uwe.

After \hsize, I put a meta-variable "max-width" enclosed in 
less-than/greater-than symbols,
but Eudora seems to have misinterpreted this as something concerning the 
web, so gobbling it.

Hello Barbara
Thanks for the explanation.

My favourite LaTeX documentation would contain more words describing 
the physical effect of the commands in specific packages. I 
appreciate that LaTeX is mainly concerned with the logical layout of 
the document, hence its appeal to a lot of blind people, however, for 
those of us who want to do more than typesetting articles it would be 
amply useful to have a visual perspective of the end result in PDF or 
DVI, the rationale being that we can then decide when and where to 
introduce that \tt, mbox or ... command.
This is a much more pressing problem with other more visual subsets 
of LaTeX such as the XY package. Currently, there is no accessible 
tool for producing mathematical drawings except XY. The only obstacle 
to it becoming the de facto typsetting tool for blind people is the 
lack of comprehensible tutorials with text that is independent of the 
visual illustrations.
I hope that gives you a clearer idea of the situation.
Please let me know if I can contribute towards the creation of more 
blind accessible documentation.
Cheers
Paul

Interesting discussion.  Two notes:

1. Often documentation assumes that the reader already knows what the
package is for or does.  So one has to try the package to see if it
does what one is trying to do.  This can take a lot of time to no
avail.  This dovetails with Paul's comment.  Having explicit
descriptions of what each package is about (and what its effects are)
up front would really help make LaTeX much more useful.  Also, it
could reduce traffic on this group if it were well organized.

2. I've used pstricks to make drawings, that might be of some use to
you.

No, the width can be negative in natural-width \halign if 
a column has no singleton cells, but cannot be merged 
with another column due to overlapping spans.

So this is a different matter, and it sounds like there are
individual entries in each column.

> Unless I am missing something very obvious, 

This case *is* covered explicitly in The TeXbook.  In my
old copy it is a paragraph on page 245: "...sometimes they
produce undesirable effects... all the excess width is
allocated to the third [final] column."  Knuth recommends
\hidewidth to help, but it isn't terribly useful.
An old standby automatic solution is a finite shrinkable 
\tabskip, if you are using {tabular*} ot \halign to{} 
to force a specific overall width.

> seem to me that \haligns could be considerably more
> powerful 

They are very primitive.  Browsers render html tables much
more powerfully.  In TeX, further features must be built 
with tricky macros.  See tabularx/tabulary packages for 
LaTeX.

Uwe, I don't think it's silly to write letters which are as beautiful
as carefully typeset books.  The typographic rules are the same.

Of course, A4 and letter sheets are much larger than books and
probably require a different page layout (larger margins).

Times New Roman had been designed in 1931 by Stanley Morison.  The
sole purpose of this design was to solve problems with very narrow
columns in newspapers.  If you are using this font for anything else,
don't wonder that the result is not good. 

There are plenty of fonts which are more appropriate than Times.  Try
Garamond or Palatino, they both are quite comprehensible.  Much more
comprehensible than Times and much more appropriate for letters.  And
typewriter fonts are good for nothing else than to typeset computer
code.

Of course, if the software they are using still depends on MS-DOG...
This sounds strange but I had been quite surprized when someone who is
deeply involved in these things told me recently that one of the
biggest companies in Germany is still using emTeX on OS/2.

Forget about typewriter fonts and 'Times' in letters.  If the addressee
doesn't know you personally, your letter is all he has in order to
form an opinion about you.  Good typography is a must.  *Especially*
in this case.

There is also a variable width typewriter font in Computer Modern.
Try this:

  \font\vtt=cmvtt10
  \tt  hello\par
  \vtt hello
  \bye

It's not useful for typesetting computer code but it's definitely
useful for typesetting URLs.

Does cmvtt allows hyphenation?  I didn't try.

However, your proposal to use typewwriter fonts is fine for letters to
the fiscal authorities, though.  And don't hesitate to use Times or
even more ugly fonts in this particular case.  Futura is a good
choice, too...

Regards,
  Reinhard

PS: Can anybody explain this?

  \font\vtt=cmvtt10
  \tt  hello me\par
  \vtt hello me
  \bye

The 'm' is wrong in both cases.  Compare "l" with "m".

Ah yes, but in the case I was considering, I knew the
maximum width of a single-cell entry for the column,
but wanted its adjacent (preceding) column to expand
when the two were merged through the medium of a \span,
in order to accommodate the widest entry for the spanned
pair of columns.  As I am writing, I am beginning to
wonder if one possible solution would be to eschew \spans,
and instead to (somehow) cause the earlier column to \rlap
by the maximum width of the later column into the latter ...

I am in complete agreement with reinhard, both about the needless use of 
typewriter fonts and about the avoidance of Times Roman in places where 
it doesn't belong.  (A very minor point, though---what Stanley Morison 
released to the world in the 1930s was Times Roman.  Times New Roman is 
a relatively recent update.)

But I am puzzled by the statement that it is impossible to hyphenate 
typewriter fonts.  Here is what I get in plain TeX.

*\tentt
 
*\showthe\font
 > \tentt .
<recently read> \font
                      
*\showhyphens{hyphenation}
 
Underfull \hbox (badness 10000) detected at line 0
[] \tenrm hy-phen-ation
 
*\showthe\font
 > \tentt .
<recently read> \font

which woud seem to indicate that \tentt has no trouble with hyphenation. 

I could turn it off by setting the \hyphenchar for \tentt to -1, or I 
could set \lefthyphenmin to 10000 in any \tt environment, but the 
default appears to be to permit hyphenation in a \tentt environment. 

That said, by all means follow Reinhard's advice and use Charter, or 
Palatino, or Computer Modern for letters rather than typewriter font.  
If you really need a monospaced font, dear old Courier is still a 
reliable resource.

I suspect that the apparent failure
to hyphenate is actually the result
of trying to typeset using a monospaced
font within a justified regime.  If
\raggedright were used in conjunction with
\tt, I suspect that all would be well.

The HTML version of my "LaTeX for Complete Novices" tutorial uses 
bitmaps to show the example output but where the alt tag isn't 
sufficient to describe the output, the bitmap is linked to a page with a 
more in depth description (e.g. both bitmaps in 
http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/latex/novices/itemize.html). Is this 
the kind of thing that you're thinking about? Any comments to help 
improve the accessibility would be very welcome.

No, columns 2 & 4 have no individual entries;
they are coalesced with 1 & 3, and 3 & 5,
respectively.  But we should not waste too much
time here : your original explanation was
very helpful, and led me to add sufficient
visual debugging to see clearly where I was
going wrong.

Yes, I read that; "undesirable" is an understatement !

Interesting idea, and not one that I had considered,
although I played with \tabskip for a bit; however,
the \halign has no preferred size, so it probably
won't help here.

Just for the benefit of anyone else following this
thread, my idea yesterday "to (somehow) cause the
earlier column to \rlap by the maximum width of the
later column into the latter ..." turned out to
be quite simple : the preamble now reads --

> #&\hbox spread -0,5 \equalswidth {#\hss}&#&\hbox spread -0,5 \equalswidth {\hss#}&#\cr

Just for this TeXnical point:

Your \showhyphens resulted in `\tenrm...' Plain TeX \showhyphens switches 
to \tenrm
(TeXbook p. 364), LaTeX \showhyphens to \normalfont. To see hyphenation 
under \tt,
\showhyphens{\tt hyphenation} (no hyphens). \tt \showthe\hyphenchar\font: -1.

I didn't learn this by frightening experience, but I read (in the TeXbook? 
where?) that this is a feature of cmtt, the rationale being that it is made 
"for nothing else than to typeset computer
code" (Reinhard). It is not a general problem with typewriter typefaces. 
For my letter class, I just switch to the appropriate positive 
\hyphenchar\font. -- And when I made it, just wanted to have something 
simple, at that time this was very important for me. And I wanted that it 
looks simple. If I think about what the reader will think about me, I still 
prefer something looking simple. (May change depending on situation.)

Cheers,

     Uwe L.

Message-ID: <200901281942.n0SJg7Bi004476@strawberry.ncifcrf.gov>

TeXHaXers:

I finally got around to installing MacTeX from the September 2008 DVD.
I decided to try MacTeX instead of TeX Live since the documentation
says that all of TeX Live is in MacTeX.  Why not see what the
interface is like?  The installation went smoothly, and MacTeX runs
nicely.  Congratulations.

I usually use LaTeX from the command line (or scripts) so I tested
that and found one small discrepancy.

%  which latex
/usr/bin/latex

Then:

% cd /usr/bin
% ls -l latex
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  45 Mar 22  2006 latex@ -> /usr/local/texlive/2005/bin/i386-darwin/latex

That is, the pointer in /usr/bin was not updated, so I was still using
the old latex installation.  I did that by hand using ln and sudo:

lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  50 Jan 28 14:26 latex@ -> /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/universal-darwin/latex

If it is possible, I would suggest making this modification to the
installation script.  Actually, I changed the name to latex2005 just
so I could get back to it.  An option to delete the previous
installation probably would be useful too.

Tom

Subject: [texhax] BachoTeX 2009 -- Call for Papers
Message-ID: <4980D7BB.4030402@uni.torun.pl>

Dear TeXies, TeX friends and lovers of fine typography --

This is an invitation to BachoTeX 2009, the XVIIth Polish TeX Users
Group Conference.

As usual, it will be held at the traditional TeXies' and GUST meeting
place, Bachotek near Brodnica, in the north-east of Poland, from
April 29 until May 3, 2009 inclusive.

We are again trying to get a glimpse of the future, whence the
conference title:

    "TeX: at a turning point, or at the crossroads?"

The community is putting a lot of effort and thought into possible
strategies for promoting and developing TeX and related products for
the foreseeable future, including :

* TeX, and TeX-based engines
* enhanced graphics engines
* new or improved macro packages
* user interfaces
* new fonts

Work progresses in many different directions, and thus there is
clearly hope for an ever better future, even though the more
pessimistic may wonder whether TeX represents an evolutionary dead-end.

In this context the feedback between users and developers of new
tools and engines is immensely important -- it might decide whether
within a few years we will be looking back at today as a successful
turning point or as a bad decision at the crossroads of TeX's history.

Some say that they have never believed that conference themes/mottos
have any impact on submissions anyway. We, the Program Committee,
think otherwise; please help us to prove our point !  Although we do
not restrict what your presentations should be about, we would be
more than happy if your contribution will be user-centric and
oriented towards the future of TeX with special emphasis on the
needs, hopes and dangers.

Proposals (abstracts) should be e-mailed to the Program Committee,
which listens at the address of papers-2009 at gust dot org dot pl.
Bogus\l{}aw Jackowski is the appointed chairman. Also, please note
the ``Call for TeX Pearls'' below.

Especially welcome are proposals for TeX-related tutorials or
introductions. If you have suggestions for tutorials or workshops by
others than yourself or about specific topics, please let us know.

The deadline for abstracts and other proposals is the March 8th.  The
deadline for final papers will soon be published at the conference
web site:

    http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2009


                         Recovery from stress

Exhausted TeXies will get a chance to recover their intellectual
powers during nightly musical sessions, usually at a bonfire.
Participate by bringing your own instruments (and voices) ! Nature
fans will have the opportunity to enjoy the unspoiled features of the
Bachotek lake and surrounding woods :

site is an enclosed area with a safe and attractive playing
ground for children and parents alike :

Please make the most of the opportunity !


                           Call for TeX Pearls

We are continuing the tradition of "The Pearls of TeX Programming".
Here, briefly, is what is wanted:

   * short TeX, MF or MP macro(s)
   * results must be useful, and the solution not obvious
   * easy to explain :  10 minutes at most

If you have something that fits the bill, please consider submitting
a proposal. If you know of somebody's work that does the same, please
let us know, and we will contact that person.  Other details and
previously collected Pearls can be found at

         Paul:
Here's an extract on unordered lists taken from Nicola's page:

Lstart extract
Each \item  command has produced a bullet point offset from the left 
margin. The text following the \item  command is set in a block 
following on from the bullet point. There is a blank line before and 
after each item in the list.
end extract

That's "essentially" the sort of thing we need in the documentation. 
I would add details of indentations -- are the bullet points or the 
text items indented in relation to the normal paragraph? What happens 
to alignment if the text of an item requires two or more lines?
I wonder if a good description of plain Tex commands would add 
efficiency to the solution under discussion.

Any thoughts?

Cheers
Paul

I'm CCing your entire message below to Richard Koch, MacTeX  
maintainer, who can provide a much better answer to you.

The thing, in short, is this ---MacTeX provides a mechanism ---due to  
Gerben Wierda and Jerome Laurens--- through which you can shift from  
one TeX distribution to another you have installed; see

/Library/TeX/Distributions/TeXDist-description.rtf

The user interface of this mechanism is a control panel in System  
Preferences, called ``TeX Distribution'' (you should have it). I don't  
think, though, that TeX Distribution knows about TeXLive 2005.

TeXLive usually asks you if you want symlinks of the *binaries* in / 
usr/bin (or is it /usr/local/bin?); MacTeX, on the other hand, makes a  
symlink to the *active distribution* in /usr/texbin ---that's how it  
allows you to change from one distribution to another.

Obviously you had installed TeXLive 2005 from TUG before, and /usr/bin  
is taken precedence over /usr/texbin.

Best,

Axel

Thanks for your comments. I'm not sure when I'll get the time to update 
it, but when I do I'll add more detail to the descriptions. I also need 
to update all the other tutorials on my website to improve their 
accessibility.

In answer to your question about the itemize environment, the block of 
text following \item is offset by \leftmargin (25pt for article.cls) 
from the left edge of where a normal paragraph would be aligned and the 
label (in this case a bullet point) would be placed at \labelsep (5pt 
for article.cls) to the left of the start of the text, where the start 
of the text is indented by \itemindent (usually 0pt). (So the start of 
the text is indented by \leftmargin+\itemindent, and the following lines 
are indented by \leftmargin.) I'll have to work on a clearer way of 
describing that.

Hello,

spurred on by a discussion on a german TeX users' mailing list, I dared an
attempt at translating the french comments in boites.sty to english.
My last contact with the french language has been more than 15 years ago,
so I would appreciate if anyone with knowledge of this language could have
a look at those translations. All lines I added start with '%%SD'.

I already contacted Vincent Zoonekynd, and hope that -- if my translations
find approval -- those translations find their way to CTAN eventually.

Thanks for your help,

	Susan Dittmar

RTF = really terrible format??!!

There is a nice warning in that file about it being rather technical. 
I don't see that I should need to know about all these details when
installing.

Yes, I have that and it only shows me TeXLive-2008.

As a naive user, I wouldn't know about this or even want to know about
it.  I did find the /usr/texbin link.

That's right.  

It seems to me that the program could be aware of the previous
installations and "do the right thing" or ask the user what to do to
upgrade.

I know I knew how to do this once upon a time, but that knowledge has
disappeared into the mists of time :-(

In plain TeX I want to do the following:
  if there is X amount of remaining space on the current page:
    do A
  else
    do B

Can anyone suggest anything? I don't remember it as being difficult, but
nothing I've tried this afternoon has quite done the job properly.

Hi folks
1. What is the general significance of the asterisk "*" in LaTeX and 
in particular, the xy package? I see it used in (0, 0))*{}, **\dir or 
**\crv{}. Is it more than syntax sugar?
2. What about the "@" symbol?
I've no problem memorising the commands though it'd be helpful to 
know what each part means.
Thanks in advance for your help.

You want to look up \pagegoal and \pagetotal.

I did the following in a package years ago and it works ok, but the TeX
page-breaking algorithm means there is some fuzziness about what the
bottom of the page actually means and the last time I suggested
something like this, others here didn't think much of it.  You are
warned, but it works for me.

I would be gratefull if anybody could help me with my problem.

I am using the colortbl package in order to add colors to the table of my
book. Despite the fact that when I produce the dvi file everything looks
fine
when I convert it to pdf most of the hline of the tabular enviroment do not
appear right. I am using miktex 2.7 and winedt. Does anybody know how I can
resolve
it?

Thanks

how do you convert to pdf?
and could you provide a minimal example?

and besides, that was not a minimal example, by definition a minimal 
example is a small complete document that can be copied to a file and 
compiled without any changes.

well there are at least two ways of getting from dvi to pdf, so we might 
need to know what exactly that button does (dvipdfm(x) or dvips + ps2pdf)

If B = "start new page and A", then you can do something like plain
TeX's \beginsection:

\outer\def\beginsection#1\par{\vskip\z@ plus.3\vsize\penalty-250
  \vskip\z@ plus-.3\vsize\bigskip\vskip\parskip
  ...
}

I'm glad we have the same philosophy for packages, though I've never
gotten around to making such a tight package for my own programs!

My first installation seems to have been from fink, so maybe that's
where the link came from.

I have tried both ways as well as a third one the pdflatex. I tried it not
only through winedt but also through command line. The best result was
through dvips+ps2pdf where the hlines appear but not on all the tables.

Are we sure this isn't just a problem of resolution?  That is, are we just
looking at the screen version or comparing printed versions?

Cheers,  Phil

Sorry, if this is a repeat but something funny happened to my computer
earlier just as I was posting.

Anyway, my question is if this isn't just a problem of screen resolution.
That is, does the problem persist in the printed versions?

Cheers,  Phil

P.S.  I get LaTeX errors with the "minimal example" provided - it doesn't
klike the \arrayrulecolor[cmyk]{1 0 0 0} command.

Dear Madam/Sir
 
I have only a little question concerning the package ?supertabular?:
Is there a command to determine that there are, on every page, four more lines in the table.
 
I can solve this problem with a negative value of the command ?\shrinkheight?. But with this command, I can solve this problem only local. How can I do this global, with one command so that it will appear on every page?
 
Thanks a lot and best regards
Gust Eilinger
 
 
PS: I have been looking in google and in several forums for more than four hours but I haven't succeeded ... I also have read the documentation about the supertabular-package. But I wasn't lucky ...

People might find Dick's article about this interesting and/or amusing:
