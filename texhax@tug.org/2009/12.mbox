Request for clarification: is this something you would do one time, with one
envelope? Or are you looking for a procedure for bulk mailing (that is,
you'll be sending many envelopes, each having a different address)? In
either case, I'm not convinced LaTeX is the appropriate solution. It might
be easier/more efficient to use an awk or perl script to generate the ps
files to be printed on the envelope, but of course LaTeX will also do the
job. The only thing to do is choose your paper size appropriately (based on
the envelope size) and place the address correctly on the page. Other people
certainly have more experience with the latter task than do I.

Cheers,
Bob Wilson

It's just a one-time thing. I wanted to print the address on the envelope to make it look more professional, but I don' think I can put an envelope in the printer. I think writing the address by hand is the simplest solution for a one time thing.

Thanks for the answers,

Hi Sally,

If it is a one time thing... don't bother with it much
If you like to have it "pro"
take one of those address stickers (normally they come in a set aranged on a 
sheet, cut one out and leave some boarder space), 
Print the address (created by LaTeX or anything else) on a regular paper 
sheet,
Place the single sticker above the printed address on the sheet (without 
removing the rear-side film) and tape the boarders of the rear-side film with 
some scotch tape to the paper sheet (without taping the sticker itself),
Put the paper again in the printer (carefully check for the right side) and 
reprint,
Remove the sticker from the rear-side film, 
Place it on the envelope,
Enjoy and have a coffee.

That method will work fastetst for a single print.
Don't need to bother around with right margin settings, etc.

Well it depends on the printer. Quite a lot have a manual feed slot
for unusual papers and you can use it for envelopes. But the
envelopes shouldn't be to small, they can get "lost" or slip around
in the printer.

On the whole I think it is easier (and even more professional
looking) if you use envolopes with a window and put the address on
the letter.

If you make the conversion to PDF, and have a good printer interface for 
the PDF, it is pretty easy.  (CUPS does it just fine.)

I assume you have sliding guides in the MANUAL slot for the printer.

Set up a second page for the address, and make a couple of runs to get 
the addressing parts for the envelope down toward the middle of the 
page.  The final position will seem a bit counterintuitive on most 
printers, but once you have done it it is a model for the future.

Waste an envelope or so (use really cheap thin ones) seeing whether you 
have the following correct.

Portrait or Landscape

Paper size for the printer.  If you get this right, the image on the 
print menu will show it right.

Auto Rotate and Scale for the printer.  (This is the real trick)



Now print it on a test envelope. On most desktop printers, the envelope 
goes in printable side up with the flap to the right,
but you can find that out by inserting a blank sheet of paper, with a 
mark on one side so that you really know which side was printed.

Adjust the position of the address text as needed.  One or two 
adjustments whould do.

Once it works, save the address sheet details as part of a letter.sty 
(or whatever LaTeX calls it) file.

You can do really elegant things with the return address that way.  I 
use Goudy Hand-Tooled for one return address, because it is relevant to 
the typesetting I do at that address.  (But it is wise not to get too 
inventive.)

sorry if someone mentioned this :

Avery (or other brand) has labels on 8.5X11 inch paper - you print on the 
*labels*, then peel off and stick on the envelope.  very handy.

Hi,

I've been using the package makeindex to create an index for a book and I would like to use "see also".  For example, something like:  path, 76, see also curve.  I found a macro for this, but I couldn't get it to work properly.

Thanks!

The *package* is makeidx (7 characters); the *program* or application LaTeX calls is 
makeindex (9 characters). The package makeidx already has the macro for see also, the command |seealso (with |, not \). So in your preamble put

\usepackage{makeidx}
\makeindex

and where the word ``path'' appears use

...path\index{path}

and almost at the end of your text, when no more \index calls are made, you can put all you seealso commands:

\index{path|seealso{curve}}%

Best,

Axel

I regret my oversimplification ---it isn't LaTeX that calls the makeindex program, but your LaTeX editor when you ask it to run Makeindex.

Subject: [texhax] Job postings: Development of typesetting system for
	scholarly texts
Message-ID: <302238700912022333x4f8383b8qa577142bdf2d2b06@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) funds a joint project of the
University of Applied Sciences Worms (Germany) and the University
Trier (Germany) for the development of a typesetting module for
(primarily) scholarly texts.

We will jointly develop a typesetting system for XML-based texts with
complex layout requirements that meets the stringent requirements for
the typesetting of (potentially heavily multilingual) academic texts
(e.g. critical editions). The end user will work directly with
semantically annotated data, without having to use explicit layouting
instructions. In this the system will build on the TeX experience (not
code!) and apply it to new requirements.

Based on a WYSIWYG user interface (to be integrated into the TextGrid
Lab, cf. http://www.textgrid.de) the system will support end users in
the development of style-sheets for the rule-based formatting of their
texts and will master the production of PDF (including PDF-A for
longterm archiving).

For this work we look for two motivated research assistants with a
strong skill set in software architecture and development, one
primarily focussing on the design and development of the core
typesetting system itself (based in Worms) and one primarily looking
at the end user interface (based in Trier). Applications should be in
by December 31st.

You can find the full details of the call under
http://www.budabe.eu/print_stellenausschreibung.pdf (in German) and
http://www.budabe.de/print_stellenausschreibung_en.pdf (in English)

We are looking forward to your applications!

Best regards,

Marc K?ster

P. S.: Please feel free to forward this application to any interested
party

P. P. S.: I realize that this topic is slightly off-topic for the
texhax list, but expect that it might nevertheless be of interest for
TeX-users

Among these articles are ones that describe tools and techniques
that can be used in teaching.

The PracTeX Journal 2010-1 issue has the theme "LaTeX Academic Work Bench".

The goal of this issue is to present ideas on the use of LaTeX tools
for education, teaching, and classroom purposes.  We are looking for
articles that can discuss the development of the tools, and their use and
effectiveness.  Actual examples and LaTeX sources are encouraged.


** Scope
The scope of the issue includes, but is not limited to :
- tools that assist the students/authors in preparing
   graphics, indexes, bibliographies, and other parts of documents;
- text manipulation tools;
- tutorials;
- short videos;
- free or almost free tools;
- teaching texts;
- homework styles;
- cross-platform tools.

We encourage you to submit original papers describing your experiences
using LaTeX and TeX tools in an academic setting, and also papers
on tool development work in progress or completed.

** Submission Guidelines:
If you would like to submit an article or technical note for
publication please contact the editors pracjourn at tug.org.
We will work with you to prepare the article.  Also see
http://tug.org/pracjourn/submit.html
for the Journal's guidelines.


** Important Dates:
Paper submission deadline:  December 31, 2009
Publication date: February 10, 2010

** News
Submissions in any language are acceptable.
Since its beginning in 2005, the PracTeX Journal has accepted

Message-ID: <311224200912060808kecf2924nd77673cc412f5221@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm close to the end of a long process of proofreading and making
corrections to may manuscript, and suddenly biblatex, which I use for my
references, prints references with crossrefs in the following way:

Bateson, Gregory. 'Cybernetic Explanation'. in: Steps to an Ecology of Mind.
2nd ed. University
of Chicago Press, 1972. pp. 405-16.

The 'in:' should be capitalized here (and was before, when I sent it off to
the proofreader a month ago). It's the same with 'internal' bibtex fields
such as 'translator':

Attali, Jacques. Noise: The Political Economy of Music. trans. by B. Massumi

After the full stop, clearly 'trans.' should be capitalized. I have no idea
how to resolve this or what I did to produce it. *Any* hints or suggestions
would be most welcome!

best,

/Henrik

Hi Henrik

First thing I would always try if something like this happens is to delete ALL 
temporary files. Sometimes for some reasons things went wrong and LaTeX will 
not update this files if there is no need e.g., no change of the source-files.
For a standard document only the .tex and .bib file are important. Make  sure 
you keep the figures if you store them in the same directory and if you use an 
own stylefile for bibtex you have to save this as well (.bst).
Some TeX-editors can delete all temp-files for you. I do not know what kind of 
editor you use.

If this doesn't work you can check whether you still use the same bibtex style 
file. Within this file it the formating is defined. Maybe you can try to copy the 
bst file from your old machine to the other computer and make a diff.
You could also try to copy the bst-file from your old machine to your new 
computer within the folder of the tex file rename it into something else and 
call explicit this stylefile by
\bibliographystyle{mybibstyle} within the tex-file.

In addtion it is also worth to check the message output of latex and bibtex. 
Often warinings can be ignored but maybe in that case they give you some idea 
what is going wrong. If your editor does not allow to read the output of latex 
and bibtex try to call them from the command line.

Hope that helps a bit


Regards,

Torsten

Well obviously something changed. That can happen. But as you didn't
give any useful informations (versions of biblatex on both
computers, complete small example which demonstrates the problem and
would show what style and language you are using, log-file) it is
rather difficult to tell you more.

stupid... Thing is, I can't reproduce it with a small example so (I was
thinking) the most likely reason is something's gone wrong in my sources
(this is a 150 page manuscript). I was running biblatex 0.7 on both machines
and I couldn't see any errors in the pdflatex output and bibtex did not
complain.

Now, I've tried upgrading to biblatex 0.8 but I can't get that to work at
all (so now I can't get a maningful logfile from my own source). Trying to
run one of the biblatex examples (01--introduction.tex) results in:

! Undefined control sequence.
\biburlsetup ->\Urlmuskip
                          =0mu plus 2mu\relax \mathchardef \UrlBreakPenalty
...
l.40 \cite{companion}

Maybe a dependency problem?

Not sure if it's meaningful but the attached small example works (!) but a
similar citation command in my manuscript does not work correctly.

Thanks again for any suggestions,

/Henrik

check the style-file I'm using. I haven't done that. Unfortunately I've
already tried upgrading my biblatex and broke it altogether (see my other
reply in the thread). Right now I should either try to get biblatex 0.8 to
work or roll back to 0.7.

Make a copy of all your files in a new folder. Then move the
\printbibliography and the \cite command directly behind
\begin{document} and put a \end{document after \printbibliography.
Then compile. If the problem persists something in your preamble is
responsible. Start to remove things until you find the source of the
problem. 

If the problem disappear in the short document start to move the
\end{document} until you find the point where the problem start. 

Make sure to remove auxiliary files between the different tests and
to run the complete compilation circle (latex + bibtex etc).

Updating a large package like biblatex when you are approaching a
deadline and when you don't actually know that your problem will be
resolved by an update is asking for trouble. Are you sure that you
did install the new version correctly and that is now used? Did you
put all the file in the correct places and did you remove all files
from the older version?

\Urlmuskip is defined in url.sty which is loaded by biblatex. The
following works fine for me

\listfiles
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{biblatex}

\begin{document}
\the\Urlmuskip
\end{document}

with versions:

 article.cls    2007/10/19 v1.4h Standard LaTeX document class

Well working example are in general not really useful to find
problems in non-working documents.

Is there general command which discourages breaking inline math between lines?

I am definitely not interested in hacks like \hbox{} or \newline

What does "between lines" mean in this context ?  Can
you give an example of a maths source and the place(s)
at which you would prefer breaking not to occur ?

That sounds like a good method. I'll roll back to the previous version (0.7)
of biblatex and try to figure out what caused this error.

Well, it isn't a decision I'm very proud of; I was panicking...

Anyways, thanks for the useful input. When (if) I find what caused the

hmm, without a minimal example, i.e. a full minimal compilable document, 
that shows the error it is a bit hard to help

perhaps my crystal ball works today...
I guess the problem is the brackets ([..]) after a manual linebreak (\\)
They are interpreted as part of the linebreaking command, giving some (I
think additional) distance between lines. Try one of the following
workarounds

- use \\[0pt] instead of \\, giving the optional argument.
  I do not know if 0pt is the correct value though. But I am sure someone
  on this list can provide the correct value.

- use {[*]} instead of [*]. It does not change the output, but (La)TeX will
  know the angular brackets are not this optional argument to \\

- use \\ {} instead of \\
  This introduces an empty token and might -- I do not know (La)TeX's
  internalls well enough to know this -- introduce additional white space,
  but it might look better to human eyes in the source code.

Hope this helps,

	Susan

Help please,

On my Mac with OS Snow Leopard,  TimeMachine works nicely but 
I have found FEW of my .tex files are recorded, 
yet my .pdf,  .log, .idx, .aux and all other LaTeX files are recorded.

Is there any reason for TimeMachine to miss the essential .tex files ?
Can I change my use of TimeMachine to catch and hold every.tex file ?
Perhaps TimeMachine records only the files which are on the screen 
when TimeMachine looks for files to back up.

Thanks

work and processing my document with it rendered the correct bibliography.

Now the fact that the document worked on another machine under biblatex 0.7
and under my current machine with biblatex 0.8 makes me suspect it had
something to do with a corrupt style file as Torsten suggested. Well, I'm
not going to experiment more with it now that it works!

Subject: [texhax] epsilon problem
Message-ID: <200912090159.nB91xiIZ019371@strawberry.ncifcrf.gov>

Hi:

I have been using \epsilon in LaTeX (looks like a set membership)
but it turns into a backwards 3 when I switch to 

\usepackage{pslatex}

See:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon
(the 'lunate epsilon' is what I want but the 'open e epsilon'
is given by pslatex.)

Also:
http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=291211

Is there a way to use pslatex (since it displays much more cleanly)
but force the epsilon to be the original LaTeX form?  Something like:

\renewcommand{\epsilon}{ ...}

Thanks,

Tom

You can try this

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{pslatex}
\usepackage{txfonts}          % comment un-comment this
\renewcommand{\sfdefault}{phv}% 4 lines to see you get the
\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{ptm}% same text result with and w/o
\renewcommand{\ttdefault}{pcr}% them, but \epsilon is right

\begin{document}

abc {\sf abc} {\tt abc} \quad $\epsilon$ \quad $\varepsilon$

Message-ID: <311224200912091441w21e1cf45l283401d2cf013ea4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In a book project I'm using biblatex with the option 'indexing=cite' to
generate index entries for author and title for the works cited. However, I
would like to remove certain entries from the index. Although I can do this
manually (or by writing a simple script), by editing the .ind file (might
just be the simplest option) I can't help but thinking I should be able to
define an alternate citation command for entries that should appear in the
bibliography but not in the index.

The command \citeauthor is declared in biblatex.def as:

\DeclareCiteCommand{\citeauthor}
  {\boolfalse{citetracker}%
   \boolfalse{pagetracker}%
   \usebibmacro{prenote}}
  {\indexnames{labelname}%
   \printnames{labelname}}
  {\multicitedelim}
  {\usebibmacro{postnote}}

and redeclaring that without the \indexnames command successfully removes
the name of the work cited using \citeauthor. What I would like to be able
to do, however, is to define a command that is equal to \footcite but which
doesn't but the author and title fields in the index, but from looking at
biblatex.def I just can't figure out how to do it.

Any suggestions?

best,

/Henrik

Subject: [texhax] Fedora 12: cmr12 font shrunk?
Message-ID: <4B1F9C71.705@skwc.com>

I used LaTeX to write two books and am working on a third. I just 
upgraded to Fedora 12, and thought something looked really wrong with my 
draft printouts, which looked smaller. I couldn't belive my eyes and 
actually printed a page I'd already printed (back under F11) and 
compared them side by side. CMR12 has shrunk! I thought at first 
something had gone wrong in the printing, but there are no errors, and 
the scale factor is 100%. LaTeX is not substituting a smaller font, 
because the lines on the page are indentical and if a smaller font was 
being used, there would be more text per page.

Has CMR12 changed? If so, how do I get my old CMR12 back so all three 
books look the same? I'm baffled as to what to do about this. I'm not 
even sure where or how to ask about this.

Scott

Message-ID: <000001ca795b$e36bad30$aa430790$@net>

TUG Support,

 

I would first like to commend your team for providing a vast website of
resources for the Tex community.  

 

I recently downloaded the mla-paper package(Directory: CTAN home /
tex-archive/  macros/  latex/  contrib/  mla-paper)  in order to format my
latex document for MLA.  After package installation, the complier produced
several errors each involving \ifpdf, specifically: " ! undefined control
sequence \ifpdf ".  After opening mla.sty, I noticed mla.sty was missing
\usepackage{ifpdf} from the code, the reason for the output errors.  As a
side note, currently I am running TeXnicCenter and MiKTeX on windows.  If
this truly an error in the code, then this email is simply here to inform
the TUG team of it and have it corrected so other users do not have
complications.  However, this may not be an error in the code, but a
situational error for my Tex setup. Either way, my code is working and I
want everyone else's to work.

 

Thank you for your time,

 

Alex

*If* cmr12 had changed then you would get more text on a line as it
quite improbable that your class changed \linewidth at the same
time. 

You are not saying how you are compiling and printing but the most
probable cause of your problem is the setting "fit to page" in the
adobe reader printer dialog.

Hi Scott,

cmr12 hasn't changed.  Really.  Absolutely not.

I'm as sure as I can be that it is something in the printing mechanism.
I experienced many things myself (and long since gave up on using the
system spoolers).

Well, actually the above is a lie.  The metrics haven't changed and
never will, but in TeX Live 2009, cmr12.pfb was changed wrt hinting and
a few glyph shape changes from Knuth.  There was no shrinking, though.
(Also I doubt you are using TL 2009 since it was only released a few
weeks ago.)

Attached is one PDF made with the TL'09 cmr12.pfb and another with a
much older (web2c 7.4.5, some ancient tetex) cmr12.pfb.  Maybe it will
help you debug the printing problem which I am 99.99% sure is the
culprit :).

Best,
Karl

\noindent\begin{picture}(0,0)\put(0,0){\rule[\baselineskip-1in]{1in} 
{1in}}\end{picture}
\end{document}

Then pull it into a second .tex file, and the measured size varies  
according to whether or no it's been pulled into a \savebox?:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{calc,graphicx}
\usepackage{geometry}
\geometry{
paperwidth=3in,
paperheight=3in,
margin=0mm}
\begin{document}
\newsavebox{\scaledLogo}
\newlength{\LogoVSize}
\sbox{\scaledLogo}{\includegraphics{logo.pdf}}%
\settoheight{\LogoVSize}{\scaledLogo}%
\usebox{\scaledLogo}

\the\LogoVSize

\settoheight{\LogoVSize}{\includegraphics{logo.pdf}}

\the\LogoVSize

\includegraphics{logo.pdf}

\end{document}

For some reason \LogoVSize == 4.30554pt when measuring the \savebox,  
but 72.2698pt when measuring the graphic directly --- why is that?

Apologies if this is a silly question. I am making a header using the 
fancyhdr package, and I would like to automatically use the information 
from \title, \author and \date. The short title used by the table of 
contents would be especially helpful. But I haven't been able to figure 
out what the commands would be ... does anyone know?

\title{My test document}

It may depend on whether you are doing your own printing from a desktop
printer or using a commercial printer.  
If you are using a commercial printer, you need to take account of the
recently developed standards for PDF, such as PDF/X-3
(I have not yet explored PDF/X-5).  The Adobe Acrobat Pro distiller
seems at this time to be the only tool you can use to set the four
page-wide levels of boxing, of which you will need three.  They run
MediaBox, CropBox, BleedBox, and TrimBox, with the defaults being to
have the borders of all four the same.  If you use dvips with the -O
and the -T options, you will effectively be setting the MediaBox to
match the CropBox.  Then distiller will give you the (Advanced
Options) option to set the Bleed Box to the CropBox, and to specify the
offset of the TrimBox boundaries, which must lie inside the Bleed Box. 
(The amount favored by the presses I use is 9 Adobe points inside all
four boundaries of the Bleed box.  Unfortunately, Ghostscript seems to
be still at an experimental roll-your-own stage in offering these
details.

This means that your basic colored underlay must be 18 pt wider and 18
pt deeper than your desired trim size, and must be moved into position
so that it extends outside the trim size in all four directions.  I
find it best to size the color underlay as needed and then immediately
declare that it has 0pt width and 0pt depth, so that it will not
complicate the positioning of other elements on the page.  

Sorry if this sounds complicated.  It is complicated the first
time through, and you will probably spend some time looking at the PDFs
and fudging dimensions until things come right.  I use a framework of
\vrules that can be turned on and off with an \if \fi construction so
that I can really see where the TrimBox will be aligned.  (The rules
are set into named boxes, and the boxes are given  a declared 0pt width
so that they will not affect the spacing of other elements.  The effect
is a sort of visible \strut.)

If you can get hold of a PDF that has BleedBox and TrimBox set, look at
it in something like emacs, and you will get a good idea of how and
where the values are set in PDF/X-3.

Good luck.  It works very well once you get the hang of it.

Pierre MacKay

Because you are not measuring the height of the box
(\usebox{\scaledLogo}) but of the command \scaledLogo:

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
\newsavebox{\scaledLogo}
\newlength{\LogoVSize}
\sbox{\scaledLogo}{\rule{1in}{1in}}%

\scaledLogo, 
\settoheight{\LogoVSize}{\scaledLogo}%
\the\LogoVSize

\bigskip

\usebox{\scaledLogo}
\settoheight{\LogoVSize}{\usebox{\scaledLogo}}%
\the\LogoVSize

\end{document}

Subject: [texhax] More on Fedora 12/cmr12 font shrinking
Message-ID: <4B2282C1.5070607@skwc.com>

Thanks to the folks who have given me assistance on this baffling issue. 
I have ruled out that it is not a change in LaTeX itself, but have not 
found the cause of the shrunk font.

I upgraded to Fedora 12 last week, and printed a draft chapter of a book 
I was working on. I immediately noticed that the page had smaller print 
than the other draft chapters I had printed.

Because I had changed nothing in my print settings, I thought at first 
that the font cmr12 had changed. I couldn't find any explanation for 
what happened. Someone sent me an "old" LaTeX test page and a "new" one 
from the versions before and after the Fedora 12 upgrade, and both 
printed the same way. This has ruled out LaTeX itself as the source of 
the shrinking font.

I am using pdflatex to generate a PDF from my source files. I use Evince 
to print this file. I have written two fairly involved books this way, 
and this is the third. The only change in anything has been from Fedora 
11 to Fedora 12. I have not changed printers, the LaTeX source, etc.

I looked at the print settings in Evince's print dialog, the printer 
defaults, and the printer driver defaults. None of these have changed. 
They are set to American letter size paper, the correct orientation, 
etc. Plus they are set to the correct scale factor. There is not any 
"best fit" or "fit to page" setting active. If it was something as 
trivial as this, I'd have found it by now.

There are no errors in CUPS' error log to indicate anything at all. 
Whatever the Evince -> CUPS -> printer driver system is doing, it 
doesn't think anything has gone wrong.

I used the scale factor to scale the document to 105% and printed a test 
page. I held the new page up along with an old page to a strong light, 
and the individual letters are the same size, but the space between each 
letter and word, plus the space between lines, is not the same, so this 
can't be a scale issue.

I'm baffled by what has happened to cause the font to shrink. I know 
that what's printing out is not a 12-point font. Whatever is going on is 
below the level of user control, either deep inside CUPS, or in the 
latest version of the printer driver. I do not have the expertise with 
print systems to debug this sort of thing. Nor the time, because I have 
to finish this by the end of the year, so I don't have time to debug it. 
I mainly wanted all three books to have a uniform look on the printed page.

Scott

Dear Boumediene,

The quickest way for you to obtain the software would be to download it.
See: http://www.tug.org/texlive/

Is that possible for you?

Currently we have last year's version available on DVD. (We haven't 
received the 2009 DVD's yet.) So if we send a copy, it would be the 
2008 TeX Collection, fyi.

Sincerely,

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.00.0912111523060.32266@ewers.me.chalmers.se>

Hi,

I'm a sysadmin trying to solve some problems with a local texmf tree.

Please note that I'm a very inexperienced latex user, just a sysadmin trying
to solve a problem...

The problem was that the font map files were in the wrong (old) place,
and users were getting errors like these:

ewers:elijah:[~/docs/astolin_prob]$ dvips -d 4 KASHIWARA.dvi

So I read the faq and found this:

33) Font map files and enc files from my local texmf tree are not found
     by dvips / pdftex etc.

     With version 1.1 of the TeX Directory Structure, the location for
     these files was changed. These files are font files and are now
     stored in fonts/{map,enc}/<syntax>/<package>. So, the solution to
     your problem is to rearrange these files in your tree and then call
     the command texhash. More help is given in the release notes section
     of the teTeX manual (run the command "texdoc TETEXDOC" to read it)
     and on the web page http://www.tug.org/texlive/mapenc.html.

I found that there was four map files stored in the wrong place in our
/usr/local/share/texmf tree and I moved to what I believe is a correct
location:

ewers:elijah:[~/docs/astolin_prob/new_test]$ ls 
/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/
dvipdf  dvips  init  misc  pdftex
ewers:elijah:[~/docs/astolin_prob/new_test]$ ls 
/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/misc/
paz.map  psfonts.map  ptt.map
ewers:elijah:[~/docs/astolin_prob/new_test]$ ls 
/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/init/
mma.map
ewers:elijah:[~/docs/astolin_prob/new_test]$

If I just do that and then run texhash I get much less
errors, but there is still one fatal error left:

vcs32-5:elijah:[~/docs/astolin_prob/new_test]$ dvips -o KASHIWARA.ps 
KASHIWARA.dvi
This is dvips(k) 5.95a Copyright 2005 Radical Eye Software

Then if I copy the system updmap.cfg to my
working directory and add the following lines
to it:

# Chalmers
Map paz.map
Map psfonts.map
Map ptt.map
Map mma.map

Then I run the following command:

updmap --cnffile ./updmap.cfg

After that it will work perfectly for my account.

But of course I want it to work globally for everybody
using the local tree, so I tried this:

updmap-sys --cnffile updmap.cfg 
--dvipsoutputdir=/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/updmap 
--pdftexoutputdir=/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap

updmap: This is updmap, version 1107552857

CUPS will probably use Ghostscript to change the PDF to postscript if
you're using a PS printer.

Have you tried using dvips to produce a postscript version and then
examine it with gv or print a page? If your printer supports
postscript then that would avoid using Ghostscript (or Evince?) to do
the pdf->ps conversion.

Right, I'd start by using plain old latex and dvips to generate two different
PS files (one sample page).  If they are different I can help figure out why
from those files.

If that's too difficult, why not just put up two sample pages, one from 11
and one from 12, in PDF format somewhere, and we can take a look on
our systems.

If you print the -12 generated PDF using the -11 system, do you still
see the same problem?  How about the -11 generated PDF using the
-12 system?

What fonts and font types are used? (With adobe reader you can check
them in the properties dialog, pdflatex shows the fonts at the end
of the log-file).

You can do this:

\newcount\tempnumber
\newcommand\mycommand[1]{%
  \tempnumber=#1%
  \multiply\tempnumber by10
% Then somewhere in your code, for instance:
  \put(\tempnumber,5){...}%
  }

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0912122302230.26741@csopt4.wpi.edu>


Dear TeXers,

using margin par with the twoside argument in article class, I find they 
are only typeset on the right-hand side page, not on the left (odd 
numbered pages yes, even numbered - no).

Why?  The Latex Companion shows nothing useful; the FAQ says on page 
http://tinyurl.com/ycj9kd8 that you can use with the twoside argument the 
following format, \marginpar[left text]{right text}, but when I tried it 
the [left text] was inserted in the middle of the line!  Looking at my 
preamble suggests nothing sinister, other than it is too long.

Removing the twoside option resolves the problem.  For the current needs 
this will do, but I got to appreciate this layout device, and would like 
to use it more -- but almost all that I typeset needs the twoside option.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,                --Micha Hofri

Subject: [texhax] Migrating from Windows to Mac
Message-ID: <4B2541C7.3030807@psych.uib.no>

Gentlepersons:

I am in the process of migrating from Windows XP to a MacBook Pro (Snow 
Leopard), and have simply copied a number of files from the Windows XP 
machine to the Mac Via an external hard disk and a memory stick. I then 
find that files which compile (to PDF) perfectly OK on the Windows 
machine give me an error message on the very first line, the 
\documentclass one gives me an error message: undefined control 
sequence.  On the next line: \documentclass etc.

This is when using TeXworks on the Mac, and probably TeXLive.

This is probably a line endings problem.  There must be a program on
your system which converts the line endings, try fromdos, dos2unix,
flip, toix.

No, not as far as I know.  I installed the TexShop package, and that is 
supposed to include LaTex.

Dear All;

I hope you are all fine and doing well.

I am totally a new user of Latex and honsetly speaking I am in a rush to submit a journal paper as soon as possible.

I have problem getting Arabic text written in the ".tex" file displayed in the ".pdf" file. My Arabic text appears fine inside the ".tex" file since i set the I set the encoding into "UTF-8" format, but the moment I run the ".tex" file to produce the ".pdf" file the Arabic text is missing. Everything seems fine just that Arabic text will be missing from the ".pdf" file.

I really need assistance on this matter as soon as possible.

Thanks alot for your kind cooperation.

Yes, it is some conversion issue.  If I enter a trivial document using 
the keyboard, it compiles all right, but it does not work with files 
coming from the Windows machine.

TeXShop alone is a front end for a TeX Distribution (where the (La)TeX programs and other files reside) and from what you say it appears that you have a TeX distribution or the pdf(la)tex program wouldn't be found at all. I'm just wondering what distribution you have. Do you have a System Preference Pane called TeX Distribution? If so, what distribution does it ``say '' is active?

Howdy,

Do you have a %& line at the top of the file? If so, what is it?

What is the contents of the log file when you attempt to process that file?

What do you use for Arabi typesetting? Arabi, arabtex, polyglossia, bidi?
You would need to send a minimal tex file.

You can convert your files by opening a terminal in OSX and doing:

$ tr -d '\r' < inputfile > outputfile

which removes the return present at the end of each line in a Windows file.
(Windows has linefeed + return, unix has just linefeed).

I'm pretty sure OSX has tr.

If you want to convert a whole load of tex files:

$ cd <your tex files dir>
$ mkdir unix

$ for file in $(ls | grep 'tex');do
tr -d '\r' < $file > ./unix/$file
done

The fact that it includes latex doesn't mean that you actually used
it. 

You description sounds like this error message which is the typical
message you get when you call tex instead of (pdf)latex:

! Undefined control sequence.

Typesetting my annual Christmas letter, there are one or

TeX Live 2009 doesn't seem to have a "Smilies" font, so

Yes 'tr' is there on OS X, i've checked.  But when I tried the command 
in a terminal, I only got a feedback on usage for the command rather 
than a converted file.

It sounds to me as if you have set your word-processor input to accept 
UTF-8, but have not included any UTF-8 capabilities in your TeX or LaTeX 
package.  Do you even have a Unicode font(set)  suitable for DVI or 
PDFTeX output?

I use this script:
********************************************************************************
#!/bin/csh -f
#(ie run the cshell on this but don't read the .cshrc)

# nom: no ^M: remove control M's from a file!

#    version = 1.01 of nom 2009 nov 21
# 2009 nov 21, 1.01: avoid illegal byte sequence problem
# 2009 Jul 11 origin

# avoid Illegal byte problem on Macs:
setenv LC_ALL en_US.ISO8859-1

tr -d '^M' < $1 > $2

********************************************************************************

where the ^M is a control-M.  You will have to do this in vi or vim
by replacing the two characters with a control M.  One types:
/\^M[return]c2l[control-v][control-m]:wq
\r should work too though.

Note the setenv that makes tr on a Mac happy with unicode characters
that would otherwise crash it.  This should not be an issue for tex
files but can be for others.

Thank you for the information.  The command you recommended worked, or 
at least without yielding an error message.  However, I had the same 
error message as before:

This is pdfTex, Version 3 ...
entering extended mode
(.second.tex
! Undefined control sequence.
1.5 \documentclass
    [10pt,a4paper]{article}

So, assuming that your command worked, it cannot be the line endings.

the line endings probably needed to be

that you are using *plain* tex, not latex.
i can't tell you how to launch latex, but
there should be some documentation that
will point you in the right direction.

Could you try the same thing on a file containing just

	\relax
	\end

and see if the log file matches the following :

This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-1.40.10 (Web2C 2009)
**\relax
entering extended mode
LaTeX2e <2009/09/24>

where "LaTeX2e" is the all-important bit ?

Howdy,

It is clear that you are trying to process the file using pdftex rather than pdflatex! No... not because of the

This is pdfTex, Version 3 ...

line because you'd see that with pdflatex also but there are clearly no packages being loaded, etc.

Good Luck,

If it's a line-endings problem you shouldn't get an "undefined control
sequence" error message if the \documentclass command is the very first
thing LaTeX reads.

Please send us your .log file.

I can't believe that there is a line-endings problem.  It's the first
time I hear that pure ASCII files are not portable among different
ports of TeX.

  Reinhard

The error message says "This is pdfTex...." As mentioned by Ulrike
Fischer earlier in the thread, you are probably using Plain TeX option
in TeXShop to parse a LaTeX file. Have you tried changing the option
from Plain TeX to LaTeX in TeXShop and running the file?

I also feel that you are using Plain TeX because, on my OS X command
prompt if I do the following, I get the same error with pdftex, but
not with pdflatex (sentences starting with ** or * are those that I
typed on the prompts of pdftex/pdflatex):

Dear me.  Others have suggested that, but I had difficulties in 
believing that.  Why should one not want to use LaTeX?  I have made the 
assumption that when some Tex editor is downloaded (like TexShop), it 
would install Latex and use by default.  As a matter of course.  At 
least, that is the case for any of the Windows editors I have tried and 
used for several years, like WinEdt and TeXnicCenter.  Nevertheless it 
is obvious that you are right.

But at least I have come one step further.  I have tried TextMate, ands 
at least that one lets me beyond the first line.  Evidently it does not 
install packages on the fly, but at least that is one less serious 
problem than I have had with TexShop and the like.

Thanks for the assistance. Apart from having owned an Apple IIe in the 
early eighties, I am in my second week of learning how to use a Mac.  It 
is obvious that there is a lot to learn and unlearn.

Tom

Howdy,

I doubt it's a line ending problem. I taken files generated on a PC and even OLD files from my old TeXtures distribution on Mac OS 8--9, which used \r for newlines, and compiled them directly under Mac OS X which uses *nix line endings.

Good Luck,

You need to check what you have defined in the applications'  
preferences. TeXShop does tend to make use of PDFLaTeX by default, I  
think. I have no idea about TextMate.

There are a range of options available to you, whatever is your choice  
of operation. Those options are also available in WinEdt and  
TeXNicCenter, but likely in different places.

In TeXShop choose TeXShop > Preferences. In there, click on the  
Typesetting and Engine tabs to make certain you are using LaTeX and  
that your path is correctly defined.

That is what others have suggested as well.  Barbara Beeton suggested 
that I used TeX rather than LaTex, which is probably the case.  See my 
response to her.  In any case, it is getting quite late here in Norway 
and we are having guests as well, so I'll quit for tonight. Thank you 
all for useful suggestions.  I am in any case getting closer to what I 
want to achieve, establishing myself in a more stable and predictable 
world than Windows.  So thanks so far.

Howdy,

The default compile with TeXShop (and TeXworks too) is pdflatex so you may have something in your file that tells TeXShop to use something else, e.g.,

%& xxxxxx

tells TeXShop (and TeXworks too I believe) to execute the xxxxxx ``engine'' to compile the file. If the xxxxxx engine does not exits for that editor (TeXworks doesn't know about latex->dvips->ps2pdf processing by default, neither of them will understand something exotic that existed under MikTeX) I'm not sure what gets executed.

In TeXShop check TeXShop-Preferences->Typesetting; the Default Command should be LaTeX and the Default Script should be Pdftex.

By the way, I'd send you all of this off-list but my e-mails directly to you were bounced.

Good Luck,

Herb Schulz

Because every TeX incarnation has it's pros and cons.  Context is more
advanced then LaTeX.  Why should one want to use LaTeX, then?  Plain
TeX users often have to write code while LaTeX users just have to load
a package which already provides this code.  But plain TeX is much
faster than LaTeX.  This doesn't matter if you write a book.  But
railway companies generate customized time tables on-the-fly on their
web-sites using pdftex, banks in Germany are using TeX in order to
create statements of account (sometimes 400,000 per day), I got
telephone bills from the German Telekom created by pdftex...

In most cases LaTeX is a good choice.  But in general, if you ask what
is most appropriate, plain TeX, LaTeX, or Context, the definite answer
is "it depends".

Regards,
  Reinhard

According to update, well not really on the fly but also very convenient, check out the TeX Live Utility.

Message-ID: <0AD48529CDE34E5BA6615A81323CCD06@JohnNahay>

Dear TeX,

My Mathtype Version 6.0 with MS Word 2000 has become impossibly slow. It takes 5 minutes for a 5-page document to load with all the Mathtype images.

Fast easy typesetting is necessary for me to DO the math.
The formulae I manipulate are SO big that I have no way of organizing them practically on paper.

I have attached the conversion from Mathtype to TeX or LaTeX (I don't know which) 
which Mathtype allows me.

I use a home personal computer, VAIO Sony RZ56G, Windows XP Home Media Edition 2004.

I have no money to pay anyone to typeset for me, because no one has paid me for over 8 years for anything.
(There are no jobs anywhere.  I have been unemployed for 8 years.)

Please turn my attached file (which is a very incomplete version of my paper) into a document with 
the proper math symbols displayed.

Mathtype 6.0 and MS Word 2000 crash about every 7 minutes. That amounts to about 30 times a day for me.

I need to use a WYSIWYG typesetting program only.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Dr. John Nahay

My suggestion would be to try either LyX (What You See Is What You Mean)

http://www.lyx.org

  or TeXMacs (what you see is what you want).

http://www.texmacs.org/

Either of these should be better able to handle large equations and  
complex documents than Word (I wonder if you don't have some physical  
problem w/ your PC or other difficulty w/ your Windows installation  
--- that's an awful lot of crashing --- I'd suggest doing a hardware  
diagnostic to at least test your memory).

To typeset the file which you provided in LaTeX you simply need to add:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\begin{document}

to the beginning of the document (called the preamble)

and then close out the document w/:

\end{document}

You'll also need to indicate the ampersand in the title should appear  
as an ampersand --- set it as for instance:

Mishkov, Rumen L. Generalization of the Formula of Faa Di Bruno for a  
Composite Function with a Vector Argument Internat. \emph{J. Math. \&  
Math. Sci.} Vol 24, No. 7 (2000) 481-491.

Once you've made the above changes, the file you provided should  
import into LyX just fine, then you could continue editing in that.

Here's a tutorial which should be of help:

TeX (LaTeX, and just about any other form of TeX) is not a WYSIWYG 
system.  Decades ago, Blue Sky managed a quasi-WYSIWYG system that 
flipped back and forth between TeX operations and display, but that 
would not get you anything like the speed you ask for.  Further, TeX 
does all its calculations in long integers, for reasons that are 
explained in /TeX, the Program. /

If speed of calculation is your primary need, TeX is not for you. / /I 
doubt that even luatex would meet your criteria.  Massive mathematical 
calculations more or less have to be done in programs designed to get 
maximum efficiency in performing mathematical calculations.  That is not 
what typesetting is all about.

One issue. \[...\] is used to indicate display math, which I don't  
believe you'd want to use as much as you are.

Changing all (most?) of them to \(...\) will make the math in-line  
which is more like what you want I believe.

I just switched from windows to linux (ubuntu) and have installed texlive
2009.

I have a ~/texmf directory where I have put some bib and sty files.

I have a directory ~/book that contains master.tex. master.tex has things
like
\include{chapter1} \include{chaper2} etc. Now, chapter1.tex resides in
the directory ~/book/chapter1 along with perhaps included graphics files
and related R programs.

I would like to cd to book and have latex find the files in its subsidiary
directories.
I am not keen on moving book to be subsidiary to texmf because there is a
lot of non-tex stuff there.

I am overwhelmed with the Kpathsea documentation and the FAQs weren't
enough help either. Can someone give explicit direction on how to do this?
I would greatly appreciate it.

Sincerely,
David

I think that you should use relative paths when including files:

If your document are in ~/book/chapter1/, you may use
	\include{../chapter2/foobar.tex}
	\includegraphics{../images/foobar.jpg}
	\include{../chapter2/section/foobar.tex}

You needn't to use TDS with your non-tex files.

Layout:
~/book/
	master.tex
~/book/chapter1/
	chapter1.tex
	fig1-1.eps
	fig1-1.pdf
	...
~book/chapter2/
	chapter2.tex
	fig2-1.eps
	fig2-1.pdf
	...
...

Your master.tex file contains:

\include{chapter1/chapter1.tex}
\include{chapter2/chapter2.tex}

Go into directory and run
bash:[~/book]$ pdflatex master.tex
...

If you use bibtex/makeindex/... then run instead of pdflatex
bash:[~/book]$ latexmk -pdf master.tex

This should work.

Note: if you insert images into your document you should use relative
paths, e.g. in chapter1.tex:

\includegraphics{fig1-1} %%% without extension provided that there are
%%% fig1-1.eps _and_ fig1-1.pdf files

Subject: [texhax] Create standalone graphics using TikZ
Message-ID: <ed4892840912152348x6f2a1996qde75a81e28d2bed6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am learning TikZ language and will mainly use it in latex documents.
 But I still think about a question:  Beside of creating graphics for
latex documents, can I also use TikZ to create standalone graphics in
other format, e.g, eps, so that I can use the graphics in documents
with other formats?

Thanks a lot.

Hi,

I am reading the TikZ manual in PDF format.  I feel the format and
graphics in the document is so much beautiful so I desire to check out
its latex source.  Is it public accessible and how can I get it?

Thanks in advance.

If you're using TeXLive 2009, it's here:

/usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf-dist/doc/generic/pgf

The chapters are in the subdirectory ``text-en''.

As for your previous question,

> Beside of creating graphics for latex documents, can I also use TikZ to create standalone graphics in other format, e.g, eps, so that I can use the graphics in documents with other formats?


Yes to both ---see the chapter ``Externalization Library'', where it says ``The purpose of this library is to provide a way to export any TikZ-picture to separate pdf (or eps) images...''.

There is a very helpful pgf/TikZ mailing list:

https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pgf-users

See the archives ---a question like yours has just been answered there.

Best,

Axel

Thanks. Also, your graphic display of my layout is much better than my
description.

Another question: In c/c++ and html, if you have a path in an include
statement
the path is relative to the current file. In LaTeX the path is relative to
the master file.
Are these correct observations?

Thanks. But did you every try to build the pdf from the sources? There
is a Makefile under the directory and when I run 'make' in it,  I got
an error:  "can not open pgfmanual.tex", but the file does exist in
the directory.  I then checked the Makefile, there is a TEXTINPUTS
definition, but I did not see any problem. It's strange ...

I guess you have to copy the whole pgf directory to a place you have write permissions.

As long as you using LaTeX to make them, yes. I've just written quite a 
large paper which has to be submitted in Word, in which all of my graphs 
are done using pgfplots (which is built on pgf/Tikz). Look at the 
"externalisation" part of Tikz. This lets you extract out EPS images, 
which you can then use for whatever.

Of course: TeX Live won't accept packages without sources, after all. 
Look in the /doc/generic/pgf/text-en. Be warned there are lots of files!

i installed texshop today from the mactex 2009 bundle, but when i start a simple example, i have the same error message:

/Users/kaspermasschaeler/Library/TeXShop/bin/platex2pdf-euc: line 12: ptex:

can you please tell me how can i solve this problem? Because I donot understand your answer :


Indeed, /Users/<your-short-name>/Library/TeXShop/bin/platex2pdf-euc has

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/teTeX/bin

and /usr/local/teTeX doesn't exist any more in MacTeX; this was used
in gwTeX, which indeed had pTeX.



Many many thanks!

I suspect the Makefile is mainly for Till, etc. Using a copy of the CVS 
source of pgf, I got things to compile by moving pgfmanual.tex and the 
config file into the same place as all the .tex sources, doing a bit of 
hand editing and then letting things run. (I'm on Windows anyway, so the 
Makefile is no use here!)

Kasper,

If by ``simple example'' you mean something with Latin and math characters, I don't understand why pLaTeX is getting in the way. Maybe you have some old

~/Library/TeXShop    (directory)

and

~/Library/Preferences/TeXShop.plist

If you move them out of your Library, TeXShop will rebuild them the next time you launch it. Anyway, I'm forwarding your message to Richard Koch.

Best,

Axel

Howdy,

1)I don't think p(la)tex is part of TeX Live.
2)That script in ~/TeXShop/bin/ is very old and the PATH it sets is for an old tetex (older gwTeX?) distribution.

Good Luck,

Yes. But still failed.  I think this is a directory layout problem.
The Make file set the TEXINPUTS=../../text-en for me, it amounts to:

$ TEXINPUTS=../../text-en pdflatex pgfmanual.tex

but this result in:

kpathsea: Running mktextex pgfmanual.tex
! I can't find file `pgfmanual.tex'.
<*> pgfmanual.tex


But if without TEXINPUTS setting and do it directly:

$ pdflatex pgfmanual.tex

I will get another error:

In short:
Yes, 'TeX doesn't have a changable "current directory", so that all
files you refer to have to be specified relative to the same directory
as the main file.'

Just tested:

~/works/tex/test/paths

~/works/tex/test/paths/chapter1
  chap1.tex
    \include{sec1-1}

Really? Are you sure it's not 'TEXINPUTS=../../text-en:' with a trailing colon?
Without a trailing colon, the default search paths are not used any more...

OK, I admit to only having tested the Makefile. There the command line
expands to (syntax for shell/bash):

TEXINPUTS="../../text-en:${TEXINPUTS}" pdflatex pgfmanual.tex

Well, there are ways...

You already were told one version. I use a rather easy approach for a
project with several main files (choosing different parts of the overall
project), sometimes creating quite a deep nesting of \input'ed files and
subdirectories. Here it is.  Use it like \INPUT{filename} to input a file
in the current directory, and \INPUT[directory]{filename} to input a file
in a different directory, giving relative path from the current directory.

One possible problem is the macro \g at addto@macro. I do not remember out of
the top of my head where it comes from -- maybe it is rather low level TeX,
but maybe it is from one of the many packages I usually load. If you can't
find it, I'll search for you if you want. It appends something to an
existing macro (in a global definition).

I never worked with \graphicspath (something from the graphics/graphicx
package), so I just added a hint for it here. I really should get to
testing this part ;-)

% needs package ifthen; load it if not yet loaded:
\RequirePackage{ifthen}
% this is the current path:
\newcommand{\DIR}{.}
% save current path in this internal macro:
\newcommand{\@SAVEDIR}{}\let\@SAVEDIR\DIR
% Call to \input, with an optional argument giving the (relative)
% directory:
\newcommand{\INPUT}[2][]{%
    \begingroup%
	    \let\@SAVEDIR\DIR% must not be \global\let !
	    \ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{}}{}{\g at addto@macro{\DIR}{/#1}}%
		%   \graphicspath{{\DIR}}%
	    \expandafter\input{\DIR/#2}%
	    \global\let\DIR\@SAVEDIR%
    \endgroup%
}

Perhaps this helps...

	Susan

It is in latex.ltx/ltclass.dtx, used for \At... hooks.

Look at import.sty, and see if it is suitable.

Hi everyone,

in the Times Literary Supplement for Dec 11, 2009, on p. 17, in the review
"Here is the world elsewhere" by Eric Griffiths (review of Shakespeare's
Roman tragedies as performed by the Toneelgroep, Amsterdam in the Barbican
Theatre), I read the following:

"the text which, via a LaTeX Beamer and Powerpoint, steered English
speakers through the Dutch they were hearing in performance."

It is the first time that I encountered a mention of LaTeX in "general"
(i. e. non-specialist) press.

Yours,

In addition there have been about 20 monographs, including one in 
Arabic, English, Greek and Latin, and the recent translation of 
Coarelli's /Rome/.  Almost the entire corpus of the works of Erasmus is 
set using TeX.  There are numerous Greek studies set using TeX in 
Europe, along with others in mediaeval Italian history and literature.  
A massive study of surgical instruments found in the Pompeii excavations 
was done in TeX and the associated map of Pompeii (often complimented by 
derivative imitations) was done using Metafont in a fairly unusual way.

I guess this amounts to a sort of humanist specialization, but it is one 
in which math mode hardly ever appears.  That may be one of the reasons 
why, to quote your response:

It is the first time that I encountered a mention of LaTeX in "general"
(i. e. non-specialist) press.


An associated reason may be the all too general sense that derived forms 
of TeX, most specifically LaTeX, are of interest exclusively as vehicles 
for the swift production of technical papers, which LaTeX, to do it 
justice, seems to be very good at.  All the major examples of humanist 
publication I am directly aware of avoid LaTeX.  We do lots of 
non-technical typesetting, but we see so little interest in anything 
that is not primarily in math mode that we don't find the occasion to 
say much about it.

Any TEXINPUTS method does not work. Even I added '.' to the TEXINPUTS
list, pdflatex still cannot find pgfmanual.tex under the current
directory.

So I have to cp pgfmanual.tex to the ../../text-en and modify some
file references by \input{...}, and this works.

Pierre,

thanks for information of which I have not been aware (is TeX mentioned
anywhere in the impressum of those publications?). My point was that it is
nice to see LaTeX mentioned casually and al pari with the more "household"
--- or office? --- name of PowerPoint (the review where Beamer is
mentioned discusses mainly performances of Shakespeare, though author
muses a bit on esthetics of surtitles in theatre).

I can only confirm what you wrote about LaTeX and humanist publication,
though. When I first thought about trying out TeX / LaTeX, I too was a bit
put off by characterizations such as "LaTeX, a typesetting tool and
language designed specifically for technical document preparation". Then I
found that it is possible to typeset classical Greek with it...

I can add _Phoenix_ (for 20 years, University of Toronto Press) to the
list of Classics journals being set in plain Tex.

Also most of the _Phoenix_ Supp vols (also UTP) and now the Toronto
Mediaeval Latin Text series vols -- the first TeX'd one is coming out
this spring. Greek, Hebrew, Arabic all used in these.

My project has gotten large enough that when I run "!tex" in my bash
shell it takes quite a while before I'm looking at the resulting PDF.
This gets rather annoying, since I'm new enough to TeX that I really
do have to be constantly looking at the output of every line as I type
it, line by line (for fear of accruing too many syntax mistakes).

How the heck do people go about writing 20+ page projects in TeX?

Another issue is that I'm using epsf.tex from CTAN to include
postscript figures in my document, and that really slows things down
even more.

Any advice?

I assume that you use latex instead of tex. Also I advise you to use
pdflatex which will produce pdf while latex gives dvi.

> How the heck do people go about writing 20+ page projects in TeX?
Focus on content of a document not on the syntax. The set of neccessary
commands are small enough (text emphasizing, formatting environment, greek
letters access and maths evironments). So just type and if you do an
error in syntax latex will complain when it will be run on document.
Check the document syntax go on. After some time you will do less errors
than in beginning.

See, fo example "Not So Short Introduction into LaTeX".

Don't use it. Just don't use it at all. There is graphics bundle and
graphicx package for (pdf)latex. Use only it.

Divide your project into several smaller files. Suppose you have 
main.tex with all your macro definitions (your preamble if you're in 
LaTeX), then you can dispatch parts of your document in partA.tex, 
partB.tex, partC.tex... And then in main.tex you \input them:

\input partA.tex
\input partB.tex
\input partC.tex

The interesting thing is that when you're working on, say, part C, you 
don't need to input the previous parts, so:

%\input partA.tex
%\input partB.tex
\input partC.tex

Page numbering and cross-references will go wrong but if you're only 
interested in not doing syntax errors at this stage of the process, you 
don't mind.

Patrick

Here are some ideas that may help:

1. Split your tex source into pieces in separate files. Then use  
latex's \include and \includeonly commands to only typeset portions of  
your document. Each piece will start in a new page but that may be ok  
- and at the end when you're ready you can change thr \include to  
\input to noon it all up

2 split into separate file pieces and \input them. For testing  
segments comment out the \input s you don't want to see. This may give  
some undefined references butaybe that doesn't matter

3.  Define a new command to temporarily skip segments of text eg  
\newcommamd\skiptext[1]{} then take the text you want to skip and  
surround it with braces ie

\skiptext{
...... text to skip
}

When you want to see it either remove this or

\renewcommand[1]\skiptext{#1}

Again cross-references will be unresolved. I use this often especially  
when generating presentations using Beamer which can slow things down

4 do a one-time conversion of all your figs to PDF and use pdflatex  
with the graphicx package. If you include the graphics without it's  
suffix pdflatex will find the PDF versions so they can live in the  
same directory. There are lots of ways to do this depending on your  
operating system. I would use epstopdf if you start from eps files or  
ps2pdf or pstopdf from ps files. Pdfcrop will trim off any White space  
borders although epstopdf does a good job most of the time. Other  
tools can do this operation. If all else fails write a tiny latex file  
that will do it in the way you currently do ie using epsi or whatever  
then trim the whitespace using pdfcrop or the trim options in the  
\includegraphics[trim .....]{myfig} command. (note myfig and NOT  
myfig.pdf)

HTH

Best
Wishes for the new year

Patrick, I'm currently "managing editor" for a geology book which tops 
out at about 160 graphics-heavy pages, the chapters of which format in 
seconds (we don't do the whole book at the moment), so be reassured that 
there is an answer to your problem!

Along the lines of what others have posted, I suggest you create a 
"driver file" which contains package includes, command definitions and 
other common stuff.  Have it include a separate file for the front 
matter (title page, list of figures, ... all the stuff that typically 
has roman numerals for page numbers), and then one for each chapter (or 
other major section).  If you have back matter (bibliography, 
acknowledgements, index ...) then make each of those separate files as 
well.  Call your "driver" file something that makes sense for your 
document, and then give the other files names that start with the same 
string and have "-1", "-2", "-glossary", suffixes.

Now the best bit.  Look up the \includeonly command.  It will allow you 
to format just one chapter (actually more than one if you wish), but in 
such a way that page numbers are maintained, references come out and so 
on.

So if your project is called "foo", your driver file is foo.tex and 
looks like this:

% all your definitions and \usepackage statements not shown

\includeonly{foo-1}  % format only chapter 1, in this instance

\begin{document}

\include{foo-0}      % front matter
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\include{foo-1}      % Chapter 1
\include{foo-2}      % Chapter 2 ... etc
\include{foo-3}
\backmatter
\include{foo-gloss}  % glossary
\include{foo-ack}    % acknowledgements

\end{document}

Using pdflatex, find out about the "-jobname" parameter, which allows 
you to output into "foo-chapter1.pdf" (for example) when you're 
formatting just chapter 1, and so on.

The problem may be in the nonstandard way you are handling graphics.  
I have a 600 page book in the works. With TeXshop it compiles in nine  
seconds. (Of course, I broke it up into separate files, with one  
chapter per file, and have a driver file to call them all. When I'm  
writing, I use a different driver file which calls up only the  
chapter I'm working on. Those files compile quickly enough that it is  
possible to compile the file after every edit if I wanted to.  
TeXshop, like a lot of other implementations, has a feature which  
enables you to command-click on a word in your output and go to that  
point in your source, and it will trace the source back to the  
separate file for the chapters.)

Message-ID: <200912230955.19677.mdoob@ccu.umanitoba.ca>

I recently built a web page for interactive tex: html input of
type=text is used to enter the TeX source and a page is generated with
the corresponding TeX output. 

In my case I am working in a LAMP environment (P=php), so there
were a number of options available: I used dvipng to generate
the TeX output to be displayed. I wasn't totally happy with
my results, so I'm asking the following question: what's your
favourite way to implement this type of interactive TeX? I guess 
there are actually two slightly different answers: one for trusted 
users and one where the input has to be scrubbed (with something 
like the php escapeshellcommand function).

Cheers,
Michael

Subject: [texhax] book of poems
Message-ID: <4B324ACA.90900@gmx.de>

Hi!

I want to typeset a book of poems. There is one problem I don?t have any
clue how to solve ?
If a line of type is too wide, it must be broken. But as the lines in
poems are fixed, it mostly is set like (monospaced font!):

This is a very short poem to show the
And this is the next line!       [problem]

So the last word (or two, maybe), is set in the next line if that is
short enough.
Has anyone an idea how this could be implemented? Maybe a first step
would be an implementation like

This is a very short poem to show the
                                 [problem]
And this is the next line!

That already would help me much!

cheers
Arno

Have a look at the Memoir package, IIRC that has plenty of
support for poems, quotes and suchlike.

Patrick

This sounds like a description of working with LaTeX on a PC  20 to 25
years ago.  Currently I work in Windows XP (32-bit) or Ubuntu
(64-bit).  When I am preparing a document I use the tex to dvi to
postscript to pdf rout.  I include my graphics in eps format.  At the
drafting stage I stop at the dvi stage.  I use specials to enable me
to move back and fore between the tes source and the dvi file.  tex to
dvi for a moderate sized document (< 100 pages) is almost
instantaneous.  My main source editor at the moment is Emacs although
I do use Kyle in Ubuntu and Texmaker and TeXniCenter in Windows and
still get the same throughput.  The production of the dvi file is
slowed on occasion is some new fonts have to be generated but this is
rare.  The dvi to ps step can take a few seconds and the ps to pdf is
not quite instantaneous.

Judging on my experience you might consider using the kind of process
that I use.  If it does not work then there is something wrong with
your computer or your setup.

Best Wishes for Christmas.

Patrick,

I will keep this message short as you have already gotten plenty of good 
advice.

The LaTeX source editor to which John referred is properly written as 
"Kile," and the address of the project's homepage is below:

http://kile.sourceforge.net/

While Kile 2.1 is currently listed as unstable, I haven't had any major 
problems running it in Ubuntu 9.04 (32-bit).

I should note that I'm using Plain TeX. (I expect some of you might
have picked up on that from my use of epsf.tex).

I'm going to try the \input method, where you keep separate chapters
in separate files; sounds like it'll work :-)

Good to know that LaTeX has plenty of ways to do this too,
\includeonly looks especially interesting.

Thanks for all the advice,
-Patrick

P.S. I really was pleasantly surprised to see this many responses,
when I only just posted the question 14 hours ago :-)

Another option with plain TeX is that, in addition to having a separate 
tex file for each chapter, also more all your macros to a separate file, 
say preamble.tex. Then, in preamble.tex define a macro

\def\mypreambleloaded{\relax}

and start the individual chapter files by

\ifx\undefined\mypreambleloaded \input preamble \fi

Then you can compile each file individually without making any changes 
in the sources.

Arno,

as I recall, the poemscol package
(<http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/poemscol/>) also
has a lot of useful solutions for typesetting poetry.

Well, if you're going that route, you could put the intelligence
into the preamble itself :

% Preamble.TeX

\expandafter
\ifx \csname preamble already loaded\endcsname \relax
      \message {Preamble loading ...}
      \edef \next
          {\let \csname preamble already loaded\endcsname
              = \noexpand \empty
          }
\else
      \message {Preamble already loaded.}
      \let \next = \endinput
\fi
\next

<remainder of preamble>

and then each chapter file need simply \input Preamble

- free or almost free tools;
- teaching texts;
- homework styles;
- cross-platform tools.

We encourage you to submit original papers describing your experiences
using LaTeX and TeX tools in an academic setting, and also papers
on tool development work in progress or completed.

** Submission Guidelines:
If you would like to submit an article or technical note for
publication please contact the editors pracjourn at tug.org.
We will work with you to prepare the article.  Also see

Subject: [texhax] Calendar
Message-ID: <4b3478c4.8zQmDSbbtOkDSuA3%punosevac72@gmail.com>

Dear All,

Even though I am a TeX/LaTeX user of almost 20 years this is my first 
message to this mailing list.

I am curious what is recommended way for creating various Calendars.
Namely, I have been using for a while a simple template found at

http://www.math.duke.edu/computing/tex/templates.html

for creating monthly calendar with the lessons plan for courses that I
teach. Couple nights ago I tried to dig dipper into the subject and to
my big surprise I found only two credible references to for packages
related to calendars.

One is http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/calendar/
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/contrib/pst-calendar/

What I am really looking for is a templet in the style of AMS cover
sheet i.e. a TeX file which will interactively ask me a few questions
(like a range of the Calendar) and then create a file a calendar.dvi and
a file calendar.dat which might be then further edited by hand.

Also it seems to me that in term of graphics even by a very simple use
of colortbl package I could create quite fancy Monthly calendar.

Most Kind Regards, 
Predrag Punosevac

P.S. I should mention that I am using TeXLive 2009 on OpenBSD. I should
also mention that I use 85% of time LaTeX and the rest of the time plan
TeX as well as that I have strong preference for PSTricks over other
graphics tools.

TikZ? has an excellent calendar library. By looking at the manual, it
seems to be pretty powerful and flexible.

\latexhtml{\begin{longtable}{p{0,5\textwidth}p{0,45\textwidth}}}{\begin{longtable}{lp{20cm}}}
\latex{\multicolumn{2}{r}{\footnotesize{Fortsetzung folgt auf der n?chsten Seite\dots}}\\}
\latex{\endfoot}
\latex{\endlastfoot}
	\raisebox{-0.8\height}{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{foo}} & some text goes here\\
	\raisebox{-0.8\height}{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{boom}} & some text goes here too\\
\end{longtable}
---------

Unfortunately, the images nearly stick together vertically. So there is no space between the first and the second row and therefore between the images.

How could I create a little space between the rows?

Thanks in advance

You set the height of the second image to a bit more than the
"natural" 0.2\height it has after you moved it down:

\listfiles
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\raisebox{-0.8\height}{\rule{1cm}{4cm}}&text\\
\raisebox{-0.8\height}[0.25\height]{\rule{1cm}{4cm}}&text\\
\end{tabular}
\end{document}

Subject: [texhax] bad printout of large brackets
Message-ID: <20091229033057.14272oxox93aw1wk@mail.ateneo.net>

Hello, everybody!

I have a problem on my latex printout.

I am using WinEdt to typeset my LaTeX file. I have two examples below.

\[ f(x)=\left\{
\begin{array}{lcl}
\dfrac{2}{2-x} & & \mbox{if $0 \le x < 2$} \\
\\
0 & & \mbox{if $x \ge 2$,}
\end{array}
\right. \]

\[ \left\{
\begin{array}{lcl}
2x & \equiv & 11 \pmod{13} \\
3x & \equiv & 7 \pmod{9} \\
7x & \equiv & 5 \pmod{8}
\end{array}
\right. \]

After I compile it using pdflatex, in the paper printout, the big  
bracket turns out not a solid curly bracket, but a broken one. There  
are some breaks near the middle of the curl in the printout. Only on  
the printed copy on the paper, but the pdf copy I see onscreen is  
perfect. I use pdflatex compilation because I have figures in pdf  
format.

Can you please help me again?

Thank you very much... and happy new year to everyone!

Best regards,
Ian June

If what you see on screen looks good, it seems to be a bug in your
printer or in the printer driver.  There is no reason to avoid
pdflatex.  I can't provide a solution but there are several things you
can try.  Many printers understand more than one graphic format, I've
never seen a PostScript printer which doesn't understand at least PCL5
or PCL6 too.

First, find out what you actually send to the printer.  Then look into
the manual in order to find out what else your printer understands.
Ghostscript can translate PostScript and PDF to many other formats
which printers understand.  You can circumvent bugs in the PostScript
interpreter if you convert the file to PCL5, for instance, and send the
PCL5 file to the printer.

Remote diagnosis is very difficult, but it's easier to provide help if
you tell us which operating system you are using, which printer you
have, and, if you are on Windows, whether the TeX distribution you are
using provides a program "pdftops".

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] tikzpicture of predefined width and subfig
Message-ID: <19af81400912290106k1cdc20a7l907ab53b31c549c1@mail.gmail.com>

Assume that I know how to create tikz-graphics

\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[thin,->] (-2.3,0)--(2.5,0) node[below]{$x$};
\draw[thin,->] (0,-1)--(0,1.3) node[right]{$f(x)$};
\draw[ultra thick, domain=-2.3:2.3, smooth] plot function  {x^2};
\end{tikzpicture}

So far so good. Now I want to embed it in my article through figure or
subfloat. To do it properly I need to predefine width or scale.
Usually I create graphics externally (using pgf/tikz and then embed,
but scaling leads to inconsistency in font sizes and line widths. So,
how I create the same graph albeit 0.5\linewidth in its width?



Sure, I can play with [x=0.09\linewidth] where I 0.1\linewidth would
come from allocating 0.5\linewidth to this picture and noting that its
x-span is 5:

\begin{tikzpicture}[x=0.09\linewidth]
\draw[thin,->] (-2.5,0)--(2.5,0) node[below]{$x$};
\draw[thin,->] (0,-1)--(0,1.3) node[right]{$f(x)$};
\draw[ultra thick, domain=-2.3:2.3, smooth] plot function  {x^2};
\end{tikzpicture}

However I would like something more automatic
<PGF/TIKZ manual seems to ignore this question>

Thank you in advance

Hello,

The subject explains everything: I want to start the page numbering from the last page number and decrement it until it's 0 (for the last page). A mathematical operation for this would be: \thepage - \pageref{LastPage}, but how to include it in fancyhdr (for a book class) ?

Happy new year,
