I don't use MiKTeX, nor TeXnicCenter (nor Windows, for that matter),  
but see if this helps:

Nice. However, if you are on that page 

    http://www.usna.edu/Users/ee/cameronc/Miscellaneous/LaTeX/LaTeX.html

why are you at #MiKTeX and want to install "to TeXnicCenter"? Right before there is the link to 

    http://www.tug.org/protext

where installation may be simpler. It *is* step by step. 

Also the other things on the page are explained "step by step".

Hi all,

I am looking for a collection of handy macros to manipulate

Does anybody know if such a thing already exists? Googleing

Many thanks. Best, Michael Tung

This is a report of what I believe is a flaw in the "\loop"  
implementation.
The appended source text behaves differently with and without the  
\null-command.
Instead of \null, almost any other command can be used.
The flaw came to my attention when I first used a \showthe for error  
analysis.

The used system is OS X 10.5.5.
The TeX system is TeXShop V2.26 with  XeTeXk, Version  
3.1415926-2.2-0.999.6 (Web2C 7.5.7)

A \fi doesn't unterrupt the assignment to the counter more. TeX
continues to read/expand commands to find more numbers. You can even
use \if-commands inside the assignment:

\newcount\more \more=1 % 

\ifx aa \more=0\fi 2
\the\more

\more=1\ifnum3=4 5\else6\fi7
\the\more
\bye

To stop the assignment, use \relax \more=0\relax 
or a space:  \more=0 \fi

The problem lies in the incomplete assignment
to \more; better would be the following --

\ifeof 1\more = 0\relax \fi

This really surprises me. Here in Norway, doublesided printing is very 
common. Why is singlesided printing used?

Most dissertations use doublespacing (or often 1.5-spacing), though, 
especially in the humanities. (For maths, most people seem to just use 
the LaTeX defaults, or perhaps with abominations like the ?a4wide? 
packages.)

Also, a few years ago, the university I?m at changed to the paper size from 
A4 to 240 ? 170 mm for PhD dissertations. I think it?s an excellent format, 
but too often the original (A4) source material is just scaled down, leading 
to a too small actual font size.

Also, duplexing on machines which aren't designed for it may damage  
the printer, spoil the toner cartridge or result in offsetting to  
following sheets, or all of the above.

I think I read once an article that basically said that it is/was believed that singlesided, doublespaced, left-justified material is easier on the eyes/allows faster reading. 

In my opinion it was probably a matter of convenience followed by academic inertia.

Download the file ProTeXt-2.2-071608.exe or a later version with a
similar name.  it is a large file.  Save to a temporary director and
run then file.  This is a self extracting archive and will create a
subdirectory called protext-2.2. (As the file is large this may take
some time). In that subdirectory run setup.exe.  Confirm the
installation language and select next.  This will open the
installation pdf and you can print it from this window.

You will also find a copy in the subdirectory ....\ProTeXt-2.2\Install.

If you are reading material with the task of marking it
then double spaced, single sided, allows for comments.

I believe single sided is preferred for prepress machine processing
(copying, printing) to avoid recto/verso misalignment.
So this applies if your thesis is likely to be bound/published 
at some later date.

Neighbors,

I?ve been trying to get ntheorem to format my examples with hanging
indents, and after some experimentation & googling have come to the
conclusion that this might be impossible.  (See, e.g.,
<http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_frm/thread/c00bd513594bc909>.)


On the other hand, perhaps some clever use of hangparas within amsthm?s
or ntheorem?s \newtheoremstyle might work.

On the gripping hand, I?m left with trying a DIY theorem-like environment.

Any suggestions for me?

I believe that unusual thesis printing rules originated from the idea 
that someone might actually read the thesis. In that case the reader 
might want to cover the pages with notes and leaving lots of white space 
was helpful. It's the same idea with copies for refereeing when we used 
to do it on paper.

With the huge increase in the yearly number of thesis, the resulting 
lowering of quality, the use of digital distribution methods, and the 
fact that most thesis are not read by anyone other than the committee 
(and many members avoid reading where possible) the rules now seem 
outdated. But so are a lot of traditions both within academia and without.

I'm typesetting a book but I may also need to let the publisher pick
the fonts we're going to use. If they give me some arbitrary TrueType
or OpenType fonts will I be able to convert them for use with pdfLaTeX
in such a way that it will still be able to do:

 1. Ligatures
 2. Proper kerning
 3. All the fancy stuff the microtype package does (esp. hanging punctuation)
 4. Anything else I would care about if I knew enough to care.

Yes, but it'd be better if you started w/ a Type 1 version w/ a normal  
font / expert font pair to avoid conversion issues IMO.

To use an OpenType or TrueType font w/ pdftex so, for the traditional  
setup, you'll need to:

0. check and see if the font license allows for modification /  
extraction
1. convert it into Type 1 fonts (if it's opentype), setting the  
encoding appropriately for each font, for TrueType fonts you'll need  
to break it down into 8-bit chunks each w/ appropriate encodings
2. join all of those together into a virtual font, adding in
3. install all of the pieces into pdftex

1 is covered by FontForge, though you'll likely need to do a bit of  
manual work. 2 is covered by fontinst and related utilities ---  
excellent documentation on them in

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/fontinstallationguide.html

and 3 is the standard updmap or equivalent utilities as covered in  
your tex installation local guide / documentation.

There is a script for doing this sort of thing (though it uses  
different tools), but I've not used it:

http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/code/otfinst/

I believe you'd find it much easier to use xetex or luatex though,  
since that wouldn't require fiddling w/ encodings &c. xetex would  
``just work'', though since it doesn't have explicit hanging  
punctuation one would need to handle this via macros and active  
characters (see Peter Wilson's hanging package). luatex is still in  
beta, but may be workable for your project --- if you try it I'm sure  
folks on the luatex list will be glad to help out.

Message-ID: <4A27FD81.6070905@gmail.com>

How can I get the date in my LaTeX article to display the ordinal
indicator in superscript?  E.g., July 4<sup>th</sup>, 1776

I?m using XeLaTeX, so I can manually get the effect I want via ?July
4\textsuperscript{th}, 1776?; I?d like to know how to get the effect
automatically.

Thanks,

How did you install TeX? Which distribution did you use?

Most likely, you already have PSTricks.

I would suggest not to use \hbox but \text instead (using the amstext  
package), so that you get the right font in the right size everywhere:

\def\mydate{\ifcase\day\or

2. Or type "ordinal" into the field for "Search the package descriptions" on

    http://ctan.tug.org/search.html

there are several packages for ordinal numbers in dates.

Yes.  For nth.sty the form is

\usepackage[super]{nth}
..
\nth{\day}

I moved the \ifcase\month to the front and replaced the $^{hbox{?}}$
with \textsuperscript{?}, then added
	\date{\mydate}
?that works OK.

So I followed Uwe & Donald's advice, and kept an eye out for how the
packages format the raised ordinals. Since the nth package uses
\textsuperscript rather than playing math games, I thought to say:
	\usepackage[super]{nth}
	\def\mydate{\ifcase\month\or
		January\or February\or March\or April\or May\or June\or July\or August\or
		September\or October\or November\or December\fi~\nth{day},\space
\number\year}
	\date{\mydate}
But that?s not working?I get a "missing number" from \maketitle.  What
am I doing wrong?

Also, I?d like to hook in into LaTeX date formatting so that the
\today command will be formatted as I?d prefer.

Not an easy task, especially for Slavic languages: see "Ordinal
Numbers in Various Languages" on Typophile at
<http://typophile.com/node/42577>.  Some languages have different
suffixes for singular & plural, or for gender, or for case(!).

In the restricted sense of dates, one hopes that all days of the month

Never mind; I noticed I was using \nth{day} instead of \nth{\day};
fixed & now it works.

And I found datetime.sty.  All is well.

Thanks for the help,

No.  It is hat it is and makes no claims to 
cover multiple languages.  (The CTAN catalogue
description correctly lists the languages of 
various packages.)

Philip,

Just wanted to thank you for your solution to the xcolor/longtable issue.  I have been beating my head to figure out why it doesn't work, and came across your article (written in 2005!) Not sure if you are still at this e-mail address, but just thought I'd drop a thank you.

You could try
$a/b$ 
which might give you a slash comparable to the size of a and b.  That 
is what I do.

Message-ID: <d2e22f8e0906071220t2aee2536q4270ac13b3569bdb@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a general methodology question concerning tables in LaTeX and I was
just wondering what the collective wisdom of the list thought.

Currently I am making tables using a spreadsheet then saving the file as a
.csv file, replacing commas with an ampersand and then formatting the table
to include in a .tex file. The problem I am running into is that if I want
to modify the table after this process (say add a column) I have to start
from scratch at the spreadsheet level which can be fairly time consuming. I
just wondering what other people do to make this more efficient. That is,
how do people go about making tables and modifying then after some edits
have been made.

Anyways, thanks in advance!

Sam

I'm not using spreadsheets, but I often have the need to do something
more than once.  I usually write a little Perl script, but every other
scripting language is fine as well.

There is also an experimental package on CTAN, but I don't know
anything about it:

Scripts are a great answer. For my textbook I eventually
developed a build script (Make or Perl are useful component choices)
to process every source, regenerating data if something changed.
This part is essential to avoid long build times that revise
data even if it hasn't changed.

The idea is to keep the authorative sources of data at the root of
the build process and eliminate every manual step you can.

Many popular packages like Matlab, Octave, R 
can export latex table forms with a suitable function/plugin.

If you're building a large document, thesis, report, or textbook 
then the time spent writing a little script is quickly repaid.

Folks,

Two years back, when CrossTeX 0.5 was announced, I managed to get it
installed under Windows. I?m now trying again, with CrossTeX 0.6, but am
running into some problems, possibly Python-related.

Has anyone else on the list gotten either version of CrossTeX working
under Windows that might help me trouble-shoot?

Reading this, I recalled a Ross Moore reply to the TeX on Mac OS X  
mailing list, which you can see here (yes, 2004):

http://tug.org/pipermail/macostex-archives/2004-April/005417.html

Crudely adapting his code, one can construct something like this:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}

\newcommand{\fracoffrac}[2]{\mathchoice
  {\raise.25ex\hbox{$#1$}\hbox{\large$\mkern-2mu/\mkern-2mu$}\lower. 
25ex\hbox{$#2$}}%
  {\raise.25ex\hbox{\small$#1$}\hbox{$\large\mkern-1mu/\mkern-2mu$} 
\lower.25ex\hbox{\small$#2$}}%
  {\raise.15ex\hbox{\small$\scriptstyle#1$}/\lower.15ex\hbox{\small$ 
\scriptstyle#2$}}%
  {\raise.1ex\hbox{\small$\scriptscriptstyle#1$}/\lower.1ex\hbox{\small 
$\scriptscriptstyle#2$}}%
}

\begin{document}

\[
\fracoffrac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{3}{4}}
\]

In text mode: $\fracoffrac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{3}{4}}$, and some more  
text.

\end{document}

Best,

Axel

I use the gnome office spreadsheet application, gnumeric, for this.
http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/

It reads/writes excel files and is extremely compatible with it in terms
of look&feel and functionality.

It exports quite good latex tables, that can be latex'ed standalone if
you wish. Or if you cut'n'paste the preamble into your main tex source,
you can \input the file without touching it. Then if you make changes
and re-export it (to a file of the same name), it will obviously update
for you.

There's a windows version, but I run it on a linux box.

You can also add tex code to the spreadsheet directly. Either in
(hiddens) columns and rows or as formatting instructions.

You could try the datatool package. It can load data from csv files into 
a database, and you can then either iterate through the database or 
place it in a tabular/longtable.

I take it that you mean they are missing from the math fonts.  If so does
this help?

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document} 
$a\mbox{'}$
$a\text{'}$ % requires amsmath
\end{document} 

If not, please be more explicit.

Subject: [texhax] 'verbatim' inside 'raisebox'?
Message-ID: <20090610160121.GQ21609@email.mot.com>

I need to put pre-formatted text (ala HTML <PRE> or <CODE>) within
a 'raisebox'.  AFAICT the Tex way to do this is via 'verbatim'
(though I'd welcome alternative suggestions).  But Tex (specific-
ally, pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.21a-2.2) fails on the 2nd clos-

My simplest test case:

     {
        \begin{verbatim}
           Some text

I see the same issue if I include "\usepackage{verbatim}".

Any suggestions?  Thanks,

I don't think my larger use case matters, but just in case:  I'm using
the message sequence chart package from
<http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/msc/>.  Some of
my MSC message flows require formatted text, and 'raisebox' so the
message line/arrow doesn't overlap the text, so it's on a '\mess' that
I'm trying to use 'raisebox' and within that 'verbatim'.

Hello, 

I have been using Tex Live 7 for sometime. My company is in the process
of switching to a Vesta Operating system.

I am hoping that the version of the software I currently own is
compatible to the new operating system and would appreciate your
confirmation.

Tom:

The short answer is that nothing involving verbatim is simple, because
verbatim sneaks around all the other rules.  I remember there are some
tricks to getting verbatim text into a box, but I don't remember what
they are, though I think they involve some inside hooks into the
verbatim package.  

However poor my memory, I did once know this in order to modify a
package to put verbatim text in a box, and apparently I wrote docstrip
comments in a dtx file to explain it all.  You can get the files at
http://sgouros.com/vcode.dtx and http://sgouros.com/vcode.ins.

Hope this helps, 

 -Tom

Hello Magda,

Either the current TeX Live, TeX Live 2008 (www.tug.org/texlive) or
MiKTeX (www.miktex.org) should work fine on Vista.

It is well known that verbatim environments are difficult ... 

    http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/fancybox/fancybox.pdf

discusses this on pp. 18ff. and offers some solutions. 

However, for \raisebox with only *short* (part of line) verbatim text the problem may be much easier than with listings that verbatim etc. are made for: 

    \newsavebox{\mybox}
    \begin{lrbox}{\mybox}
    \verb|\stuff|
    \end{lrbox}
    A\raisebox{1ex}{\usebox{\mybox}} B

Subject: [texhax] Extract equations as EPS from larger doc?
Message-ID: <200906102009.48743.janert@ieee.org>


For a (non-LaTeX) publishing project I will have to 
provide equations as images.

I would like to use LaTeX to set the equations and
to generate the image files (as EPS).

The main problem is the document management -
it would be nice to be able to have a single LaTeX
document, and ideally a clever tool that extracts
equations as individual EPS files.

Since this seems like a recurring problem, I wonder
whether somebody knows of a LaTeX macro package
or other tool that facilitiates this process. I looked on 
CTAN, but did not find anything that seemed suitable.

(I can do this manually, by placing each equation
on a separate page and then operating with ps2eps,
but I was wondering whether this problem has already
been solved in a more general/convenient way.)

Any suggestions?

Best,

		Ph.

The html converters latex2html and hyperlatex both do this, and you can
probably get something useful by peeking at their code (perl and
lisp, respectively).  Google will help you find them.

I had some reason to look into similar things some years back. My own
notes provide the following summary of what I found, though I'll confess
that I forget exactly how any of them work. Most are geared toward
bitmap output, but perhaps not all.

PS As an alternative for something with vector capabilities, I think I'd
be inclined to put the equations on separate plain (pagestyle{empty})
pages, use pdflatex to generate a pdf, then run the result through
pdfcrop to trim all the white space. Finally something from the
pdftoolkit pdftk will split the resulting multi-page pdf into separate
pages, meaning separate pdf's for each equation.

=================================
There are a variety of things that will take in latex and spit out
images (gifs or pngs) that I've discovered. They include:

Please see whethere this helps:

   \documentclass{article}
   \usepackage{fancyvrb}

   \begin{document}

   \begin{SaveVerbatim}{verbox}
   Some verbatim text
   \end{SaveVerbatim}

   Some formatted text

An idea on Lars' idea: 

1. cp foo.toc foo-toc.toc

2. write and run foo-toc.tex like this: 

\documentclass{article}
\nofiles %% don't rewrite foo-toc.toc
\renewcommand{\contentsname}{Contents of that work}
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\end{document}

3. Simply edit foo-toc.toc

Hi, 

I have to edit a critical edition of a medivial source and heared about the latexpackage bigfoot by David Kastrup to do this. But I have a big problem: the publisher want to have so called paired footnotes for the footnote apparatus and I can't manage it. here is an example how it have to look like:

----------------------
|                    |
| Fran?cois Vatable? |
|                    |
|                    |

|                    |
|                    |
| Footnoteapparatus: |
| 2-2 blablabla      |
|                    |
----------------------

I hope I make myself clear and somebody can help me.

Thanks for help.

Have you asked David Kastrup? 

I think it is very easy to implement this with ednotes.sty. But I am very busy (and at the moment exhausted) and can't tell right now when I could do it.

Greetings,

I haven't used the bigfoot package, but there exists a set of LaTeX  
packages for editing critical editions, which permit maintaining two  
or more footnote streams on a given page.  These are called ledmac and  
ledpar, and are currently being maintained by Vafa Khalighi (vafa at users.berlios.de 
).

The packages are available here, together with documentation and  
examples: http://www.djdekker.net/ledmac/ ... they also come included  
with TexLive 2008.

Cheers,
Erik Norvelle

ledpar is essentially used for translations. The "paired footnotes" facility is neither implemented in ledmac currently (as it is not in ednotes). 

For comparisons of ledmac and ednotes, google for ledmac and ednotes at the same time.

Now I guess neither ednotes nor ledmac are useful for this. You "simply" use \footnote, either with manyfoot.sty or with the multi-footnote-levels facility of memoir.cls. This may also work with bigfoot.sty which should be an enhancement of manyfoot. 

You need some (sketch only)

    \newcommand\note[2]{\footnotemark'1\footnotemark}{'2}

and some change of the thing that prints the footnote number usually. Look around what footnote packages offer for this; with manyfoot.sty, I should be able to do this next week, but perhaps you don't need me. 

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

Better: 

     \newcommand{\note}[2]{\footnotemark#1\addtocounter{footnote}{-1}}{\footnote{#2}}

This may be already acceptable, since "2-2" is somewhat redundant. 

The main virtue of ednotes and ledmac is referring by line numbers instead of footnote numbers, but this seems not to be needed here. The facility seems to be missing in bigfoot, but bigfoot may suffice here. As I understand David Kastrup, bigfoot breaks pages (and footnotes) better than manyfoot, but it may depend on the subject whether you realize this difference.

What do the pair of numbers stand for? (Page number and footnote number? 
Or section number and footnote number?)

Not much clearer. bigfoot.pdf looks like having been arranged manually, rather than what has ever been implemented in TeX. 

"paired footnotes" look a little like numbering pagewise by letters, while it was overlooked that one note was removed and the numbering wasn't correct anymore. 

If a key idea is choosing footnote marks manually, this can be done as I suggested before, just think of optional arguments for footnote commands. 

(My last suggestion was "\note{lemma}{remark}" expanding to "\footnotemark lemma\addtocounter{footnote}{-1}\footnote{remark}")

\note could have an optional argument such that "\note[<symbol>]{lemma}{remark}" expands to "{\def\thempfn{<symbol>}\footnotemark lemma \footnote{remark}}". 

To typeset the footnote mark differently in the apparatus, we might modify LaTeX's internal \@makefntext. But before becoming more TeXnical, we need to know something more specific on the footnote layout and how footnote marks are chosen. 

> P.S. I tried to contact David Kastrup, but after I described my problem he haven't answered yet.

Somebody else wrote me that David Kastrup didn't answer a question about bigfoot. He may think that he can't afford doing any more work at bigfoot without being paid. However, he likes to comment on mailing lists. 

Curious,

...but with some undesired side effect: I'm attaching test.tex, to be processed
simply with: `tex test'.  If you comment out lines 2,3,4,5,6,7, the whole text
is shifted down a little.

How can that be avoided?

Thanks for any help

OK, I recognize some rules on 

    http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~latex/Materialien/bigfoot.pdf

There is a "middle" apparatus, where notes are numbered pagewise and alphabetically, and there are "short" and "long" ones. Short ones get one letter only and are gathered in single lines. 

Since that page seems to be part of a LaTeX tutorial at FU Berlin and the file is named bigfoot.pdf, it may have been typeset with bigfoot.sty indeed, David Kastrup may well have implemented such a footnote style that had not existed in manyfoot, (l)edmac, and the TeXbook. 

If I am guessing correctly, you just need instructions about bigfoot commands!?

Not much clearer. bigfoot.pdf looks like having been arranged manually, rather than what has ever been implemented in TeX. 

"paired footnotes" look a little like numbering pagewise by letters, while it was overlooked that one note was removed and the numbering wasn't correct anymore. 

If a key idea is choosing footnote marks manually, this can be done as I suggested before, just think of optional arguments for footnote commands. 

(My last suggestion was "\note{lemma}{remark}" expanding to "\footnotemark lemma\addtocounter{footnote}{-1}\footnote{remark}")

\note could have an optional argument such that "\note[<symbol>]{lemma}{remark}" expands to "{\def\thempfn{<symbol>}\footnotemark lemma \footnote{remark}}". 

To typeset the footnote mark differently in the apparatus, we might modify LaTeX's internal \@makefntext. But before becoming more TeXnical, we need to know something more specific on the footnote layout and how footnote marks are chosen.

ok, this will probably stay off the list. Or is there anybody reading this who likes to guess from David Kastrup files how to use his macros for "paired footnotes"? Or still (Marcel also!) guessing at an implementation without bigfoot ... ? I find this interesting, but I must do other things first ... 

Marcel, regarding the example on the FU page, there is also the matter of "overriding" "single paragraph" mode for "single" footnotes, namely for long ones. This is bigfoot-specific. But do you need this? If not, I still think that the feature can be implemented with manyfoot only, without bigfoot.

Hi:

  I'd appreciate some help with this.

Say you have three equations in an align environment. You want to box
only one of them, say the last one. How does one do this? I want all
three equations aligned (at, say the = sign). Fancybox.sty wasn't of
much help in this regard. I can put the first two eqns in an align, and
the third eqn in an fbox in the equation environment, but the alignment
is disturbed. 

I'd appreciate any suggestions. Thanks.

If you haven't found anything better, here's a not very elegant solution:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\newcommand\alignboxed[2]{\rlap{\boxed{#1#2}}\hphantom{#1\mkern6mu}}
\begin{document}
\begin{align}
  f_1(x) &= a+bx, \\
  f_2(x) &= a+bx+cx?, \\
  \alignboxed{f_3(x)}{= a+bx+cx?+dx?.}
\end{align}
\end{document}

This works similarly:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\def\alignboxed#1&#2\endalignboxed{\rlap{\boxed{#1#2}}\hphantom{#1\mkern6mu}
}
\begin{document}
\begin{align}
  f_1(x) &= a+bx, \\
  f_2(x) &= a+bx+cx?, \\
  \alignboxed
  f_3(x) &= a+bx+cx?+dx?.
  \endalignboxed
\end{align}
\end{document}

Cheers,  Phil

Thanks, Phil. The first example works fine, but the second fails:

ERROR: Illegal unit of measure (mu inserted).

--- TeX said ---
<to be read again> 
                   =
l.13 \end{align}
                
--- HELP ---
If you just got a

      ! Missing number, treated as zero.

error, then this is part of the same problem.

Perhaps I did something wrong, I'll investigate it and let you know.

Thanks again.

Further to my note to Phil's suggestions, I reported that the 2nd
example failed. I discovered that in the definition there was
\mkern6=mu. I don't know whether mutt introduced the equal sign between
6 and mu. Removal of the equal sign makes the 2nd example also work.

Hi all.

Suppose that in a certain place of my text I say something like, e.g.:

be enough to say:

 \vskip 25 pt plus 0 pt minus 0 pt

nothing more, nothing less?  Or should I achieve that by some other commands?

...and, more important, will 25 pt be just the same wherever I am in the text?
I mean, 25 pt on page (say) 9 are the same as 25 pt on page (say) 113?

Well, use a dog for email and what do you expect?  Why not try homing
pigeons?
Sorry, couldn't resist it!  No flames please - for all I know it may well be
man's best friend.

Anyway, my original posting did indeed NOT contain the = sign (it's probably
a sort of continuation symbol used by that mongrel of yours).

Cheers,  Phil

P.S.  unless otherwise indicated, I do always test any code I post.

Rodolfo, 25 pt is indeed 25 pt whatever the place, but there are some
notices: if this vertical space lies on a page break, it will be completely
dismissed. Other thing you must take into account is that you may have more
vertical space than that you declared: \parskip and \baselineskip, for
example, usually are rubber lengths (or glues, if you prefer). Another:
plain TeX allows you to set a magnification for your entire document. So, if
you define a magnification 2, you will get 50 pt instead. Ah, "25 pt" is
exactly the same as "25pt plus 0pt minus 0pt". Did I forget something?

It will be too much.  \vskip will not insert stretchable glue unless you 
tell it to. 

But you can get some surprises if you do not take account of interline 
glue values.  If you want a strict baseline to baseline 25 points, you 
also have to make sure that there is no descender depth counted before 
the transition from hmode into vmode.  My own crude but effective way of 
handling this is to insert a vrule of specific depth greater than any 
glyph depth possible, and then either cancel it or  subtract that amount 
from the following \vskip.  Inelegant, perhaps, but it has saved a lot 
of trouble for the past ten years.  It is one way to get \vadjust 
material on the same baseline as the preceding hmode text.  

You can usually check out the accuracy of the \vskip by turning on 
\tracingpages and looking at the log file, although the log sometimes

Hello,

Maybe
    \vglue 25 pt
is what you are looking for.
This is "definite" vertical space; it will never disappear.
\vskip is removed in certain contexts,
e.g. in the begin or end of page.

Please check whether this meets your needs:

   \usepackage{amsmath}

   \begin{equation*}
     \setlength{\arraycolsep}{0pt}
     \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.25}
     \begin{array}{r@{\;}c@{\;}r@{\;}}
       x+y+2    & = & 1\\
       2x+3y-4z & = & 2\\

A couple of comments:

1. the alignment of the third column ought to be with "l" (not "r");
2. if, e.g., the r.h.s. of one of the first two equations is longer (say,
1+p) then the output looks a little odd since the box is always as wide as
the table and not a given entry (the same is also true w.r.t. the l.h.s.).

Cheers,  Phil

Thanks for your help.  I'll explain my problem: I have the following macro:


\def\subchapter#1{%
  \vskip0pt plus.3\vsize\vskip0pt plus-.3\vsize
  \bigskip\bigskip\vskip\parskip
  \leftline{#1}
  \vskip0pt plus.3\vsize\vskip0pt plus-.3\vsize
  \bigskip\vskip\parskip
  \par\nobreak\noindent\ignorespaces
     \vtop to 0pt
     \bgroup
     \vskip -25pt
     <some stuff>
     \vss
     \egroup
  \ignorespaces
}


Now, what I noticed is that the \vskip that I set to -25pt slightly varies, in
the output, from place to place.

Why does this happen, and what should put instead to prevent that lenght to
change?

Thanks again
Rodolfo

But of course DEK realised after the birth
of TeX that \vglue at top-of-page did not
contribute the desired amount and was therefore
forced to include \topglue ...

Subject: [texhax] listings.sty question: how to implement single-spacing
Message-ID: <20090616154149.GA20719@lapse.rw.madduck.net>

Hey folks,

I am using the wonderful listings.sty to typeset my code listings
for my thesis. Since I am using (have to use) double-spacing for the
flow text, I'd like to ensure single-spacing for listings to
conserve space, and because it actually increases the readability.

My attempts thus far have been foiled. The following does not work,
even though I can happily define the new environment with with
\lstnewenvironment if I don't try to use the singlespace environment
in its "constructor" and "destructor":

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{listings,setspace}
  \lstnewenvironment{mylisting}
  {\begin{singlespace}\lstset{language=pascal}}
  {\end{singlespace}}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{mylisting}
  for i:=maxint to 0 do
  begin
  { do nothing }
  end;
  \end{mylisting}
  \end{document}

This gives me:

  % latex l.tex
  This is pdfTeXk, Version 3.141592-1.40.3 (Web2C 7.5.6)
  [...]
  Package: `setspace' 6.7 <2000/12/01>
  ) (./l.aux) (/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/listings/lstlang1.sty)
  (/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/base/omscmr.fd))
  *
   ^--- cursor just stays here and I am in TeX command mode

Do you have any idea how to make it do what I want? How can
I typeset visually-appealing listings (with frames across multiple
pages, labels and captions, I don't care so much about syntax
highlighting) in singly-spaced?

Thanks,

Thank you. Didn't think of these contingencies when I shot off the first 
solution that came to my mind. Anyway here's an entirely new attempt, this 
time using PostScript:

\usepackage{pstricks}

\newlength{\eqwd}
\newlength{\eqht}
\newlength{\eqdp}

\newcommand{\mkeqbx}[1]{%
   \settowidth{\eqwd}{$#1$}
   \settoheight{\eqht}{$#1$}
   \settodepth{\eqdp}{$#1$}
    \addtolength{\eqwd}{2pt}
    \addtolength{\eqht}{2pt}
    \addtolength{\eqdp}{2pt}
    \psframe(-2pt,-\eqdp)(\eqwd,\eqht)}


  \begin{align*}
     x+y+2    & = 1\\
     2x+3y-4z & = 2\\
     \mkeqbx{3x-2y+z=3}%
     3x-2y+z  & =3\\
     \mkeqbx{a=b+c+d}%
     a & = b+c+d\\
   \end{align*}

Yes, thanks.  E. Krishnan referred to the same thing and that's what I
ended up using.

It is also referred to in the relevant FAQ entry,
<http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=verbwithin>, as Martin
Schroder referred to with "RTFAQ, please."  I unfortunately lost that
email and can't reply directly to it but, "Ack, yes, sorry".  I searched
but didn't find that, probably a/c of looking for for LaTeX FAQs but not
TeX FAQs.

I saw \verb before posting but since I'm doing multiline code listings
it wouldn't handle my needs.

Thanks all for the help,

P.S.  Are you aware your email client is not maintaining threading when
replying?  It causes your replies to appear "out of thread" in the ar-
chive.  For example this thread is at
<http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2009-June/thread.html#12646> and the
replies from Tom S, Martin S and E. Krishnan appear threaded but yours
appears as a new, separate thread.  My MUA (mutt) handles it better but
still indicates a break in the thread (that doesn't really exist).
    Just FYI...not a big deal but maybe worth fixing if practical.

Phil: 
   Thanks for the note. Shortly after I posted my comments about
Krishnan's
code, I tried to add a further boxed equation of different length, a = b
+ c + d. The boxes, and the other unboxed equations don't behave well at
all. Even with your suggestion, the behavior is not good.

   Your code is robust, even when more then one boxed equation is used.
I noticed though, that trying to change the size of the box with
\fboxsep created some problems. It would be nice the have some option to
be able to change the size of the box, without interfering with the
alignment.

Sebastian.

Thanks, Krishnan, it works fine. Can it be made to work directly with
pdflatex? Right now, we'll have to get the .ps and then convert to pdf.
Not a big problem, but it would be nice, especially if one is using tikz
and pgf.

Message-ID: <1245134699.29198.1320589419@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Does anyone know of a macro in (AMS)LaTeX that has the symbol for nPr?

I understand that \binom{n}{r} and its variants, but there seems to be 
nothing for nPr.

The manual (and perhaps clumsy) way I've been using is

$^n P_r$

Many thanks,

Good day,
   I want to signal an error with latex. Using the documentclass 'article' the Greek letter '\chi' in a mathematical environment results wrong, too high over the orizontal line. This error is corrected with the documentclass 'amsart'.

Best regards,

Hi

Its my first time with Latex, and everything is great about Latex.

I am writing my thesis using a thesis template.

But I have problem in two issues

First how to increase font of the thesis text and line spacing  ?????

The other is I would like to use nice fonts like Times New Roman for
my thesis.

How can I do that ??


Many thanks for your help.

No, I don't think there is such a macro.

You can use the tensor package to get better spacing and alignment:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tensor}
\newcommand\Perms[2]{\tensor[^{#2}]P{_{#1}}}
\begin{document}
$\Perms{n}{r}$
\end{document}

See the lshort.pdf in

Probably you already have it in your distribution. Also, some of the  
best tutorials you can find are from India's TeX User Group:

I like the txfonts, but others use mathptmx; so,

\usepackage{mathptmx}   or   \usepackage{txfonts}

You'll see that in lshort.pdf.

Thanks for the information -- what can I do about it? 

Until last year I used Eudora on a PC, now I prefer using the online mail program from web.de. Don't other posters here use it as well? 

Curious, 

    Uwe.

Actually, he referred to fancyvrb. I suggested \savebox/\usebox instead because I reasoned that \raisebox is not reasonable with multiline content.

I wonder whether posters really should be asked to RTFAQ. 
The UK FAQ is often nice to read, but finding something specific may be difficult. 
I have no better idea to enter "verbatim box" in this case, but you will not find "label=verwithin" this way soon. 
And in this special case you then still have to read a lot about the varieties of the problem until you find the solution for your special problem. 

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

There is no need to use an environment. Use the command:

\documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{listings,setspace}
  \doublespacing %for test
  \lstnewenvironment{mylisting}
  {\singlespacing\lstset{language=pascal}}
  {}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{mylisting}
  for i:=maxint to 0 do
  begin
  { do nothing }
  end;
  \end{mylisting}

Subject: [texhax] typesetting of a critical text editiom
Message-ID: <1123360534@web.de>

hi, 

it is me again with the same problem and another one. The publisher want to have this special paired footnotes and facing pages here is on the one side the source and on the other side the translation. I thought I can manage these problems with the bigfoot.sty and parallel.sty but and the author of the bigfoot.sty said to he will add the solution of this problem to the documentation. But the parallel.sty do not work together with bigfoot.sty, so I have to find another way to solve the problems. 

So now my questions: 

Is anybody there how answered questions to ledpar?
Respectivly is it possible to make paired footnotes with ledpar?
Or another idea. Is it possible to define a footnotecounter, which looks like this in the footnoteapparatus a-a, b-b, c-c, and so on but which looks in the text like a normal footnote and i count the normal footnotecounter and this defined footnotecounter manually.

The odd page have  to look like this:
----------------------------
|
|
|
| te'[xt text text]' text
| text'' text text text
| text [te'''xt text text'''
| text]
|
| footnoteapparatus
| '-' explanation
| '' explanation
| '''-''' explanation
|
----------------------------
': stands for a letter or number

The even page have  to look like this:
----------------------------
|
|
|
| tra*[nslation ]* trans
| lation** translation tra
| nslation [***translation***
| tran] slation
|
| footnoteapparatus
| *-* explanation
| ** explanation
| ***-*** explanation
|
----------------------------

* another footnoteapparatus

Thanks again for your help

Hello,

We have created LaTeX templates for our journal. These were posted on our website a couple of days ago but an author has already spotted a problem. I do not understand LaTeX, would you be able to tell me how to fix the problem? I add the message below and the templates can be downloaded from here
http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/nar/for_authors/msprep_submission.html under the first heading.

Author message: I have downloaded your latex template from your webpage, tried to compile it but it does not work. It gives an error with the crop package saying the 'b4center' is not provided. I have downloaded the crop package but it does not fix it. I am working under Windows XP. Would you know how to fix this?

Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Best wishes,
Martine

Your code contains the lines 

\DeclareOption{b4center}{\PassOptionsToPackage{b4center}{crop}}
\DeclareOption{a4center}{\PassOptionsToPackage{a4center}{crop}}

But crop doesn't know this options. But it knows a4 and center so
you probably meant (untested):

\DeclareOption{b4center}{\PassOptionsToPackage{b4,center}{crop}}
\DeclareOption{a4center}{\PassOptionsToPackage{a4,center}{crop}}

Thanks for all replies, although I actually did not
get a suitable answer.

To restate: I don't want to extract LaTeX commands
from a text/html/tex file for post-processing. I want to 
extract EPS of individual equations from a multipage 
EPS. 

For reference, here is what I found:

The dvips tool has a useful -pp option, which allows
the user to specify a page (or range of pages) to 
convert. Together with -E (for EPS), this will do what
I need, as long as I put each equation onto a separate
page.

It seems to me that there is a gap here for a package
that handles all of this in one fell swoop, ideally in such
a way that I can specify the filenames of the resulting
single-equation EPS files right there in the LaTeX file.

The rationale for all of this is that I am writing a 
manuscript for PRINT publishing in DocBook, which
means that I have to submit all serious math as 
scalable graphics. I would guess others have been
through the same loop before. (Isn't it wonderful how 
publishing technology has progressed in the last
30 years.)

Thanks again.

Best,

		Ph.

[If we're to discuss this any further we should probably take it private
 a/c it's off-topic for the TeX maillists...]

I'm no email expert, but looking at the headers from the replies I re-
ceived the others contain "References:" and "In-reply-to:" headers (see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email>) but yours does not, and I think
that's the problem.  The normal answer would probably to change your MUA
(email client) configuration, or change MUAs if your current one is
incapable of generating the proper headers.  I'm not familiar w/ web.de
but assuming it's a web-based email service like GMail then probably all
you can do is ask them to change (I'd argue, "fix") its behavior.

Funny, unlike the English Wikipedia, the German Wikipedia on 
"Encapsulated PostScript" tells that "multipage EPS" is a contradiction.

That's probably right. Let me rephrase:

"I want to extract EPS of individual equations from

How about this?

   \usepackage{calc}

   \newlength{\eqwd}
   \newlength{\eqht}
   \newlength{\eqdp}
   \newlength{\shift}

   \newcommand{\mkeqbx}[1]{%

It is slightly better to have

\newcommand{\mkeqbx}[1]{%
   \settowidth{\eqwd}{$#1$}%
   \settoheight{\eqht}{$#1$}%
   \settodepth{\eqdp}{$#1$}%
   \setlength{\shift}{-\eqwd-\fboxsep}   %%%%%%% default \fboxsep=3pt
   \hspace{\shift}%
   \framebox{\rule[-\eqdp]{0pt}{\eqht+\eqdp}\hphantom{$#1$}}}

I want to write document using different fonts like Calligraphic font.

A font package is available at
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/fundus.html

But How can I install and use it ??

Can anybody please tell me the step by step method to install and use these
(and other new fonts)

Dear texhax,

I learned about your email address from Gerree Pecht, who is an
avid TeX user and probably a member of the TeX User's Group.  I
have a TeX problem that I can't solve.

I have written a math research monograph for Princeton Press.
The monograph has 1 appendix.  This appendix is called

Appendix A

The various statements in Appendix A appear as

Section A.1
Theorem A.2
Figure A.5
etc.

The header (across the right hand pages) reads
Appendix A.

All of this works perfectly, except for one problem.  The
editor does not want us to call the appendix Appendix A
because there is no Appendix B and "Appendix A" might look
like an error to some observers.

The editor would like to switch this to the following:
The appendix should be called

Appendix    (I know how to fix this)

The statements within the appendix should remain

Section A.1
etc.

The header should change to

Appendix

That is, the A should be removed.  This is the problem I do
not know how to fix.   I have two questions, one that is important
and one that is just for my own curiousity.

1. How do you fix my problem?

2. Why would LaTeX arrange things so that a book with just one
appendix would have that appendix be called "Appendix A"?  Or,
do the writers of LaTeX think that a single appendix called
"Appendix A" is actually the most correct setup?  (I don't mind
"Appendix A" personally.)

Thanks for any help you can give.

Best,
Rich Schwartz

It sounds like you only need to fix the header.  Look up the
documentation about the \leftmark and \rightmark and just set them
appropriately.  I'd be more specific, but it kind of depends on which
packages you're using, which you didn't mention.

rich,

    I have written a math research monograph for Princeton Press.
    The monograph has 1 appendix.  This appendix is called

    Appendix A

    The various statements in Appendix A appear as

    Section A.1
    Theorem A.2
    Figure A.5
    etc.

    [...]

    1. How do you fix my problem?

you don't say what document class you're
using, but if it happens to be based on
amsbook, the answer is described in detail
in the ams author faq:

  http://www.ams.org/authors/author-faq.html#oneappendix

if you're using some other document class,
it's likely that at least some of this
information will be helpful.
    
    2. Why would LaTeX arrange things so that a book with just one
    appendix would have that appendix be called "Appendix A"?  Or,
    do the writers of LaTeX think that a single appendix called
    "Appendix A" is actually the most correct setup?  (I don't mind
    "Appendix A" personally.)

not being a member of the latex team, i
can't give an authoritative answer, but
conjecture that it's much easier to reset
what's necessary when only one appendix
is involved than it is to construct the
mechanism for multiple indexes.

good luck.

Phil:

   I have solved the problem. My mailer seems to have introduced the
characters 3D in lots of places. I removed them and the code works.

   It works like a charm. It works under pdflatex as well. I tried
alignedboxsep as 10 pt, and it works fine.

   Thanks very much.

    Thank you very much. It works beautifully. I changed fboxsep and the
alignment is maintained. And, it works with pdflatex.

Phil: 

  I am having some problem getting your code to work. i am using
texlive, the latest version. I am unfamiliar with the 3D format you are
using for lengths. I presume this stands for the space occupied by "3D"?
Whatever it is, here is the error message I get:

ERROR: Illegal unit of measure (pt inserted).

--- TeX said ---
<to be read again> 
                   D
l.13 \alignboxedsep=3D1
                       pt
--- HELP ---
If you just got a

      ! Missing number, treated as zero.

error, then this is part of the same problem.  If not, it means that
LaTeX was expecting a length as an argument and found a number
instead.  The most common cause of this error is writing 0 instead of
something like 0in for a length of zero, in which case typing return
should result in correct output. However, the error can also be caused
by omitting a command argument.

Just in case my mailer mangled the code, here is what I am using:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\def\alignboxed#1&#2\endalignboxed{%
  \bgroup
  \fboxsep=3D\alignboxedsep
  \rlap{\boxed{#1#2}}\hphantom{#1\kern\fboxsep}
  \egroup
}
\newlength{\alignboxedsep}
\alignboxedsep=3D1pt
\begin{document}
\begin{align}
  f_1(x) &=3D a+bx,
\\
  \alignboxed
  f_2(x) &=3D a+bx+cx=B2,
  \endalignboxed
\\
  \alignboxed
  f_3(x) &=3D a+bx+cx=B2+dx=B3.
  \endalignboxed
\end{align}
\begin{align*}
  x+y+2    & =3D 1
\\
  2x+3y-4z & =3D 2
\\
  \alignboxed
  3x-2y+z  & =3D3
  \endalignboxed
\\
  \alignboxed
  a & =3D b+c+d
  \endalignboxed
\end{align*}
\end{document}
I will experiment to see whether I can solve it on my own. Since you
have tested it, I presume my mailer introduced some character. I'll try
and track it down. Thanks.

Sebastian

Does it not work "as is" under LaTeX?

Anyway, here are a couple of packages that I've developed over the years (and do actually use pretty regularly), which I could upload to CTAN (and maintain properly) if there were sufficient interest.

As the name suggests, foreign.sty  does rather more than just define abbreviations and it's  xpuncuate.sty that actually handles the following periods, commas etc.

Cheers,  Phil

I think what you want is provided by the array package; see the LaTeX  
Primer by India's TUG:

http://sarovar.org/frs/?group_id=48&release_id=105

especially p. 70 (but read the whole section VII.2 Tables: it covers  
multirow as well).

I don't know much of these things, only were busy with parsing .eps with TeX as in the graphics package ... 

.. but this looks like throwing the logical information away and then trying to retrieve it from the glyph placement information, so seems not so sound ... 

The `extract' package -- www.ctan.org/pkg/extract -- seems to address extracting information directly from the LaTeX commands. I cannot judge right now whether it is developped enough right now to handle your task immediately.

My previous idea more specific, without regarding actual facilities of the extract package: 

redefine the equation environment (resp. others) so it: 

1. writes a file whose <filename> contains the equation number (ususually just expansion of \theequation) and whose content is 

    \documentclass ... \begin{document}
    $$<equation content>\eqno<expansion of \theequation>$$
    \end{document}

2. adds `latex <filename>' to a batch file (or/plus something producing the .eps version if you really need it)

... clearer? 

HTH ... Uwe.

Another way of looking at it ( perhaps an all-too-obvious Unix way) is 
to avoid forcing system A to do what is much better done by system B.  
When I have something that is an obvious case for emacs, I use emacs.  I 
do not try to get TeX macros to simulate emacs.  When Perl seems the 
right choice, I use Perl.  For facing translations, I set  verso pages 
in one file, using an increment of 2 for pagination, and recto pages in 
a separate file.  I can then do fine control of page ends with two 
instances of xdvi.  To blend the two files, I use dviselect and 
dviconcat, driven by a fairly simple bash script. 

The argument against this chain of programs is the one that Microsoft 
constantly blares, that every utility should do everything, including 
combing one's hair, in one massively complex slushy effort, no matter 
how inappropriate or incompatible various parts of the  the task are. 

The argument for the chain of programs is that each utility is doing 
what it does best, cleanly, and in a way that can easily be traced if 
anything goes wrong.  The Microsoft black-box solution, cramming every 
task into the same gargantuan utility, no matter how inappropriate, 
produces constant frustration, because the resultant programs become so 
complex that even their authors can't trace the errors.  I just don't 
think that it is a wise use of resources to try to make TeX pretend that 
it is Bash, or Perl, or emacs.  Someone once did a passable Basic 
interpreter with TeX macros, but I don't think he ever claimed that it 
should be used in place of Basic, if that was what you needed.

Thanks for your answer, but it is entirely missing 
the point.

I don't want to extract "information", because there is
no receiver for this "information". I am trying to extract
a PICTURE (a "blob"), so that I can give that to a real,
dead-trees and ink publisher, who can then glue that
picture into the printed book without interpreting it any
further, so that (hopefully) my READERS can extract 
information from it.

In other words, it is crucial to me that LaTeX has already
done its magic and processed the commands into 
something that no longer needs to be interpreted by a
machine (only by a human reader). 

What I was looking for were some creature comforts
managing the potentially hundreds of files that this
will require. (And here we get into finer points, whether
it is simpler to have one large LaTeX file, which then
needs to be split to get the individual equation images,
or should there be a separate LaTeX document for
each equation, etc. THAT'S what my original question 
was all about.)

This may all be very hard to understand if you are
very used to LaTeX. Most other publishing environments
are still (2009) absolutely and unbelievably brain-dead 
compared to LaTeX, but that's the world we live in.

In any case, I suggest we end this thread. I think it
has exhausted its usefulness.

Best,

		Ph.

Subject: [texhax] Chemical reactions in Latex
Message-ID: <9e7ec6310906200040q8c8a9c0mbe4bc1c782227540@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,

I am writing my thesis in Latex, and I have lot of equation.

But along with this I have several chemical reactions and I want to use
different numbering system for the chemical reactions.

For an example my first equation is

\begin{subequations}
\label{1st_equ}
\begin{align}
\dot{X} &= P+Q \\
\dot{Y} &= Q^2 \\
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

After that I am writing the chemical reactions

\begin{subequations}
\label{1st_reaction}
\begin{align}
  A+B &\rightarrow  C \\
  C+D &\rightarrow  A+E \\
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

In the output the reactions are numbered as continuation of equation, But I
want to give reactions a different numbering.

I have tried to use   \tag{number} and he  mhchem Bundle for chemical
reactions too. In case of \tag{number} I have to keep track of all reaction
numbers and give reaction number manually and in mhchem bundle have no such
function.

Is there any way out ??

Thanks

I know some people who worried about parallel typesetting for translations 
and am distributing Pierre MacKay's[1] advice among them. I am focussing 
here on the practical aspect of how you could obtain the "parallel" feature.

Apart from dviselect[2] dviconcat[3] There also is dvitodvi.[4] Some may 
need to know that xdvi is a UNIX previewer and that the same can be done 
with YAP etc.

After some thinking it seems to me that this method isn't just a 
workaround, but the preferable way. This way you move manual page breaks, 
otherwise you must move text around in the file.

An aspect somewhat intermediate between the practical and philosophical one 
is that some workers *do not know* how to use dviselect and dviconcat and 
bash -- e.g., sitting at their PC or notebook equipped with Windows.

However, they could ask an IT group for the humanities or at the math or 
physics department of their university. Either somebody skilled does the 
dvi things, or you can get Windows versions of these utilities. (?)

I even know some who stick to DOS -- not so bad! -- they might learn that 
Linux -- bash! -- is smarter -- and you get better support for utilities 
and programs for Linux! This is about what Pierre MacKay indicates in the 
more philosophical passages of his posting:

I go on in a second posting, because some people who get the present one 
certainly don't want to see the rest.

Indeed Uwe Lueck constantly blares that TeX should do everything! 
"Microsoft" may (like, e.g., "the poster") be a polite expression for 
people like me who hope that everything could be done with TeX, cf.:

>I just don't think that it is a wise use of resources to try to make TeX

In a different thread I already posted

     http://sdh33b.blogspot.com/2008/07/icfp-contest-2008.html

on programming a Mars rover controller with TeX.

>Someone once did a passable Basic interpreter with TeX macros, but I don't

This refers to

     BaSiX (with the emphasis on SICK!) by Andrew Marc Greene

in basix.tex on

     http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/generic/basix/

TeX forever!

     Uwe Lueck.

P.S.: To contribute something serious, I am trying to summarize arguments 
held elsewhere: The philosophy of the docstrip program: A TeX user may have 
difficulties with some variety of software, either with installing or with 
understanding, or both. And especially a student working at a thesis that 
is a critical text edition may know little on UNIX tools. We can assume 
that she has a working TeX installation, so just use this program, not 
another one. And she has to learn something about TeX and LaTeX anyway, so 
build on this knowledge and practice in reading LaTeX instructions.

Even portability may be better this way since some other utilities are 
called by the same command but work very differently on different 
installations.

But Pierre MacKay is quite right if

>The Microsoft black-box solution, cramming every task into the same 
>gargantuan utility, no matter how inappropriate, produces constant 
>frustration, because the resultant programs become so complex that even 
>their authors can't trace the errors.

is interpreted to address implementing features of UNIX utilities in TeX.

On the other hand, a TeX user must learn to live with constant frustration 
regarding some TeX packages anyway ...

Cheers,

     Uwe.

If you "don't want" extract information, you though *must* (I think), namely:

I did not refer to the information an *equation contains*, but the 
information on *what is an equation.* A human reader can easily discern 
equations on the paper or on screen, but you certainly want to have 
*software* that discerns equations. In your .tex files, you clearly mark 
equations, but this "information" gets "blurred" in the output.

If you are saying that LaTeX should not be involved in producing another 
instance of one equation, you shouldn't (cf. TeXbook p. 228). And it seems 
you *do* want that after typesetting a *machine* should generate the single 
equation files, not a human reader.

So you have these hundreds of files and a single batch file that continues 
processing all of them.

But meanwhile I think that a single "extract" file produced by LaTeX may 
suffice. It may just *typeset* something like

     STARTEQUATIONBOUNDINGBOX<dimensions>
     <content>`
     ENDEQUATION

so the "information" for discerning equations is in the PostScript file and 
another utility can reliably put <content> into a separate file with head 
and end as needed for .eps and the BOUNDINGBOX line made from <dimensions> ...

... however, this was one idea, and now I think it suffices to have *one* 
second output file with *one* equation on each (otherwise blank) page.

Cheers,

     Uwe.

It seems to me an excellent solution. I wish I implemented it in my  
recent two critical editions... (Instead I was combining the source  
code fromt two latex files into one single .tex file with a very  
simple perl script... which means typsetting the whole document at  
least ten times for every single page break... months of sitting in  
front of the computer...)

Does anyone know of a terminal utility for Mac that splits pdfs into  
single pages and then recombines the files again to a single  
document? This way typestting synoptical critical  editions with  
ednotes would become really an enjoyable task!

I've just published a critical edition with facing translation (using
plain xetex with edmac and eplain). As Pierre suggested, I used a
separate file for my translation, and manually split up my translation
pages and interleaved them as individual PDF pages. It was a fast and
painless process. I used pdftk (on the command line with Mac OS X) to
split the files into individual pdf pages, and I used the built in Mac
system utility (/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF
Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py) to reconcatenate after
inserting the translation pages.

Hello all:

I'm all but done with preparing a book manuscript, and when I try to put
\LaTeX on the credits page, it gives me an error: "Use of \@ doesn't
match its definition."

Apart from helping me appreciate the irony of the situation, I wonder if
anyone has some advice.  I'm using the memoir class, and the preamble
looks like this:

\documentclass[10pt,twoside,openright]{memoir}
\usepackage{pifont}
\usepackage{palatino}
\usepackage{lettrine}
\usepackage{xspace}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{wrapfig}

Any thoughts?

Thanks,

That's weird. Something must come after that part of your preamble and  
your use of the command \LaTeX, because I have no problems with this:

\documentclass[10pt,twoside,openright]{memoir}
\usepackage{pifont}

Thanks to \LaTeX\ I could typeset this ---well, it was really \LaTeXe,  
but you already know that.

There were suggestions for this, because lots of perple have
had the need to extract equations as graphics images.  I mentioned 
the preview package; I don't know if it is easy to make it 
stop with eps files.

It is really easy to cook up yet another solution if need be, but
there are alreasy many solutions for this faq.

Try a google groups search like 
extract equations as eps group:comp.text.tex

Yes, there is.  Simply hack the equation environment and define a new
chemeqn environment ...
Normally in a thesis you want to refer to reaction (x) and you rarely
need chapter reference as in equation (3.2), that is,  the second eqn in
chapter 2 .... that is one big advantage of separating mathematical and
chemical equations

Hi to all,

I am writing my thesis in Latex, and I have lot of equation.

But along with this I have several chemical reactions and I want to use
different numbering system for the chemical reactions.

For an example my first equation is

\begin{subequations}
\label{1st_equ}
\begin{align}
\dot{X} &= P+Q \\
\dot{Y} &= Q^2 \\
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

After that I am writing the chemical reactions

\begin{subequations}
\label{1st_reaction}
\begin{align}
  A+B &\rightarrow  C \\
  C+D &\rightarrow  A+E \\
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

In the output the reactions are numbered as continuation of equation,
But I
want to give reactions a different numbering.

I have tried to use   \tag{number} and he  mhchem Bundle for chemical
reactions too. In case of \tag{number} I have to keep track of all
reaction
numbers and give reaction number manually and in mhchem bundle have no
such
function.

Is there any way out ??

Thanks

Don't do it. Use another name for your command.

Just to explain the point: \the is part and parcel of TeX and will certainly
be used by many packages and even by LaTeX itself,
Here's an example:

\edef\today{%
  \the\year/\two at digits{\the\month}/\two at digits{\the\day}:%
    \two at digits{\the\count@}:\two at digits{\the\count2}}

It's always much much safer to use new and different names unless you really
want to interfere with LaTeX's workings and then only if you really really
know what you're doing.

Cheers,  Phil

The situation is typical for trying to redefine a LaTeX internal outside a 
package or class without \makeatletter. E.g., "\def\@tempa..." renders \@ a 
macro expecting "tempa".

I started working with LaTeX by creating a "definition" environment called 
"def" ... (almost)

Apart from this, it seems to me that Wawan is asking for an explanation of 
\renewcommand ... !?

Subject: [texhax] `\vtop to 0pt' produces a vertical shift: is that normal?
Message-ID: <87zlc1oa4c.fsf@gmail.com>

With plain TeX: if I put a `\vtop to 0pt{}' after a `\par' command, that
produces a vertical shift, whereas one would expect a vertical box of height
zero to not produce any visible vertical effect at all.

Why does this happen, and how to work it out?

Thanks for any help

That's funny.  It turned out that I had an errant @ not enclosed by
\makeatletter and \makeatother a dozen lines above the apparent source
of the problem.  It had been working fine until I added the \LaTeX
command.  Curious, but it works now.  Are you suggesting I was
inadvertently redefining \@?

Thank you for the advice.

No, there is no practical way.  You would have to go through all of LaTeX
and any packages you use and change every use of "\the" to some
replacement name.  (Another prime example of a raw TeX command name
interference is "\box".)

Yup. It is very easy to do. Without \makeatletter before it, the definition
  \def\@whatever #1{foo bar #1}
will then define \@ as a control symbol which must be followed by the
letters "whatever" before reading its single argument. Since that is
rarely the case, you get the error message that
  "Use of \@ doesn't match its definition."
as soon you execute something using \@ such as \LaTeX (well, the \TeX
command at its end).

I found the word I needed---space factor.  To rephrase the question
above: can I supply a space factor to a macro expecting a dimen?
(Passing {\spacefactor3000} as the argument does not work.)

Failing that, how can I determine the default width of an inter-sentence
space?

I am interested in purchasing the 2008 edition of the CD Rom containing
TeXLive. I do have some questions concerning this purchase. They are:

1). I recently purchased a Dell desktop computer with a 64 bit processor
running 64 bit Vista. Will TeXLive install and work on it?

2). I have a Toshiba laptop with a 32 bit processor and a 32 bit version of
XP Home edition. Will TeXLive install and run on this computer also.

3). Will 2008 TeXLive install directly over the top of my current 2003
installation or will I have to delete my 2003 installation first?

   I would like to install the software on both computers. I am using WinEDt
version 5.5 as my editor.

Remove the older version but keep any special files you may have

No.  

You probably have to do something like 

\newlength\myspc
\settowidth\myspc{\spacefactor3000{ }}

and then use \myspc as the dimension argument.  That won't track 
font size changes though.

Other avenues are dirty hacking into the internals of the 
amsthm macros.

What OS are you using? Just do a internet search for that OS and add the
word LaTeX or TeX (whichever you are using). This should give you some links
to some extremely throughout instructions. It is usually easier to bring a
specific problem to this list. Try installing it first then if you run into
problems ask a question related to that specific problem.

I found most of what I was looking for, except for the bit doesn?t work:

\newlength{\issp}	% default inter-sentence space
\setlength{\issp}{\fontdimen2\font}	% inter-word space
\addtolength{\issp}{\fontdimen7\font}	% extra space

\newlength{\isst}	% inter-sentence stretch
\setlength{\isst}{\fontdimen3\font}	% inter-word stretch
\multiply\isst3		% mimic \spacefactor 3000

\newlength{\issh}	% inter-sentence shrink
\setlength{\issh}{\fontdimen4\font}	% inter-word shrink
\divide\isst3		% mimic \spacefactor 3000

\newlength{\intersentencespace}
%\setlength{\intersentencespace}{\issp plus \isst minus \issh}

The funny thing is, this /does/ work:

\newlength{\iwp}
\setlength{\iwp}{\fontdimen2\font %
	plus \fontdimen3\font minus \fontdimen4\font}

(In fact I could see the difference between using ?{\iwp}? as an
argument to \newtheoremstyle and using ?{ }?, because the stretch was
applied.)

How can I set a rubber length the way I?m trying to?

Answered on comp.text.tex:  Coerce the <skip> values to <dimen> values,
i.e.:
	\setlength{\intersentencespace}{1\issp plus 1\isst minus 1\issh}
or use scratch <dimen> registers.

TeX inserts glue between boxes in vertical list to keep the baselines
equal distance apart.  So your zero-height vbox actually adds non-zero
baseline skip.  You can see this for yourself by running the following
input through TeX and examining the log:

---------------->%----------------
1

\vtop to 0pt{}

2

3

\tracingonline=1
\showboxbreadth=10000
\showlists

\bye
----------------%<----------------

Notice that the baselines are exactly 12pt apart.

> and how to work it out?

You can try this:

---------------->%----------------
\newdimen\savedepth

y

\savedepth=\prevdepth
\nointerlineskip
\vtop to 0pt{}
\prevdepth=\savedepth

2

3

\tracingonline=1
\showboxbreadth=10000
\showlists

\bye
----------------%<----------------

However this kind of trickery is very troublesome.  There will be
issues with spacing/penalties when page break falls around the
injected material.

have you actually cited something?
have you run bibtex?
have you specified bibstyle and bibtex db file in the document?

there is no other way to include it other than as 'pictures', the 
pdfpages package provide a nice interface to include pages from PDF 
files as the background for pages in our document.

A hint from Lars Madsen on "references in tex" makes me guess that the 
pdfpages package,

     http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pdfpages

could be used as well for combining facing pages from different LaTeX runs. 
But I haven't had a closer look at the package, I may be very wrong, or it 
needs an additional trick, sorry ...

This looks fine, congratulations!

You asked about \def earlier, by which you could replace the former with

     \def\ha{{\char10}}

This is shorter, but \newcommand saves you from mistakes -- just to answer 
your earlier question.
You might do

     \newcommand{\NC}{\newcommand}
     \NC{\ha}{{\char}}

etc. to save space, then you could type several definitions in one code line.

I wonder about the extra *braces* in the definitions, this is not my field 
of expertise.
(Hope *real wizards* see this!)
The braces are useful here when another number follows.
But you could use octal or hexadecimal notation,

     \newcommand{\ha}{\char'012}

or

     \newcommand{\ha}{\char"0A}

would overcome the parsing problem I alluded to; it may even be more 
helpful with font tables.

Another possibility is

     \chardef\ha="0F

which, however, doesn't do the check that \newcommand does.
(It is more efficient regarding memory.)

On p. 356 of the TeXbook there are some things with \chardef, some with 
\def, some with extra braces, I don't know why. I find it somewhat 
difficult to find the corresponding things in LaTeX.

What language are you implementing? This might be really interesting.

Best,

     Uwe.

Unless, we do not see your TeX file, we can not say much. But as a general
advice try to scale your tree to fit the page size or if desired try to use
landscape page layout for that specific tree.

vietnam.sty only provides an easy way to typeset Vietnamese and no
attempt had been made to support anything else.

For multilingual documents you should better use babel.sty instead of
vietnam.sty.  There is a new document in the VnTeX distribution which
provides an example.  It's not yet in any TeX distribution but on CTAN.

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/language/vietnamese/vntex/doc/generic/vntex/vntex.pdf

See section 3.1.2 on page 4.  There is also a brief introduction to
encodings on page 2.  I hope that you are using UTF-8 as input
encoding already.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.64.0906261337430.216@bryan-lepores-powerbook-g4-12.local>

[abbrev. pdflatex code below]

i'd like to get a long figure aligned left, then three small figures 
stacked on the right, then table on the bottom.

+--------+---------+
| long   | short 1 |
|        |---------+
| figure | short 2 |
|        |---------+
|        | short 3 |
+--------+---------+
|     table        |
+------------------+

the table position is ok.  i am trying \\ after the figures, but have 
inconsistent results : seems dependent on figure scaling, maybe rotation.


i can keep hammering away, but : is this even possible given the code 
below, or am i hoping for too much with the figure env?

first forget you ever heard of eqnarray, reason see PracTeX Journal

Next learn to use the amsmath envs instead, and then use empheq to frame 
the equations

Subject: [texhax] () instead of [] in bibliography
Message-ID: <9e7ec6310906271244l726ace18wda65f77371ff0dd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Whenever I am citing anything in my tex file, in output I am getting number
inside the *round brackets *() instead of *square brackets* [] .

Is this a problem with the bibliography style that I am using (
\bibliographystyle{plain} )   or the problem is with the style (.cls) file.

For example in my tex document I am citing the research papers as

Some text and then \cite{my_key}

And in the final PDF I am getting

Some text and then (1)

So the problem is that, in the final PDF file the citation number is inside
the (1) but I want as [1] .

What should I do ??

Well, you might start by telling us exactly what .cls you're using together

I am forwarding the message below on behalf of Peter Rosenfeld, Managing

fonts also available under the LPPL.  At his request, I'll be
disseminating the information throughout the TeX community.

Many thanks to Dr. Rosenfeld!

Subject: URW++ original 35 fonts available under LPPL

To whom it may concern,

Many years ago, URW++ Design and Development Inc. released their
Type 1 implementations of the basic 35 PostScript fonts under the
GNU General Public License and the Aladdin Ghostscript Free Public
License.

We now additionally release them under the LaTeX Project Public License
(http://www.latex-project.org/lppl), either version 1 or (at your
option) any later version.

Of course, this additional licensing applies to the original URW++
material, not any subsequent changes and additions made by other
parties.

The original font files are widely available, for instance as part of
the Ghostscript 4.00 release, and therefore we are not releasing any new
font files.  Those interested can replace the license terms in those
original files accordingly.  Responsibility for ensuring that no
material is incorrectly licensed remains with the distributor, as
always.

We hope this additional licensing will make our fonts even more widely
available and usable in the free software community, such as the TeX
Gyre Project.

Sincerely,
Peter Rosenfeld (Managing Director, URW++)

Hi Betty,
no, it's quite easy too.  You have to run install-tl.bat.  And then
click on the [Install TeX Live] button.  If this doesn't work, please
provide more information.  Don't be confused about the many options
which allows you to configure the system.  The default values are fine
and you don't have to change anything (except if you prefer letter
size to A4).

But you can ignore this, you can use the "TeX Live Manager" in order
to configure these things later.  It's sufficient to run the installer
and click on the [Install TeX Live] button.

Please explain what you've done and what happened.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Call for participation: Towards a Digital Mathematics Library (DML 2009)
July 8-9th, 2009, Grand Bend, Ontario, Canada

Workshop webpage: http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/dml-2009.html
Registration: http://www.orcca.on.ca/conferences/cicm09/cicm09/registration.html

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects, 
asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow [CEDRAM model/Euclid])?

Proceedings:
has been published by Masaryk University Press and will be available on site.

which points to this announcement

? ?http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/news/news102.shtml

from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The
Ohio State University of the sudden death of Eitan Gurari on
June 22.

Gurari was known in the discussion here as the author of tex4ht,
a widely used tool for the translation of LaTeX to HTML and
various XML document types.

I always found him to be most helpful. ?We shall miss him.

Subject: [texhax] Is there a way to change how LaTeX handles undefined
	commands?
Message-ID: <ff1904540906292205p2b643d2aw6290e5b11ff23bf9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
  I'd like to be able to change the way LaTeX hanldes undefined
commands in a particular document, preferably from within the document
itself but something that works as a command line argument would be
fine too.  In particular, I hope to do the following: suppress the
error that comes from the undefined command, print the command
verbatim in the output document (ie \badcommand would be printed in
the dvi file with a leading backslash as "\badcommand"), and put an
additional mark in the margin on the same line as the undefined
command.  I realize that this would be pretty strange, but I'm hoping
that it will speed things up when I'm composing the initial drafts of
a paper.  Is it possible to change the error/exception handling within
TeX and LaTeX like this and, if it is, what would be a good source of
documentation to start with?

I'm using TeX Live on Debian, if that makes a difference to the
answer.  My apologies if this is not the correct mailing list for this
question.  Thanks in advance!

Subject: [texhax] fatal errors with footnote italics for critical edition

For a critical edition (Mac OS, ledmac, TeXShop, all latest versions) with double 
footnotes, my B footnotes are vulnerable to random "fatal errors" when text is 
italicized.  These fatal errors tend to happen when B footnotes follow A 
footnotes, or when B footnotes reach some kind of length or formatting limit.  
The error disappears when the italicization is removed.

Error first, preamble next.  Both \textit and my macro \I generate the same 
error.    Other macros: \edt = \edtext  \A = Afootnote  \B = Bfootnote

\edt{ananas}{\A{\I{Ananasses} F; Anana's H}}{\B{pineapples (Fr. \I{ananas})}}, 
\edt{which to my taste}{\A{\sout{I} to H; which, to my taste, F}}

Some workarounds seem to help - pasting in B footnotes first, nesting B 
footnotes within the lemma, adding \newcommands that embed the italics in 
the text.  But no workaround works around consistently, or helps me 
understand why italics create fatal errors at all.

Grateful in advance for any help, and for patience with a learning user in 
humanities.

You want to have line numbers on the left of the lefthand column and on the right of the righthand column, right? This is achieved by package option `switch'. What is the problem?

Eitan was really very helpful person and nice person who always
answered to cry for help.

 I hope that TeXLive 2009 will include the latest releases of tex4ht

I cannot afford analyzing this in detail right now, but the footnote commands must be in the second argument of \edtext=\edt, while here it ends before \B, it looks as if \B were in a third argument of \edt, but it simply is a footnote command in some braces group somewhere in the main text. You may avoid a "fatal error" dropping italicization, but I expect that something strange will happen even then, as long as you don't obey the proper syntax.

Subject: [texhax] Cleveref bug with primed equations
Message-ID: <4A4A7228.1080607@gmail.com>

Here?s a simple example of what I?m trying to do:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{cleveref}

\begin{document}
\section*{Demonstrate Bug}
Here is an equation:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:pyth}
	a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
\end{equation}

Here is the equation, solved for $c$:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:pythsolve}
	\tag{\ref{eq:pyth}${}'$}
	c=\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
\end{equation}

This reference works: \cref{eq:pyth},
as does this one: \eqref{eq:pyth}.

%This reference fails: \cref{eq:pythsolve}.
%This one too: \eqref{eq:pythsolve}.
%Even this one: (\ref{eq:pythsolve}).
\end{document}

Uncommenting the \cref line leads to an error of the sort:

	! Argument of \cref at refstar has an extra }.
	<inserted text>
	                \par
	l.27 This reference fails: \cref{eq:pythsolve}

Uncommenting either of the other lines yields this error:

	! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack size=5000].
	\reserved at a ->\def \reserved at a
	                               *{\cref at refstar }\reserved at a
	l.29 Even this one: (\ref{eq:pythsolve}
                                       ).
	If you really absolutely need more capacity,
	you can ask a wizard to enlarge me.

According to my .log, I?m using ?cleveref 2009/17/04 v0.13?, the latest
on CTAN.
