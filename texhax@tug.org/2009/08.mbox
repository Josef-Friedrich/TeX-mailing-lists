I will try the primer, but so far, adding the \htmladnormallink caused 
only error messages no matter where I put it.  Without it, the links 
stayed dead.  I will play with the primer and see what I can do.

The Adobe reader is doing it, it makes links from text that looks
like an URL. You can disable it in somewhere in the options (tab
general, "make links from url" or something like that).

hyperref is pretty standard. Have you tried deleting all the aux files 
and compile again, that usually solves the initial hyperref problems.

An update on this.  I have hacked around with combnat.sty in a
brute-force manner and found that if I comment out line 341 it works,
although not for the case where there's more than one citation in the
brackets (fortunately I don't have too many of these so I can
manually rewrite them). It doesn't look like combnat.sty has been
changed for a while, so I would imagine people have the same version,
but just in case the context of 341 is:

339	       \if\relax\NAT at date\relax\def\@citea{\NAT at sep\ }%
340	       \else
341	         \def\@citea{\NAT@@close\NAT at sep\ }
342	       \fi

I doubt the cause of this problem is this line itself - I would
guess it's something to do with the general treatment of multiple
citations, which need separation and a space between years, not being
modified properly for the case of single citations.  I tried comparing
with the equivalent code in natbib.sty but nothing jumped out.

This is only an ugly hack, rather than a solution, of course, but it is
sufficient for my purposes now and I hope that this (a) helps someone
cleverer than me to find where the problem is, or (b) helps someone who
comes across this problem in future to get round it.

After a private exchange with Lars Madsen over my question, in which he 
asked me to post a minimal example, here it is.

I am using Miktex, v. 2.7 on a Win XP machine, using whatever version of 
dvipdfm that came with that installation (from a TeX-Live DVD).

A minimal example:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{html}

\begin{document}

\begin{thebibliography}{}

\bibitem[Barr (1998)]{sepext} M. Barr, The separated extensional Chu
category (1998).  127--137.
\htmladdnormallink
{ftp://ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr/pdffiles/bbr.pdf}
{ftp://ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr/pdffiles/bbr.pdf}

\end{thebibliography}

Incidentaly, I tried changing ftp:// to http://, but the results were the 
same--no live links.

As I said, running the dvipdfm produced many error messages.  Here is a small 
sample:

Ignoring remaining special text following unknown PS operator: "SDict"

Remainder of line unparsed.
Current input buffer is -->begin [ /Producer (dvips + Distiller) /Title () /S.

<--

Unrecognized special ignored
Current input buffer is -->! /DvipsToPDF{72.27 mul Resolution div} def/PDFToD.

<--

Ignoring remaining special text following unknown PS operator: "SDict"

Remainder of line unparsed.
Current input buffer is -->begin /product where{pop product(Distiller)search{.

<--

and many, many more like that.

It seems to me that you are speaking of ligatures. They must be declared in 
the metafont source, I think. I do not know about virtual fonts which may 
be an alternative.

It seems to me that you are speaking of ligatures. They must be declared in 
the metafont source, I think. I do not know about virtual fonts which may 
be an alternative. 

Virtual font are indeed the answer. Combined with the extended ligaturing formulae in PL and TFM, they can do an astonishing job of creating composite characters, though I have never tried to emulate DEK's special trick of allowing the dissolution of ligatures for line breaking. This would be a good way of reintroducing the typesetting refinements from the U+Exxx pages of Unicode into text. 

Ligaturing through the TFM mechanisms is how the post-positive accentuation of Ibycus is managed.

Michael,

For what it's worth, I tried your minimal example on my linux system
(texlive2008) - the html.sty is html.sty,v 1.39 2001/10/01 which is what
came with my linux distribution I think.

I tried various things:

pdflatex
latex + kdvi viewer
dvipdf
dvipdfm

ALL gave live links except dvipdfm. It is possible whatever dvi viewer
you use doesn't support links.

dvipdfm is independent of the dvi viewer.  So it seems that neither yap 
nor dvipdfm supports live links.  I will try pdflatex.

This is certainly the best thing you can do.  But be aware that not
all PDF viewers support everything.  If in doubt, use Adobe Reader.

pdftex produces valid PDF, at least.  This is all it can do.  Many PDF
viewers only support a subset of the PDF (ISO 32000) standard.

I say this because Steve tested different viewers.  This shouldn't be
necessary because if a particular viewer doesn't support hyperlinks,
for example, then neither pdftex nor dvips can provide a workaround.
They both just produce valid PDF and that's all they can do.  It's
suffficient to use Adobe Reader for testing.

  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] fonts for maximal Unicode coverage?
Message-ID: <3a69fa7c0908021159n3782ba08k59288c5b6d740abc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I hope this is the right forum to ask this question...

I am using tetex on Linux Centos, and I was wondering which fonts I
should use to support as many Unicode characters as possible.

For instance, the CMR family doesn't seem to support code point U+00A2
(the inverted exclamation point.)
My test document for this is:

  \documentclass[10pt]{article}
  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
  \usepackage[russian]{babel}
  \begin{document}
  ...code-point for U+00A2...
  \end{document}

I am aiming for maximal coverage of code-points used for Western
languages + Cyrillic.

Thanks!

ER

U+00A2 is the cent sign. 00A1 is exclam down. Both are accessible
with textcomp: 

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{textcomp}
\begin{document}
\textcent
\textexclamdown
\end{document}

This is naturally the wrong driver for dvipdfm(x). I don't think
that html has an option to pass another option to hyperref, but you
can simply load hyperref before:

\usepackage[dvipdfm]{hyperref}
\usepackage{html}

Subject: [texhax] package option with arguments
Message-ID: <4A76E9F6.8090600@gmx.de>

Hi!

I?m trying to set up a package that has one optional argument. This
option can have several values that can be combined, like

\usepackage[exclude={greek,math}]{package}

Later I want to check if the argument has a certain string in it, in
this case e.g. if ?greek? is given. I tried it with \in@ but had no
success. This is my code:

\DeclareOptionX{exclude}{\def\excludeoptions{#1}}
\ProcessOptionsX

\in@{greek}{\excludeoptions}
\ifin@ \AtBeginDocument{greek is in}\fi

I use xkeyval for option processing.
\excludeoptions contains the expected string, but I did not manage to
get a true \ifin@, no matter how I used \expandafter or similar things.

Is this a total wrong way to do the task? Is there a tool that does it
less low-leve? I am totally clueless at the moment :(

cheers
Arno

Is something like (I'm assuming e-TeX):

\def\package at test@exclude{%
  \@for\@tempa:=\excludeoptions\do{%
    \ifcsname package at option@\@tempa\endcsname
      \@nameuse{package at option@\@tempa}%
    \fi
  }%
}
\ifx\excludeoptions\@emtpy\else
  \expandafter\package at test@exclude
\fi


a possible?  This of course assumes each potential exclusion is created
as a macro. (You could then trap unknowns by, for example, using
something else in place of \@tempa and ensuring that each option will
clear it, so if after the \do loop there is still something in the
variable then it's not been matched.)

Hello all,

I am trying to get the new pstricks-add to work;;; I'm running Ubuntu, 
which uses the ancient, out-of-date 2007.dfsg.8 version of 
texlive-pstricks, and the version of pstricks-add included (2.82, 
2006/11/22) lacks a number of new features.

I have installed the newest pstricks-add package from ctan, but that has 
caused some breakages.  At this point, it finds an "Undefined control 
sequence" in \psDEBUG, but surely there will be others.  I'd prefer not to 
update my entire tex tree by hand- can someone point me to the relevant 
packages I need to update?

Thanks in advance..

you should update the complete PSTricks files. You'll find
all files here in TDS compatible structure

http://archiv/dante.de/~herbert/PSTricks-TDS.tgz
http://archiv/dante.de/~herbert/PSTricks-TDS/

or write \def\psDEBUG[#1]#2{}

If it were that simple, namely the method to read .eps worked as well with 
.jpg etc., this would have been provided by the graphics bundle for more 
than 10 years. It is not -- of course. LaTeX can read the dimensions from 
an .eps because this information is contained in an .eps as a plain text 
line -- in those other files such information is encrypted in a binary way. 
Extracting it using "ordinary" TeX would require emulating real graphics 
software by TeX macros. This might (I am still not perfectly informed, 
please correct me) include emulating unzip by TeX macros -- an idea I like 
much; but there is an essential limitation: TeX's buffer size. There is a 
chance that the graphics file is too large and has too few "endline" bytes 
to be bitable for TeX.

I have now collected some relevant things from the UK TeX FAQ (searched for 
`png' and `jpg'). While in a parallel thread epstopdf and using PDFLaTeX 
rather than "ordinary" LaTeX was recommended, one may still prefer 
"ordinary" LaTeX, perhaps because one's DVI viewer shows the page one is 
editing more reliably than your PDF viewer (cf. pdfsync package). There are 
some nice extensions to the graphics bundle:

Betreff: [texhax] Using .png, .jpg, .gif

Hi all.

I've been playing with the graphicx package trying to figure out how to 
easily use non-postscript images in a latex doc. I know that I could use 
pdflatex, but then I'd have the inverse problem. I want a universal solution.

I'd like to get \DeclareGraphicsRule to work, but it seems more trouble to 
use than just converting each image file by hand.

For example, if I want to use a .png file:
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png, .eps}
\DeclareGraphicsRule{.png}{eps}{*}{`convert #1} %% (the last arg I've done 
in many different ways, e.g. {`convert #1 eps:- } )

then, in the body:

\includegraphics[width=1in]{myimage} %% (which is myimage.png)

I get an error msg telling me that I there is no bounding box. So in order 
to use it, I have to determine the bounding box for the image first, and 
then include that info into one or the other command. But, if I just do:

 > convert myimage.png myimage.eps

on the command line, it converts it without having to know the bounding box 
info. I'm not sure why convert needs the bounding box info in one case 
(latex) but not the other (command line).

So, I'm not really getting the point of \DeclareGraphicsRule since using it 
is much more trouble than converting by hand. Which brings me back to my 
point, is there any easy way to use non-postscript images in a latex doc? 
My best guess at this point is no, and the only way forward is to re-write 
some of the graphicx commands to that they can use the bounding box info 
generated by 'convert' or some other conversion program.

TIA for any help or discussion.

Beverley Eyre

It is important to recognize that importing a graphics file with LaTeX has 
two parts: 1. the LaTeX run (building a .dvi), 2. previewing or printing 
(executing \special commands from the .dvi).

The LaTeX run only needs to know the dimensions of the image. This is where 
the famous `bounding box' error occurs. LaTeX does not care about other 
contents of the graphics file. This other content is only used at getting 
visible output from the .dvi.

The command in the fourth argument is only used at the second step, 
creating a screen display or printout from the .dvi. This is too late to 
tell LaTeX the bounding box info!

Repeating:

>But, if I just do:
>

>

>box info.

It is wrong to say `convert' doesn't need knowledge of the bounding box. 
The truth is that `convert' is able to extract the bounding box information 
from myimage.png while LaTeX is not.

>  I'm not sure why convert needs the bounding box info in one case (latex) 
> but not the other (command line).

It is also wrong to say `convert' needs the bounding box info `in the LaTeX 
case'. The error message comes from LaTeX when it looks for that info in 
building the .dvi. As I said, `convert' is not involved at this first step.

It is described on pp. 75 of the TeXbook. With \frenchspacing, you get 
inter-sentence space just by ' ' or ''\space', i.e., inter-sentence space 
doesn't differ from inter-word space. With \nonfrenchspacing, you get the 
inter-sentence space the same way as before, if the current \spacefactor is 
3000, so just precede the same space with 
'\spacefactor=3000\relax\space'  ('\ ' in place of '\space' doesn't work). 
More generally, one might /define/ inter-sentence space as the horizontal 
glue that is inserted after the dot of '\spacefactor=1000. ' (arguing that 
`. ' is the "definitive sentence delimiter"). In this sense the space is 
obtained by '\spacefactor=\sfcode`\. '. (Note the space after '\.'. Not 
tested.)

Just a slight clarification for the required space after `\. 
or for any other char number. The space is there to terminate the number, as with all other numbers. If you don't have it, and the next character happens to be a number, TeX goes on evaluating digits, and you get a result that is much too large to be a char number. A good protection against this is {} or enclosing braces.

Subject: [texhax] class options with spaces
Message-ID: <4A79BBCF.5070208@gmx.de>

Hi,

I need the possibility to define class options that take an argument
with spaces, such as

\documentclass[use=section one]{myclass}

I try this using xkeyval:

\DeclareOptionX{use}{\def\use at content{#1}}

but the content of \use at content will be ?sectionone?. Is it possible to
save the spaces? I didn?t find anything in the xkeyval doc and
everything I tried (grouping in input etc.) was not successfull.

Only if you load one of the kernel patches before \documentclass. Both
kvoptions and xkeyval have patches for the problem.

Was my first thought, but:

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

               {scrartcl}

I don?t understand why I get this error ?

Thank you very much, I didn?t know that! It works fine ? but only at
user level :(
There is no way to use the patch in the class so the user won?t need to
add it?

So I might try it the other way round: As I want to compare the argument
of the class option to the argument of a user level macro, it should
work if I remove the spaces from the latter one. Maybe the better
question is:

given:
\documentclass[use=section one]{}
\usermacro{section one}

how can I compare the two using e.g. \ifthenelse{\equal{}{}} ?

cheers
Arno

I was not aware that '`\.' that behaves just like '3000' w.r.t. ensuing 
spaces (TeXbook pp. 269ff. on <normal integer>).

(Instead I thought that '\.' is a control symbol, so according to p. 46 ...)

This means that in order really to produce a space (that obeys 
\spacefactor), you have the following options:

     '\spacefactor=3000 \space'
     '\spacefactor=3000\relax\space'
     '\spacefactor=3000{} '
     '\spacefactor=\sfcode`\. \space'
     '\spacefactor=\sfcode`\.\relax \space'
    '\spacefactor=\sfcode`\.{} '

(tested). These fail (immediate '\space' our repeated blank space):

     '\spacefactor=3000\space'
     '\spacefactor=3000 '
     '\spacefactor=\sfcode`\. \space'
     '\spacefactor=\sfcode`\. '

Ok, I managed that using \zap at space #1 \@empty.
Is this a good solution or can it be solved better?

I was not aware that '\sfcode`\.' behaves just like '3000' w.r.t. ensuing 
spaces (TeXbook pp. 269ff. on <normal integer>).

(Instead I thought that '\.' is a control symbol, so according to p. 46 ...)

This means that in order really to produce a space (that obeys 
\spacefactor), you have the following options:

     '\spacefactor=3000 \space'
     '\spacefactor=3000\relax\space'
     '\spacefactor=3000{} '
     '\spacefactor=\sfcode`\. \space'
     '\spacefactor=\sfcode`\.\relax \space'
    '\spacefactor=\sfcode`\.{} '

(tested). These fail (immediate '\space' or repeated blank space):

     '\spacefactor=3000\space'
     '\spacefactor=3000 '
     '\spacefactor=\sfcode`\.\space'
     '\spacefactor=\sfcode`\. '

Uwe,

First, I'd like t say thanks for your replies. They are just what I need.

Ok, given that the situation is as you describe it, the next obvious 
question is, since LaTeX (or the graphicx package)  goes to the trouble 
to find the bounding box info for [e]ps files, can we get it to get it 
to find the bounding box info from .png or .jpg files? We know it can be 
done because both convert and pdflatex do it. This sounds like a 
question of a few lines of code, no?

Before I try it, I'd like your input.

thanks again

Bev

I don't see a need to hyper link to the end of the document

the situation may be better:

For usual purposes, you can start a page in one-column and continue in 
two-column without multicols.sty. Cf. the UK TeX FAQ:

     http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=onecolabs

Does this help you?

It will work for limited image file sizes only (may be ok for a usually 
small page).

What I like most is the ebb program since it just extracts the bounding box.

But to do the same with TeX, the first thing is knowing the algorithms ebb 
uses. I don't have any idea of them.

Moreover, TeX would have to do calculations that are described in the code 
of ebb in quite an efficient way. Calculating with TeX has a tendency to be 
clumsy -- well some macros can improve this. But the TeX code won't be 
shorter than the source code of ebb, so I don't expect that it will be a 
few lines of code. Even the lines in graphics.sty for reading the bounding 
box from .eps are not "few", I would say.

Use \pageref* instead, which suppresses the hyperlink. (FYI, \ref* does
the same for references.)

The file's original name is realcalc.tex (as you have noted). invoice.sty 
invokes realcalc by \input{realcalc}. The author of realcalc.tex and the 
readme did not foresee this when he recommended renaming the file to 
realcalc.sty. You must install it as realcalc.tex (in \tex\generic\realcalc?).

Subject: [texhax] derivatives and integrals: math operators
Message-ID: <200908061558.54952.natercia@eq.uc.pt>

Hi.
Math operators should be typeset in upright letters and also have a special 
spacing.
So shouldn't the "d" of derivatives (or integrals) be set with upright 
letters, since both are mathematical operators?

Already in 1997, there was an article published in TUGboat (Typesetting 
mathematics for science and technology according to ISO 31/XI) by Claudio 
Beccari and available at 
http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb18-1/tb54becc.pdf where he says that the 
"d" of derivatives and integrals should be upright (see item number 6).
It seems to make sense and I've been using it.

But at the same time, I haven't seen it being followed by other people...  For 
example, the work of Lars Madsen Introduktion til LaTeX doesn't.

Can anyone clarify this point to me, please?

Thank you very much,
Nat?rcia

Neither is a mathematical operator as far as mathematicians are concerned, and
we also don't set all operators upright -- only certain ones.

The convention you mention is one adopted by some physicists, engineers, and
other users of "applied" mathematics for reasons with which most (if not all)
"pure" mathematicians either just do not agree or regard as plain wrong.

I fall into one of those categories, and I typeset total differentials with

\newcommand{\td}[1]{\mathrm{d}#1}

Hmm.  I always thought that everything except variables is written
upright.  There might be different conventions, but are there any
rules?  There was a similar discussion a few years ago.  I don't
remember the details, but I remember that someone told me that he has
a book published in 18?? in the UK with "d" typeset upright.

What are the reasons and what are the exceptions you mentioned above?

"Limit-like" and "trig-like" operators and functions are set upright. For
example, lim, sin, log, ker, and tr. That's a rule.

Most operators named with a single letter are set italic. For example, a
(pseudo)differential operator P, a linear transformation L, a selfadjoint
operator A, etc. That's a convention, not a rule, but very few would dare
violate it.

Operator-like things (e.g., functors) that have multiletter names, such as
Spec, probably tend to be upright most of the time. But one may create an
exception if one is naming a new operator and wishes to do so. This is just a
guideline based on what most of us tend to do.

Examples do not prove theorems. English maths didn't catch up with everyone
else until almost C. 20 -- the Newton-Leibniz debacle crippled them for 200
years.

I don't know. I've heard many different ones from many different physicists,
sometimes more than one per physicist. Those in a specific area tend to agree
on how it's done in that area, but it varies widely from area to area.

Since we create the stuff, we get to make the rules, conventions, guidelines,
etc. Perhaps they want to change it so they can feel some sort of ownership of
it when they use it. (Who knows? I'm not a psychologist! But I suspect it's
more to keep us from reading physics too readily: we haven't paid our dues,
and physics is a lot easier to understand with advanced math than with
elementary math [a.k.a. "the hard way" or Phys 101 way].) 

Another physics quirk is to write \int dx\,f(x) instead of \int f(x)\,dx as we
do. That just creates unnecessary confusion, especially in elementary (as in
Calculus III) double and triple integrals.

And THE most annoying physics quirk is to use \otimes (tensor product) for
\times (set product). That's just plain stupid.

Goodness! What a tirade against physicists, all over a tiny difference of
notational convention. Did you suffer some sort of converse to the
apocryphal story about Alfred Nobel and the lack of a mathematics prize? :)

I have to disagree here. I think people do this precisely to avoid
confusion in multiple definite integrals. Writing

  \int_0^1 dx \int_{-1}^1 dy f(x,y)

makes it clear which limits belong with which variable, whereas

  \int_0^1 \int_{-1}^1 f(x,y) dx dy

can easily lead to mistakes (at least amongst my Calculus I students!).
Especially if f(x,y) is a long and complicated expression, pushing the
measure far away from the limits. An alternative is to indicate the
variables explicitly in the limits,

  \int_{x=0}^{x=1} \int_{y=-1}^{y=1} f(x,y) dx dy

but this seems to be too long-winded for most people.

And THE most annoying mathematics quirk is to expend inordinate amounts of
time arguing over notation and trivialities (entire papers of the stuff!)
rather than publishing something with actual content ;-)

I enjoyed this discussion. Basically I see no reasons beyond aesthetic

Some of my esteemed colleagues even do not write dx at all.

At let me quote myself "All mathematicians understand and know
integral of cocycle over cycle. However some mathematicians still
remember very esoteric notion of \int_a^b f(x) dx"  :-)

How does one know when the integral ends with this notation?  
Especially if something comes after the f(x, y), such as

\int_0^1 dx \int_{-1}^1 dy f(x,y) + \pi

Does one integrate f(x, y) + \pi, or do we add \pi to the final result?

To mean the same as the really weird notation of your first equation  
(which I had never seen), and the complete formula below, it should be

\int_0^1 \int_{-1}^1 f(x,y) dy dx

And I don't see how that's ambiguous. The \int is the start of the  
operator, the dx (or similar) is its end. And just like with  
parenthesis, brackets, etc, the first dx ends the last integral, and  
so on.

Although I don't know anything definitive (if there is anything 
definitive, which I doubt) the following rule appears to be in effect--and 
in any case, it is the one I use.  Multi-character identifiers are set 
upright and single character identifiers are in mit.  This is based more 
on practice (where the differential operator d and the base of the natural 
logarithm e are generally seen in mit).  It makes sense since that is how 
we distinguish s*i*n from sin (there is also a thin space after sin).

The old rule seems to have been that constants are upright and variables 
in mit, but where does that leave the differential operator d?  In any 
case the distinction is not always clearcut.  For example, the sentence, 
"\pi can be as small as 2 on a sphere" makes perfect sense.

It seems to have been computer scientists who started using (at least on a 
large scale) multi-letter identifiers for variables.  Now at least some 
mathematicians are doing likewise.  Putting them in mit would only sow 
confusion.  I guess you could use \textit, but the distinction between 
that and mit is mostly in the spacing and pretty subtle.

The distinction above is the one I enforce (more or less) as TeX editor of 
an online journal (Theory and Applications of Categories).  It is purely 
pragmatic, not based on any principle.

I see a trouble with the principle "consistent notations for all
articles in this journal" vs
"consistent notations for all articles of this author"

In your example, I think the usual convention would apply: products bind
more strongly than addition, so the "+ \pi" isn't integrated over. But in
general, brackets might be necessary to avoid ambiguity.

True. Which only illustrates my point :)

I never said it was ambiguous, just that it's liable to lead to mistakes
in calculations. Which is why some physicists (who, after all, are
generally the ones who have to *compute* definite integrals) sometimes
prefer to place the measure next to the integral.

The problem stems from having to scan all the way to the end of the
expression and parse the ordering, just to figure out which limit applies
to which variable, whilst the integration itself is being carried out left
to right. This seems to confuse the human brain, and be prone to errors.

If NASA engineers can crash a Mars orbiter by forgetting which units
they're supposed to be using, physicists can get integrals wrong by
applying the wrong limits to the wrong variable. It seems to me that
there's a valid argument for notational help in avoiding mistakes like
this, and that it shouldn't be dismissed out of hand as "creating
unnecessary confusion".

> And just like with parenthesis, brackets, etc, the first dx ends the
> last integral, and so on.

The notation for integration is rather unique and unusual in mathematics.
The vast majority of operators don't get split up in this way. Opening and
closing delimiters are often confusing for human brains to parse (ever
tried to read a large block of unindented Lisp code? :)

I'm not advocating religiously putting the measure next to the integral in
all cases. I just think the notation has its place, and it seemed worth
attempting to explain why I believe it's used occasionally.

Let an author come to me with that claim and I will allow it.  Mostly they 
don't have a clue to what their doing and consistency with their other 
papers (published where, that would allow, say Hom, to be in italics?).  I 
said, "more or less".

Anyway, I do get authors who say that don't like our theorem macros and 
want to use their own and I say "no way".  If we want to look like a 
journal, we have to have some consistent formatting requirements.  These 
are totally relaxed for our reprint series that often uses scanned 
versions of the original (and sometimes retyped versions, otherwise 
recompiled versions if it machine readable).

Nice to hear. But most of the printed journals are not so relaxed.
Anyway, the zeal of some participants of the discussion is both
amazing and amusing :-)

I am forwarding a recent CTAN announcement of an update of the bmeps 
package which is mentioned in the UK TeX FAQ concerning importing graphics 
with the LaTeX graphics bundle.
bmeps converts certain graphics formats into EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) 
which is the only graphics format that LaTeX can read with the graphics 
bundle. The announcement is more specific about what bmeps actually provides.

HTH -- Uwe.

I think this is *partially* a UK/US or European/US thing, with the US almost 
always using the italic d. Personally, I much prefer the upright d.

Here?s the command I use to type it:

% 'Magical' differential operator, that can be used for everything,
% taken from http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb18-1/tb54becc.pdf.
% Using improved (and much shorter) version from Morten H?gholm 
<mh.ctan at gmail.com>.
\newcommand*\diff{
   \mathop{}\nobreak
   \mskip-\thinmuskip\nobreak
   \mathrm{d}
}

You use it like this: \int f(x)\diff x.

There?s also one for \partial:
\newcommand*\pdiff{
   \mathop{}\nobreak
   \mskip-\thinmuskip\nobreak
   \partial
}

One advantage of these commands is that they get the spacing right, both for 
integrals and other expressions, such as fractions. But for ?inline? 
fractions, e.g., dy/dx, you need this macro the get the spacing perfect:

% And a 'magical' fraction slash, also from Morten H?gholm:
\providecommand*\ifrac[2]{
  \begingroup #1 \endgroup
  % A Close / so no space before it (unless a punctuation atom is the
  % last item in #1 but unlikely).
  \mathclose{/}%
  % Followed by an empty Open. Thus no space is inserted before the
  % denominator.
  \mathopen{}%
  \begingroup #2 \endgroup
}

It?s also quite useful in that you can easily switch between a \frac and 
\ifrac if you later decide one looks better than the other.

Here is an ironic example. I needed to do an e-book full of illos.  
I first set it up in Scribus.  Scribus generates very large pdf 
files. The Web host (Booklocker) had a limit on file sizes. So I 
redid it in pdftex to get the file size down. 

The irony is in the subject of the e-book. See below.

To me, it's not a tirade, just an observation with appropriate note of my not
being professionally qualified in psychology.

The whole is the result of almost 40 years of working with, and reading papers
by, physicists -- my "gut reaction" to it all.

If your experience is different, I can't speak to that.

Hi All, I've been looking for a way to simplify my latex and
package installs.  I've been using various packages from the
pkgsrc package manager but I think it's really not optimal for
latex plus packages.

Have been looking at TexLive but not able to get it working
on netbsd.  I understand that binaries are not available for
netbsd, but I assumed TexLive provided a means to compile required
programs. Does texlive support bootstraping the environment when
it is necessary to compile the programs?

Or, maybe I need to compile a suite before I can use the TexLive
manager? I'm not seeing TexLive dependancies though. What do I
need in place before I can use TexLive?

In differential geometry "d" is frequently used for the
exterior differential operator. As such, some people
(including myself) typeset it in upright letters.
This "d" is not sinply AN operator, but a specific
(and very important) one.  I use the same convention
for other one-letter operators (as the tangent map, or
the jet bundles).
The "d" in integrals has a meaning close to that of
differential geometry, and therefore I also put it
upright.

(By the way, the judgement on a notation should be
based on its usefulness and coherence, and not on who
is presumed to use it.  I also support putting the
differential next to the integral sign, for reasons 
that have already been exposed.)

enable the creation of png in the Perl script pst2pdf
you'll find the location with
kpsewhich pst2pdf.pl

then your tex file with pst2pdf, then you get in a subdirectory
images/ all pspicture environments as single eps, pdf, and
png images

It suddenly occured to me: if we want to adopt this principle (and I'm
not _entirely_ convinced I do ;-)), I guess we need to look into how
Leibniz typeset the "d" of total differentials.  Does anyone know?

(The answer "he used whatever typepiece the printer had to hand on the
day he walked into the print shop" strikes me as a strong
possibility.)

Subject: [texhax] clip postscript figures by page
Message-ID: <36770.79.47.98.108.1249806687.squirrel@imapfis.ct.infn.it>

Hi,

I use the graphicx package to embed PostScript figures in LaTeX, and I am
aware of the useful "clip" option in \includegraphics, which enables to
embed only a trimmed area of a given postscript file, by specifying an
appropriate bounding box.

Suppose now the postscript file contains several pages: is there something
like a "clip" option that allows one to first select a given page, then
clip that page to the desired bounding box?

Thanks for your feedback.

Regards,

Giuseppe.

Italic, not upright. (I also teach math history, so do some research in it.)

Also at that time it was common to switch from Greek to Latin letters to
indicate taking limits. Hence \Sigma_i f(x^*_i) \delta x_i became [integral
sign] f(x) dx where Leibniz chose for [integral sign] the common Italic u.c.
"S" of the day, which is an elongated, smoothed shape that is now used only
for the integral sign. (Together with several later variants.)

Most math history texts will show some reproductions of printed pages of the
era in which this is well seen in context.

Message-ID: <20090809093529.GA27206@piper.oerlikon.madduck.net>

Hi folks,

I am working on my PhD thesis, and some of the section titles break
lines too early, e.g.

  1.2.3  This is a section which
         line-breaks

  And this is text that extends to \textwidth just like it should
  further exemplifying that the section title is not properly
  rendered.

I cannot reproduce this in a test document, even when using scrbook,
and drilling down/bisecting until I have the cause is too complex
with a 300 page document making extensive use of LaTeX.

Thus my question: what influences the section rendering and how can
I make sure that the minipage or whatever it is that causes it to
wrap extends to \textwidth?

Thanks,

The numbers must be integers. Use lengthtest:

\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage{ifthen}

\newcommand{\whichisgreater}[2]{%
   \ifthenelse{\lengthtest{#1cm < #2cm}}{%
     Two!
     #2

Hi folks,

I am using the scrbook class for a thesis. I'd like to reformat the
way that \part{}s appear in the TOC, e.g.

instead of

  II   Research

I want

  _________________________________________________________________
  Research

I have played around with the tocloft package, but the closest
I could come was

  \renewcommand{\cftpartpresnum}{\protect\mbox{}\protect\hrulefill\par}
  \cftpagenumbersoff{part}

which produces

which is quite ugly. ;)

Any idea how I can achieve what I want?

You can try to use the key "page" to select a page. With pdf it
works fine but I don't know if it can also handle ps-files.

Hi TeXers,

I have encountered a difficulty with using custom commands from inside 
\rput.  When the commands define new macros, those macros aren't visible 
from outside the \rput.  In the example below, the command defines 
\theresult-- the first reference to \theresult works; the second reports 
an "Undefined control sequence".  Is there any way to make the results of 
the computation visible outside of the \rput scope?

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pstricks-add}
\usepackage{fp}

\newcommand{\compute}[2]{%
   \FPmul\theresult{#1}{#2}
   \theresult
}

\begin{document}
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(5,5)

\rput(2,2){\compute{0.4}{0.377}
   \rput(10,0){\theresult} % this one works fine
}

\rput(10,5){\theresult}  % this one gives an error

\end{pspicture}
\end{document}

Thanks in advance,
Brandon

The argument of \rput is internally inside a local group.
Try this:

\makeatletter
\newcommand\compute[2]{%
  \FPmul\pst at tempa{#1}{#2}
  \global\let\theresult\pst at tempa}
\makeatother

Thank you- that seems to work great.  Two follow-up questions: what's a 
good reference to understand scoping in TeX?  and if I were to put this 
command declaration with related ones in a .sty file, well.. what's a good 
reference to understand how to do that well?  Learning by trial and error 
(and texhax as a last resort) is getting tiring.

Kind regards,
Brandon

TeX by Topic (http://eijkhout.net/texbytopic/texbytopic.html) is also very
useful.

And, not specifically for scoping but for other low-level things, the
LaTeX source itself (the source2e.pdf file somewhere in your texmf tree)
is much more helpful than your average source code, since it's written in
literate programming style.

AFAIK epub is basically XHTML + images, wrapped in a container with
metadata (in XML).

So you need to get XHTML & images from your TeX files. Try tex4ht.

Hi Doc,
I think this would be the right forum to ask. I have no personal experience
with this type of conversion, but I would suggest the following:

1) convert TeX to html using one of the many available converters (tex2html,
tex4ht, etc.)

2) convert the html file you obtained in step 1 to epub using either getepub
(http://www.bookglutton.com/api/docs/d/getepub) or Calibre (
http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/download)

Since epub is an xhtml+css+mathml based standard, I'm sure this qould at
least get you something decent to work with that you can then improve upon,
if needed.

I remember having read about an effort to write an opensource tex2epub
program that is close to completion, but the source eludes me at the moment.
I'll write again if I remember the source...

Cheers,
Yuri.

epub authoring tools are few and far between at this point in time.

I don't know of any which accept plain tex as input --- though one  
might be able to input LaTeX into OpenOffice, then use this:

http://infogridpacific.typepad.com/publishing_with_xml/2009/02/escape-open-office-to-EPUB-convertor.html

Here's a list of tools / commentary on .epub authoring tools:

http://www.helpandmanual.com/

http://blogs.adobe.com/billmccoy/2007/08/authoring_epub.html

Ultimately though a .epub is an xml file like to .html, so typical  
conversion techniques should work --- good discussion here:

http://www.teleread.org/2008/05/16/epub-demystified-tomorrows-e-book-reader-the-web-browser/

If your markup is consistent and high-level enough you might be able  
to do the conversion directly and manually:

    And, not specifically for scoping but for other low-level things, the
    LaTeX source itself (the source2e.pdf file somewhere in your texmf tree)
    is much more helpful than your average source code, since it's written in
    literate programming style.

I echo that, and let me mention that for people who like to read on
paper, it's available at http://www.lulu.com/content/837928, thanks to

I gave this to my TexShop on my fully upgraded Mac OSX.  It failed!

But running latex from the command line it was ok.

goole pstextpath gave:
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/pstricks/1997/000029.html
which contained:
\pstextpath{\nccurve{1,3}{3,1}}{Test Text}

So the form is:
\pstextpath{Path}{Text}

then:

\pstextpath
{\pscurve(-1.41,0)(-1,-1)(0,0)(1,-1)(1.41,0)}
{\color{blue}\large Esta frase sinuose y peculiar est\'a escrita a log 
largo de la curve $y=x^4-2x^2$}

works.

I'll try using tex4ht (as also suggested by Martin) and see how close to
usable the result is.

I realise that it's really quite a hard problem to go from input that's
supposed to define real typography to something that's basically mark-up; I
have several quite low-level macros to handle some special cases, and I'll
be quite surprised if they they transfer intelligently -- but I'm hoping.

Google turned up zero hits on "tex2epub", and I tried a few other
reasonable searches but couldn't discover anything useful :-(

Subject: [texhax] ligature fi doesn't render - what to do?
Message-ID: <EAA2F21A-F914-4371-8F1A-8DAD4FA8C64E@gmail.com>

I have the MyriadPro font installed in a TexLive (MacTeX) 2009
(preview) installation.

My map file has entries such as this one:

wmrbi6t MyriadPro-BoldIt "ReEncodeFont" <texnansi.enc <wmrbi6t.tfm   
<MyriadPro-BoldIt.pfb

The problem is that the "ff" and "fl" ligatures (and possibly more)  
aren't rendered at all.  "fi" works, as does, of course, "f{}f". The  
error message that I'm seeing is
pdfTeX warning: pdflatex (file /usr/local/texlive/2009/../texmf-local/
fonts/type1/adobe/myriad/MyriadPro-Bold.pfb): glyph `ff' undefined

Would it be possible to get the metrics (this is what is missing,  
right?) for those ligatures?  If so, how?
Alternatively, can I tell TeX to render "ff" as "f{}f" in general,  
rather than rendering empty space?

I don't know much about all this TeX font stuff, but I'm willing to  
learn.  So, your help would be appreciated!

Kaveh Bazargan gave a talk "TeX as an ebook reader" at TUG 2009
recently. I do not know whether it was taped and/or appear in 
tugboat though. But i guess XML that River Valley delivers
to Elsevier will be able to be reformatted on the fly
in ebook readers. So try searching harder with these new words ;-).

We will soon make a public release of Elsevier XML to epub, the final  
testing is going on intensely. Also, we plan to release similar  
conversion tools for Docbook, NLM and TEI DTD's.

gerree,

    I'm in need of a binary symbol called
    interior product ... I have searched through the many
    manuals ... could not locate it ... standard math symbol?

this symbol exists in unicode; see the
chart at
  http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2A00.pdf
where it appears in position 2A3C.  (some
mathematicians prefer the upright leg to be
longer than the one on the bottom; that's
a recognized variant.)

however, i don't know of current availability
in any tex font, although this is being worked
on.  for the present, i suggest hacking it
together from a vertical and a horizontal line
in a box, making that \mathbin, and calling it
\intprod (that's what it will be called in the
stix font, once latex support is created).

    Please email your response to myself and Professor Kohn.

done.

While not tex2epub, Sigil might be of interest as well:

http://code.google.com/p/sigil/

It's an opensource epub authoring tool

Thanks, but in my case I already have the source files in plain TeX format;
so my problem is not in creating the input, it's in taking valid plain TeX
input and producing as-close-to-usable-as-possible EPUB output.

Message-ID: <7f5ddb200908141628m1e9b9430j92d19870b971c084@mail.gmail.com>

hi (esp. to Radhakrishnan and Karl),

if I understood Karl Berry's message (17 Jul 2009) correctly, he and
Radhakrishnan are taking over the maintenance of tex4ht? This is great
news! Thank you, guys!

Karl's and Radhakrishnan's recent postings regarging biblatex helped
me a lot and I'm looking forward to the release that will fix the
problem.

Here is another issue that bugs me in using biblatex and tex4ht together:

I always get the following error on \printbibliography (if I don't
include a bibliography, everything works fine):

! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> ... \c at refsection -\bib at field@entrykey

That error can be ignored by pressing enter (quite a few times) and
the bibliography will be produced anyway, with no apparent errors, as
far as I can see. The error should be reproducable with the sample
files posted earlier on this list
(http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/attachments/20090716/cca290bc/attachment-0001.zip)
by adding \printbibliography to the document.

a second issue is that I am getting an extra space after the first
paranthesis in author-year styles, i.e. Author ( 2009). I also found
some irrelavent spaces after a quotations mark ("). It's not a big
issue since it can easily be fixed manually with seach&replace, but it
might be worth fixing it sometime anyway. - Or maybe I am doing
something wrong? I think, also this can be reproduced if you change
the test-files mentioned above to an authoryear-style and use
\parentcite or \citet or so.

About my system: I am working with MikTeX but I uninstalled the te4ht
MiKTeX package and installed the latest bugfix-version from
http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/bugfixes.html. (see
http://schlosser.info/latexsystem-en.html#x1-200003.6).

Finally, I was confused that some of the files from the latest tex4ht
bugfix-version (http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/fix/tex4ht-1.0.2009_06_11_1038.tar.gz)
are actually older than the ones in the latest MikTeX-package. Maybe
this is due to the packaging? Or are the files in the MiKTeX pakages a
different tex4ht edition altogether?

Thanks for any help or comments.

You can't. The LaTeX Companion tells you to move it to the ``main  
galley''. What I do in those cases is to move the text with vspace (I  
have to use \par or \ [space] to make it work); v.gr.,


\marginpar{\par \vspace*{-4pc} Text.}

Thanks for the quick replies.

I tried minipage-marginpar package before, but it did not write at  
exactly the same line where the note should appear, unlike the usual  
\marginpar. Am I right?

Subject: [texhax] Page numbers with pdfpages
Message-ID: <4A86CE6C.2000400@i3s.unice.fr>



    Dear TUGers,

    I'm using the 'pdfpages' package to insert PDF files into my tex 
document:

    \usepackage[final]{pdfpages}
     ...
    \includepdf[pages=-, fitpaper=false, scale=0.95]{myfile.pdf}


    The original tex source file uses the standard 'book' class, with 
headers showing the chapter/section names + page numbers.

    After running pdflatex, all pages of 'myfile.pdf' appear as 
required, but the original page layout of the original source file, and 
in particular the page numbers, are missing.

    How can I insert the pdf files while keeping the original source layout?

    Thank you very much for your help.

    Best wishes,

    - Vicente.

The same kind of error, I made a quick fix for the same.

I don't think so. MikTeX developers should have generated all the  
packages afresh from the literate sources provided by Eitan, which  
would insert the date of generation as the package date.

I have copied a bug fixed version to:

   http://tug.org/~cvr/biblatex.4ht

which you may try. Looking forward to your feedback.

Slightly OT... where is the reflector/list for tex4ht? I found one, but the
archives are completely empty, so it looks like no messages have ever been
posted there :-(

I'm in the early stages of using tex4ht and I can tell that I'm going to
have some simple questions that must surely have been asked and answered
before, but I don't know where to find a record of those discussions.

That's because that list is all new. I read about it only an hour ago...
TeX4ht was a project by Eitan Gurari who sadly passed away in June. I am
glad to read that Radhakrishnan CV has volunteered to take over at least
part of the maintanance work. Thank you, Radhakrishnan.

For the more or for the less simple questions on TeX4ht you might like
to search the Google Groups archives of the comp.text.tex newsgroup.
This is where most TeX4ht discussion used to take place. Eitan used to
be quite helpful answering users' questions. So you may put your
questions on TeX4ht there, too, or here on the texhax list.

Hope this helps.

J?rgen.

you are just incredible! it works! thank you so much. this is wonderful!

this encourages me to mention two issues I encountered with oolatex
which do not occur with htlatex:

1.
 \subsubsection* is not rendered properly. oolatex produces a
paragraph (i.e. an empty line) and the subsubsection-title is printed
as ordinary text at the beginning of the next paragraph. Then
non-starred version of \subsubsection works fine.

2.
I have defined the following new environment for myself to have
certain paragraphs printed in italics and in a smaller font:

\newenvironment{stub}%
{
\begin{flushleft}\footnotesize
\begin{it}
}%
{
\end{it}
\end{flushleft}
}

this is rendered fine with htlatex but not with ootlatex. In oolatex,
the text is printed as ordinary text. or rather: in the same size and
style as ordinary text, but formated as "flushleft".
in fact, oolatex also prints all footnotes in the ordinary fontsize
although they are formated as "footnote", which is, by default defined
as smaller than ordinary test in openffice. (htlatex renders footnots
properly, though it puts them in seperate html-files, which is a bit
annoying but not a bug, I guess.)

    I'm in the early stages of using tex4ht and I can tell that I'm going to

In addition to the other advice, I suggest looking at Eitan's web pages,
still up at http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/, and any
examples you can find -- the TeX Live manual is the one I know about.

Also and perhaps most importantly, he wrote one article, posted at
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb25-1/gurari.pdf, which attempts to be
an introduction to the system.

Unfortunately my only reliable recipe for solving problems was
"ask Eitan" :(.

I don't know. I haven't used minipage-marginpar; but with either this  
or a simple marginpar, try \vspace*, with positive or negative value.  
Maybe a simple

\marginpar{\vspace*{-3pc}A test.}

will suffice. If there is no change, try a \par to make it work:

\marginpar{\par\vspace*{-4pc}A test.}


Best,

I think the bottom part can be done using tabular.  But any suggestion
for the two bounding boxes on top?  They should be fixed in size and
position with textual contents.

Here is what worked for me :

  \documentclass[11pt]{article}

  \begin{document}

  \fbox{\parbox{.3\textwidth}{%
  Mr. No Name \\
  Door No. \\
  Street \\
  City}}
  \fbox{\parbox{.3\textwidth}{%
  Mr. No Name \\
  Door No. \\
  Street \\
  City}}

  \end{document}

The other table as you said can be done using tabular.

Unfortunately, I could not replicate your errors. Can you please take  
a look at:

which has test.tex, test.html and test.odt. Seems like oolatex behaves

Christopher, I just found your site

Thanks for your TeX work (worX?).  I look forward to using your

Note that the FontSite 500 CD has been discontinued.  There are about
39 copies left for sale (i just bought one for $39.95 plus S & H).

For purchase, e-mail <joyce at fontsite.com>.

Subject: [texhax] modifying \overline
Message-ID: <200908171703.n7HH3We5016765@mfe02.daimi.au.dk>

\overline does not behave wull with math italics. For example, look at
$\overline{H}$ or $\overline{\partial}$ -- the overline sticks out too far to
the left. If I understand correctly, it is not respecting the \skewchar of the
math italic font.

What I would like to do is create a "modified \overline" command that would
place an overline of the appropriate length "italic centered" on math italic
fonts. It looks as if all that needs changing is the left starting point of
the overline (hence its length, too) as the right ending point appears to be
in the correct place. If I understand the TeX book correctly, that's what
\skewchar is for; I just don't understand how to use it here.

Perhaps this has already been done, but I've been unable to find it or
construct my own. I've looked in the TeX book, Voss's mathmode, and the UK
FAQ. Probably there's something about \overline I don't understand so that I
can't figure out how to make a new version that "italic centers" the overline.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

TeX works with boxes while not knowing anything about the glyphs that will eventually
be rendered. In many cases the boxes correspond quite closely to the bounding boxes
of the characters, and then overline more or less matches. With italic characters,
the glyphs may extend beyond the character heights and widths defined in the tfm
file. You're stuck here.

What you could do is make a virtual font where the overlines are included on a
character by character basis. There are underline fonts that do this so that
descenders are not overwritten, and an analogous overline font would be pretty easy
to construct.

Cheers,
Michael

Hey folks,

Attached test document uses scrbook, and the chapter nicely opens on
an odd page, and the page number is on the bottom right (the outer
edge on odd pages).

However, the gutter (binding margin) also seems to be on the *outer*
edge, which is just wrong. Could someone please enlighten me and
tell me how to get the gutter to the inner edge?

Use accents.sty or maybe amsmath.

Hi Martin,
I must admit that I'm not familiar with Koma script at all.  But maybe
you find something useful in the documentation if you search for
"typearea".

The outer margin is always bigger than the inner one for a couple of
good reasons.

Maybe it's worthwhile to buy a book about typography.  Such books are
very expensive.  But there is an exception:

  Hans Peter Willberg, Friedrich Forssman:  Erste Hilfe in Typografie,
  Verlag Hermann Schmidt, Mainz, 1999, ISBN 3-87439-474-3.

The title of this book (First Aid in Typography) is quite unfortunate 
because it implies that it's written for greenhorns only.

The opposite is the case.  It's one of the best books about typography
I'm aware of.  And it's extremely beautiful.

The price is only 12.80 EUR.  This is quite amazing because the book
even demonstrates different types of paper.

In short: It's definitely worth the money.

Regards,
  Reinhard

That depends on whether what's being set is fiction or non-fiction. It's
not at all uncommon for fiction (or even non-fiction intended for a lay
audience) to be set with inner margins that are the same or wider than
outer margins. It wasn't clear to me what sort of book the OP was talking
about, so I felt like I had to make this clarification.

  Doc

PS I just picked five novels from my shelves and looked: all had inner

My experience with virtual fonts is \emptyset. My knowledge is that they

Its some time ago since I was faced with the same "bug".
Afterwards I learned that the correct typographic rules say as far as I 
remember:

Open a book to have two pages in front of you .... the amount of the inner 
margins left side page and the inner margin right side page should be 
identical to the left resp. right page outer margin. This creates a beautiful 
centred column look, pleasant for the readers eyes.   
E.g.

|2cm----Text----1cm|1cm---Text---2cm| 

Often this looks odd if you print out the draft single sided e.g. for 
corrections. Nevertheless, if you are going to create a real big book and 
depending on the way you like to bind the manuscript, you might like to add an 
additional space to correct the amount of margin which get lost by binding and 
bending the pages. AFAIR this was a single command or parameter which has to 
be set explicitly in the TeX header (standard is no add. space for binding).
The result should be again the same as described above, therefore you have to 
choose the amount of add. space wisely.

Unfortunately, nowadays there are a lot of "wrong" publications on the market 
influenced by MS-Word style, even from the big publishing companies .... so 
Rheinard is right to refer to a typographic book (btw. thanks for the title).

Nowadays, there are so many just plain wrong publications that one should read 
about the correct way, since it is difficult to find it out by looking at some 
good examples from the shelf (as doc mentioned). Not only it will not be 
teached in any course I am aware off, but more strange schools and universities 
teach how to use MS-Word and MS-Powerpoint (which are known to rape 
typographic rules) and miss to teach just plain basic correct ways of 
typographic rules which can be applied independently of any software or OS or 
budget by using even pencil and paper. 

The results are very cruel if you ever have the chance or duty to receive and 
proceed a bunch submissions from academics you now what I mean. ;)

Regards,

Totti

There is some reason to have the inner margins as large ---or close  
to--- the outer margins, especially with relatively modern soft cover  
binding.

The theory is that the eye should see the same blank with the inner  
margins combined as with the outer margin. So one classical proportion  
could be a 6-2-5-4:

  __________________________________
  |       ^ 5            ^ 5        |
  |<->___________ <->___________ <->|
  | 4 |          | 4 |          | 4 |
  |   |          |   |          |   |
  |   |  Text    |   |          |   |
  |   |          |   |          |   |
  |   |          |   |          |   |
  |   |__________| ^ |__________|   |
  |       ^ 6      |      ^ 6       |
  |_______________2+2_______________|

But truth is books don't open flat, especially, as said, soft cover  
books. So, to compensate for the bend in the middle, yo have to make  
inner margins larger, so the eye **effectively** sees the same blank  
in the inner margins combined as with any of the outer margins.

Best,

Axel

Okay, this is a fair explanation. I think I was looking for the
wrong thing. KOMA actually allows you to cope for binding with the
BCOR setting, so e.g. BCOR1cm as document option takes 1cm off both
inner margins, assuming that these 2cm won't be seen due to the
binding the the relation between inner and outer margins is again
restored.

Thanks,

thanks for testing this. so here is what I get when using your
test.tex together with the mybib.bib:

1. trying to run latex on it gives me an error on \ConfigureEnv
(undefined control sequence)

2. oolatex accepts the command but it only renders the citations in
the first section, not the one in the subsection.

3. I have no Idea where the second and third reference in your
odt-file are from. I don't have these.

4. on the "positive" side, you are right that the stub-environment is
rendered properly. I have no idea, how it can be working for me on one
document but not in the other (I doublechecked!). Maybe something else
in the preamble of my other document? If you want, I can send it to
you.

5. also your starred subsection works. the problem is that I was
referring to a starred sub*sub*section, so if you substitute
\subesection* with \subsubsection* you should get the error, At least
I am still getting it.

What next?

BTW, I took a chance today in using oolatex on my thesis, which is
quie a bit more complicated than the other documents. The result was
sobering. I gut so many errors (mainly "undefined control sequence"
that I couldn't even count them. It ended where I had included a
pdf-graphic, which of course doesn't work with latex and hence with
oolatex. I haven't retried it without that figure, but if you are
interested to learn more about the errors I get, I can try and send
you at least a selection. But I suppose, you can take any bigger book
project and oolatex will not work...

Christoph

Wors fine here. Please take a look at the contents of the archive at:

   http://tug.org/~cvr/test.zip

Just copied the first item twice in mybib.bib and slightly changed the  
keys. That was to test footnote numbering.

OK, please do off the list.

That is true. Eitan provided 'ooffice' option as a proof of concept  
that even word processor formats can be generated from TeX sources  
with the help of TeX4ht. It is not perfect, though. If you want to  
make high fidelity output, you need to extend ooffice.4ht which is the  
package loaded in the background when you call 'oolatex'. You need to  
add extra hooks in a private configuration, which is the recommended  
way to do, where you can define new environments or modify existing  
ones to suit your requirements. I have done an example for you to fix  
the problem of \subsubsection* in a file namely, chris.cfg which is  
also included in the test.zip and listed below:

------------ begin private configuration ------------
\Preamble{ooffice}

\begin{document}
\catcode`:=11
\catcode`@=11

\Configure{likesubsubsection}
    {\IgnorePar\EndP \HCode{<!--start of subsubsection-->}}
    {\IgnorePar\EndP \HCode{<!--end of subsubsection-->}}
    {\HCode{<text:h
      text:style-name="\csname a:Heading-4\if at rl-rtl\fi\endcsname"
                    \text:outlinelevel="4"   ><text:span
                    text:style-name="subsubsection"  >}%
     \HCode{</text:span>}\IgnoreIndent}
    {\HCode{</text:h>\Hnewline}\par\ShowPar}
\catcode`:=12
\catcode`@=12

\EndPreamble
--------------- end private configuration ------------

You might invoke oolatex in the following fashion:

  oolatex test "chris"

and see the output. It should be OK.

This is quite imaginable. You have to create a custom package  
configuring all the environments, commands which were disliked by  
TeX4ht.

Those problems can be fixed without much difficulties. However,  
pressures at work don't allow me to spend more time on your project.  
Someone with more deeper knowledge of Open Office XML format will be  
the best candidate to perfect ooffice.4ht.

Message-ID: <28B122FF-CE06-494F-967F-B3F5504C0BA8@googlemail.com>

Hi,

I'm using \bibliographystyle{linquiry2} and have one bibtex entry  
that's causing me problems:

@InCollection{AH1998,
	author="Alsagoff, Lubna and Ho, Chee Lick",
	title="{The grammar of {S}ingapore {E}nglish}",
	booktitle="{English in New Cultural Contexts:\ Reflections from  
Singapore}",
	editor="Foley, Joseph A. and Kandiah, Thiru and Bao Zhiming and  
Gupta, Anthea Fraser and Alsagoff, Lubna and Ho Chee Lick and Wee,  
Lionel and Talib, Ismail L. and Bokhorst-Heng, Wendy",
	address="Singapore",
	publisher="Oxford University Press",
	pages="127--151",
	year=1998}

What I would like is for the \cite{AH1998} command to output "Alsagoff  
and Ho (1998)", and for the reference list to output "Alsagoff, Lubna,  
and Ho Chee Lick. 1998. The grammar of\ldots". Obviously, "Ho" is the  
surname and "Chee Lick" the given name. However I don't seem to be  
able to do this: I've tried several combinations but it seems  
impossible to have two sorts of surname/given name arrangements in the  
author field. Does anyone have a clue what I'm doing wrong?

Notice that in the "editor" field, I get the result I want by spelling  
out "Bao Zhiming" and "Ho Chee Lick", omitting the comma.

Thanks in advance.

Jakob

Message-ID: <311224200908240022q1e21af53u5c79258d3954040b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've recently installed a new Fedora 11 system with texlive 2007-42. This is
the first time I have texlive I should say. I have two adobe fonts that I've
used for a long time with tex and, although the installation process has
differed I have always managed to get it to work. This time I've installed
the fonts and the maps in a local texmf directory. updmap finds them and
complains about nothing. I can process documents with these fonts using
latex, producing dvi but I can't use pdflatex, nor dvips on the dvi file
produced. The error I'm getting is:

pdfTeX warning: pdflatex (file padr8r): Font padr8r at 864 not found

This must have something to do with the searchpats becuase these files exist
in the appropriate directories (I think) in my local texmf tree (in
/home/user/texmf/fonts/tfm etc..)

Any hints would be greatly appreciated.

best,

/H

Message-ID: <EF839489-D86E-474A-BBB0-C5D9791ECD52@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm new to Tex. I've downloaded the MacTex distribution.
All was OK so far.
I tried the example shown in the "Red me First " document. OK So far
After that I tried some sentences in french tthus containing ?, ? ?  
and accented letters.
Unfortunately those letters have disapeared in the output text. I mean  
a word like "o?" or "d?sesp?r?ment" results in "o" and "dsprment' in  
the output.
Could you tell me how to fix that problem? I suppose that MacTex Latex  
is language free and accept any language.
I also change some encoding schemes but with no succes.

In advance thanks for help

AFAIK there are two ways to get an accented letter in TeX. The first 
is to use the accent mark followed by the letter thus:
\`el\'eve. 

The second is to identify the placement of the accented form of the 
character on the font chart and use the \char(number) command. Both 
methods are covered in the TeXBook. 

Use of the actual accented character in your .tex file is likely to 
fail. Only characters in the ASCII character set should be used in 
your source file.

John Culleton's note:

Only applies if one wishes to limit oneself to working w/ Plain TeX in  
an unchanged version.

For LaTeX one would do something like:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage[applemac]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[frenchb]{babel}
\begin{document}

d?sesp?r?ment

?,
? ?

\end{document}

or if one wishes to stick to Plain TeX one could use xetex which would  
allow direct handling of UTF8 input.

Or use (as most beginners do and in my opinion should do) latex and
one of the encoding packages.

Hi all.

Sorry for not having thanked earlier who answered my question, but I was away 
and read the answers only now.

When I put this question, I didn't mean to start any "war".  I just wanted to 
be clarified whether it's more correct to use italic or upright "d" for 
derivatives and integrals, since I do use them a lot and I do want to follow 
the most appropriate notation.
I see the opinions are divided.  The mathematician Phil Parker defended 
strongly the italic "d" as I have seen it elsewhere. The oher participants 
that took a position defended the upright "d" (independently of being or not 
mathematicians). It seems there isn't a rule (at least a pacifically followed 
by everyone).

As a side product, I got another doubt: the derivatives and integrals are or 
are not mathical operators? I thought they were, but Phil Parker said neither 
of them was. However, Xavier Sabate also classified them as important operators 
and others also referred to them as operators...

Once again, thanks to everyone who answered.
Nat?rcia

Also, your editor should know which encoding you're using. As you are  
on a Mac with MacTeX distro, most likely you're using TeXShop as your  
editor. So, open TeXShop -> Preferences, and in the Source tab look  
into the lower right corner: Encoding. There you should make sure the  
encoding coincides with the one you choose in the line  
\usepackage[xxxxxx]{inputenc}.

For applemac as encoding, you must choose ``Western (Mac OS Roman)''  
as the encoding in TeXShop preferences.

Unlike William, though, I would advise you to use utf8 as the input  
encoding [``Unicode (UTF-8)'' in TeXShop preferences, ``  
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} '' in your LaTeX preamble]. To start with,  
Mac OS X uses UTF-8 as the default encoding, and so does Linux and, I  
think, recent Windows. Also, if you want to use XeTeX, as William  
advised, your encoding has to be utf8.

Best,

Axel

Hi,

 I have a general question in Latex2.0. I have to write a book, which will
have two main sections (with titles). I want the chapter numbers to be
continuous but in two different blocks. So the organisation is as follows :

Chapter 1 - Introduction
Section - I (Title of section I)
Chapter 2 - blah blah
Chapter 3 - blah blah
Chapter 4 - blah blah
Section - II (Title of section - II)
Chapter 5 - blah blah
Chapter 6 - blah blah
Chapter 7 - blah blah

 I want to insert a page after a section ends, giving the title of the
section (before chapter2 and chapter 5). Is there a package which will allow
me to define groups of chapters in this way and automatically include these
sections in the table of contents ? Or can you guide me in the right
direction if it is not available ?

I have the following questions with winedt 5.5: 



1) how do I move equation numbers from the left of the equation to the 
right? 



2) how do I eliminate the title of the ms. being printed on the top of every

No, Windows still uses the funny "code pages".

I see. I've found this in Wikipedia

Anyway, I think UTF-8 is the best encoding to use. Recent  
multiplatform (La)TeX editors (Linux, Mac, Windows), as TeXworks and  
TeXmaker, use UTF-8 as default encoding, and so, I believe, recent  
versions of Kile and Emacs 23.

LaTeX itself (but of course there are packages for customizing the  
look of sectioning environments and table of contents).

What you call section is called part in LaTeX (and publishing houses).  
See the lshort.pdf in

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/

especially section 2.7 Titles, Chapters, and Sections (pp.35 and ff.).

Best,

\part not \section.  No package needed.

Hi again,

Even if no noe has ideas of how to solve my problem specifically, does
anyone have a good tutorial on how to install fonts (manually) under
texlive, maybe I can figure out what I've done wrong.

Thanks for any help,

/Henrik

Karl Berry made a reference to

http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html

Didn't it work for you?

As you have TeXLive 2007, the difference with that web page is, *I  
think*, that your system-wide local additions should go in /usr/local/ 
share/texmf, instead of /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local.

Also, at that web page there is a link to the Font Installation Guide.

Best,

Axel

Message-ID: <20090827175928.GA3652@piper.oerlikon.madduck.net>

Hi folks,

my style sheet uses \itshape for quotations. I have a few quotations
with \emph{} in them, and the proper thing to do would be to
de-emph{} (toggle emphasis) in this context. Can texlive do this?

Alternatively, what's a better way to make quotations appear
cursive?

Yes, I definitely did. I noticed in the PDF it said "(his emphasis)"
following a quotation, and I shrugged, because it was all cursive.

But then I tested it in a simple case and there it works.

Thanks to your input, I managed to trace this down to a stupidity
deep down in the .cls file I have to use, where \emph{} was
redefined.

I am sorry that I spammed the list without providing all the details
or running a simple test case.

Thank you for your patience.

Yes, he did. See here

Subject: [texhax] How to test for existence of a macro?
Message-ID: <4A9872F8.7000907@gmail.com>

I couldn't find this in the TeXbook, but perhaps I was just looking in the
wrong place.

How should I test cleanly for the existence of a particular macro?

The use case is that I have been using pdfTeX for quite some time, and
hence using commands of the form \pdfxxx with impunity. Now that I'm trying
to use tex4ht, the first thing that happens is that it halts with an error
as soon as it hits the first of those commands.

(Actually, I guess I'm making an assumption that the \pdfxxx commands are
equivalent to macros, even though they're built-in.)

Anyway, what I want to do is stuff like replacing:
  \pdfoutput=1
with something logically equivalent to:
  if (exists(\pdfoutput))
    \pdfoutput=1;
  else
    do something else;

Presumably to do this one creates:
\newif\ifpdf
and then sets it to true or false depending on whether (say) \pdfoutput is
defined... but I don't know how to perform the test to see whether
\pdfoutput is defined in a way that doesn't cause an error if it's undefined.

Subject: [texhax] Can't install tex on my PC
Message-ID: <207417.20601.qm@web55904.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

I have the 2008 DVD for Tex Live.  I am trying to install it on my PC but I cannot get it to work.


With the DVD in the PC, I found an install-tl icon and clicked on it.  A window opened up with an "Install texlive" button.  I clicked on it and the computer spent a couple of hours or more putting files
into the texlive/2008 folder.

But I can't find the exec file to run pctex or latex or anything like that.  In the  PC TeXLive 2008 folder, there is a PS_view icon, the Tex Live Manager, manuals in all languages, a toplevel readme index and TeXdoc GUI, which appears to be a TeX Documentation Browser.

I have Tex installed on my Mac, so I copied a Tex file from Mac to my flash drive and put the file on the PC  laptop, thinking if I tried to open that, it would automatically find the exec file for me, but Windows says it doesn't know what program created my Tex file.

Please advise!

Thank you,

Blessings,
Betty Harmsen

See the ifpdf package. It does exactly this.

Use \show

e.g

\show\TeX

Gives:

> \TeX=macro:
->T\kern -.1667em\lower .5ex\hbox {E}\kern -.125emX.

which means \TeX is defined and it is a macro not a primitive.

\show\pdfoutput

gives:

> \pdfoutput=\pdfoutput.

which means \pdfoutput exist and it is a primitive.

The secret is how \csname ... \endcsname acts when the specified
control sequence is not defined: if the resulting control sequence
token was not previously defined, the resulting control sequence acts
like \relax.  We can combine this with \ifx, which compares the value
of two marcos, as follows:

  % Prints `not defined'.
  \expandafter\ifx\csname foo\endcsname \relax not defined \else defined \fi
  
  \def\foo{}
  % Prints `defined'.
  \expandafter\ifx\csname foo\endcsname \relax not defined \else defined \fi

We need to use \expandafter as \ifx does not expand its arguments and
we want the expansion of the \csname ...\endcsname sequence.

Is it possible to use document class amsart and NOT have a title  
(taking up all that space at the top of the first page), but have a  
running head at the top of subsequent pages?

I wish I could do this:

   \title [CPTR 331 Fall 2009 Syllabus]{}
   \maketitle

so that I'd still get the headers on pages 2 onward.

I think I answered my own question.  Or at least I did something that  
produced what I was looking for:

\documentclass{amsart}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\usepackage{lastpage}
\begin{document}

\thispagestyle{empty}
\cfoot{Page \thepage\ of \pageref{LastPage}}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}

\begin{center}

\fancyhead{}

Hi Betty

>From your last email, I understand that you have installed TeXLive 2008 but
you have got a TeX file and you do not know how to to latex it for instance,
right? You just need an editor.

My first suggestion would be to try MiKTeX 2.8 because it comes with the
editor (called TeXWorks) and everything is ready to use out of the box. You
can download it from http://miktex.org/2.8/setup. Download and install the
basic version and you should be able to do your work. But I guess you will
need to uninstall TeXLive 2008 before installing MiKTeX 2.8.

My second suggestion is if you do not want to use MiKTeX and want to stay
with TeXLive, you need to install an editor and then configure your editor.
There are lots of TeX editor on the web, so you can actually search and see
which one suits you.

NoTe; TeXLive and MiKTeX are two TeX distributions.

Best wishes,

For example, TeXworks itself, multiplatform (I didn't know MiKTeX was  
distributing TeXworks; that's nice):

http://code.google.com/p/texworks/

Also, TeXnicCenter, Windows only:

http://www.texniccenter.org/

and, multiplatform as well, TeXmaker:

http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/

OK, I followed thes instructions but I still can't seem to get it to work.
As far as I can tell, everything looks good, files are in the right
locations and the filename database is updated as it should. But running

$ pdftex testfont

causes the following error

pdfTeX warning: pdftex (file padb8r): Font padb8r at 600 not found

whereas

$ tex testfont

works fine.

Any further suggestions are most welcom!

best,

As you are using TeXLive 2007, I think updmap should update (or  
create) psfonts_t1.map in /var/lib/texmf/fonts/map/dvips/updmap/ and  
pdftex_dl14.map in /var/lib/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/, with  
information of your added fonts. Does it?

I'm sorry I can't help you, as I don't use TeXLive 2007.

Best,

Axel

Subject: [texhax] need help... two concerns about marginal notes
Message-ID: <20090831022146.42967bt7g8avd5bs@mail.ateneo.net>

Hello!

I need some help again about marginal notes. I am using two-sided book  
class. I have two concerns:

(1) I would like my marginal notes to be right justified for the  
left-hand pages, and left justified for the right-hand pages. No  
hyphenation as well. I think the default is all left justified. What I  
do is to use the following syntax:

\marginpar[\begin{flushright}...\end{flushright}]{\begin{flushleft}...\end{flushleft}}

I do this every time I need to write a marginal note. Is there a  
one-time way to do to avoid this long syntax all the time?

(2) I also noticed that when the marginal note occurred on the first  
line of the page, it is not on the proper side. I have one right-hand  
page wherein the first marginal note (which happens to be on the first  
line) is on the left margin, while the other marginal notes are on the  
right margin. How can this be corrected?

Thank you for your constant help.

Ian June

use \raggedleft instead of flushright and \raggedright instead of flushleft

Depends on your document class. The memoir class can make special tests 
for this. Have a look at the internals of the dlfltxbmarkup package on 
CTAN, it contani a tool from my Danish LaTeX book that does exactly what 
you are looking for, though only for memoir.

Hello, I was wondering if somebody could help with a quick problem.  I am using LaTeX but I think the issue lies with TeX too :-)

When using latex to generate a DVI file, intermediary files (of at least log and aux) are generated.  I do not have any need for these and want to know a command line option or something, which means I don't have to manually delete them every time.

I know the command \nofiles prevents aux files from being generated, but can not find anything to prevent the log file from being generated.

Hopefully somebody here knows the answer
Thanks in advance
Stephen McKeague

I'd love to know too but it seems producing .log file is hardwired in
LaTeX.

Several really useful answers. Now to experiment and choose amongst them.

latex -shell-escape ...

On the other hand it is not a good idea to suppress the aux file, unless
you don't use commands like \label, \ref, \tableofcontents etc.

It's not hardwired into LaTeX. it's hardwired into the basic TeX engine 
on which LaTeX is based., and a TeX engine without a log file could not 
be called TeX.  I don't know which operating system you are using, but 
if it is Microslush, you could add log files to a CClean list and use 
that occasionally.  For myself, I have often been very glad of the 
existence of log files, even though I ignore them most of the time.

I use the Makefile on my linux system. Just a make clean will remove all
aux, log, toc, etc files. The advantage is I can call this from the
editor itself.

I know it is hardwired somewhere ;)

It does not bother me most of the time. The only scenario that I come
across is when I use tikz to produce graphics in .pdf graphs. It will be
very nice to produce the .pdf graph without any intermediary files.

BTW, do you know if .blg file by BibTeX is hardwired or not? Any idea
how to stop it?

First of all, all multiple "aux"-like files are used by LaTeX and
packages in subsequent runs, aux saves information about labels and
equations, theorems, sections actual numbers (and more), .toc is
needed to create table of contents,... Automatically removing such
files definitely does look not right, especially if using \include and
\includeonly mechanism while working on really large document  (say
book).

log files are not used by TeX but they contain different warnings like
multiple defined or undefined labels; LaTeX does not stop on such
failures. So when document is finished, it is a good idea to look into
log file searching for Warning
So, automatic removal of log files does not look right either

Sure, those who keep all tex files in one single directory, these
files contribute to bloody mess but creating separate directory (and
even nested subdirectories if using \include) keeps things under
control

Yes, that shortens it, but I think the point of the question
is more to removing the duplication, as with

\newcommand\mnote[1]{\marginpar[\raggedleft #1\par]{\raggedright #1\par}

I believe the package named mparhack is meant to fix this deficiency.
