    you do not want to have both TeXLive 2007 (from Ubuntu) and TeX Live 
    2008 (from TUG) installed at the same time

Why not have them both installed at the same time?  What does it hurt?
That'd my advice, in general.  Unless there's a disk space issue.

The Ubuntu packages can have Ubuntu LaTeX to satisfy their dependencies,
and you can have TL installed (in /usr/local) for real work.  The TL
install does not interact with the system stuff in any way, unless you
go out of your way to make it do so.

Lars, I'm sure you know this, though, so I'm confused about what you're
saying.

Not knowing anywhere near enough French or Danish to read either
article, I guess I remain ignorant :).

No it is not. E.g. it doesn't use ls-R files and texmf.cnf. The
kpsewich is really only there so that people that read somewhere
about it get some similar results in miktex.

No. Maps have to be added manually to updmap.cfg (which you get by
initemxf --edit-config-file updmap).

that is true, but on many older laptops people do not have enough space 
for two LaTeX dists. And it you don't set the paths right you end up 
with the wrong LaTeX dist.

also, most people do not know about kpsewhich, so they will search their 
systems in a regular way to look for the existence of a specific 
package. And they don't know the difference between the two.

It is both to save space, but also not to confuse. We see more and more 
users (bith Windows, MAC and Linux) that know absolutely nothing about 
computers, so in my opinion, the less confusion (after installation) the 
better.

Hmmm, well, looking at fr-sample.tex,
I see the following :

	\input {BlackCat.picture}

Searching for BlackCat.picture in \TeX\Live\2008
fails to find anything, so I cannot really
advise what (if anything) you should use to
view BlackCat.picture (and its friends) if
indeed you have such a file ...

However, on searching the web, I can find
a BlackCat.picture at :

	http://blogninja.com/doc/texlive-doc/latex/floatrow/

and /it/ contains TeX !  It reads as follows :

> \ifx\pspicture\undefined \begingroup \def\mycircle#1#2#3#4{% \qbezier[#4](0,#1)(#3,#1)(#2,#2)\qbezier[#4](#2,#2)(#1,#3)(#1,0) \qbezier[#4](0,-#1)(#3,-#1)(#2,-#2)\qbezier[#4](#2,-#2)(#1,-#3)(#1,0)} \def\Mycircle#1#2#3#4{\mycircle{#1}{#2}{#3}{#4} \qbezier[#4](0,#1)(-#3,#1)(-#2,#2)\qbezier[#4](-#2,#2)(-#1,#3)(-#1,0) \qbezier[#4](0,-#1)(-#3,-#1)(-#2,-#2)\qbezier[#4](-#2,-#2)(-#1,-#3)(-#1,0)} \begin{picture}(61,103)(0,-15) \put(20,72){\Mycircle{12}{8.485}{4.969}{30}} \put(20,46){\Mycircle{14}{9.898}{5.797}{32}} \put(20,16){\Mycircle{16}{11.313}{6.625}{35}} \put(54,0){ \qbezier[120](0,-8)(-24,-8)(-29.5,0.5) \qbezier[160](0,-14)(-32,-14)(-38.5,0.5)} \put(54,-11){\mycircle{3}{2.121}{1.242}{6}} \put(32,72){\line(0,1){16}}\put(8,72){\line(0,1){16}} \put(32,88){\qbezier[20](0,0)(-2.877,-2.877)(-5.754,-5.754)} \put(8,88){\qbezier[20](0,0)(2.877,-2.877)(5.754,-5.754)} \end{picture}% \endgroup \else \begin{pspicture}(0,0)(61,103) \psset{linewidth=.125,linestyle=none,fillstyle=solid,fill

and therefore looks as if it is using LaTeX commands
to /draw/ a picture rather than being a picture per se.

Let me know if this helps, and in the meantime I will
copy the TeX-Live team to see if I can find out where
BlackCat.Picture has gone from TeX Live 2008.

another reason that comes to mind:

A users is a TUG member that have therefore installed TeX Lvie 2008, 
perhaps using the DVD.

Now this user would like to use the TeXMaker editor, but ubuntu also 
want to install LaTeX in order for you to install TeXMaker, which might 
increase the download to several hundred Mb, that does not make sense.

In any case I wonder a bit why the ubuntu packages is packaged they way 
they are. Yes, you need LaTeX for TeXMaker to make sense, but not to 
just start the program.

Actually, I didn't know about floatrow until Philip Ratcliffe  
mentioned it in TeXhax ---I think it's quite impressive, but  
unfortunately I don't have the time right now to learn it.

Yes, I was not considering that \llap{\kern1em} in the definition of
\myparagraph added glue before the beginning of every \myparagraph, so the
presence of \nobreak just there would make TeX choose different page breakings.

I modified that definition eliminating \llap{\kern1em} and putting some \vskip
instead.  This way, the presence of \nobreak does not change TeX choice of
where to break the page.

I need \nobreak in order to use the pdftex \pdfdest command: without \nobreak
there are troubles.

Thanks for help

Dear TUG Support,
?
I am trying to install and then hopefully use LATEX.
?
I initially went through the document created by Thomas Feuerstack named "The Quickest Way to a TEX System". It is a very carefully prepared document and installation seems very straight-forward when reading the document. 
I realized that I need a "ProText Distribution" which should be available in the "Tex Collection DVD". 
I became a TUG Member recently and I do not have a "Tex Collection DVD" . 
?
In the Members Site (https://www.tug.org/members/) I read the following:
?
CTAN is updated constantly with new uploads. However, it's not simple to extract the CTAN subset which is on the TeX Collection DVD. So here is the snapshot of CTAN as a tar file (2.9gb).
?
I downloaded the snapshot which took me 7hours and 45 minutes...
and unzipped it.
?
Reading through Thomas Feuerstack's "The Quickest Way to a TEX System", I see that I have to install MIKTEX, TEXNIC CENTER, GHOSTSCRIPT AND GSVIEW in order. However, when I unzipped the above snapshot, I saw that there are hundreds of zipped and unzipped files and I do not know where to start.
?
I would like to install Latex and start using it as soon as possible.
I would most appreciate if you can help me.
May be I needed to download something else...
?
I have been in the software business using the Oracle Database, SQL and PL/SQL for nearly twenty-years. I am familiar with software and installation. In this case, I do not know where to start, and which files to use.
I am hoping that I will get help? from TUG Support to start me off.
Thanks very much for your help in advance.

Message-ID: <710167.67280.qm@web43411.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>


Hi all,

I am writing a class for my dissertation and I have a couple of questions:

I am using the geometry package for the margins and I've noticed that the
top margin is with respect to the midline (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_line).
Is this the correct behavior or have I done something wrong?
This is what I have:
\RequirePackage[letterpaper,vmargin=1in,hmargin=1in,bindingoffset=0.5in,
includeheadfoot,nohead,foot=3\baselineskip]{geometry}

The other problem is that chapter headings need to be 1in below the top margin.
I've redefined the \makechapterhead to add a \vspace*{1in} but the space that
is added is more than that, specifically 1 3/16" and goes to 1 1/4" if I use the
setspace package and doublespace the document.

I'd like to make the class file in a way that others can use and avoid hacks and
arbitrary lengths to fit my document. I am using pdflatex and the latest texlive 
(updated with tlmgr) in Debian.

Thanks

d

You will, believe me. And you won't regret the time spent.

I'm, like you, a TUG member. But let me tell you that you don't have  
to be a TUG member to ask for support, and neither have to give your  
TUG user name. Being a TUG member has many benefits, but support is  
for everyone.

I don't use proTeXt (MiKTeX et al.), nor Windows ---so, please,  
Windows TeXers, correct me if I'm wrong---, but I'm afraid you didn't  
have to download the whole CTAN snapshot; here

http://www.tug.org/protext/

you can download just proTeXt. Maybe you already have it ---I don't  
know what's in the CTAN snapshot; so check your download first. Also,  
I don't know how it is now, but a few years ago I saw a proTeXt  
installation and it was really simple.

Please post to this list any further question you have ---many people  
will be glad to help you.

Best regards,

Axel

No, I don't think that's wrong per se, but you won't find universal  
agreement on that either. Just take a look at the really amazing  
memoir class manual ---in your terminal or Command Prompt,

texdoc memoir

The first part is one of the best works on the art of typography one  
can read.

Building a class yourself I think requires an extraordinary amount of  
time and effort you can avoid using a pre-configured class that  
closely suits your needs and adapting it with packages like geometry,  
fancyhdrs, titlesec, etc.; or maybe you would like to use the memoir  
class itself, which, though I've never used it, I understand is very  
configurable.

Best,

Axel

You will, believe me. And you won't regret the time spent.

I'm, like you, a TUG member. But let me tell you that you don't have to be a TUG member to ask for support, and neither have to give your TUG user name. Being a TUG member has many benefits, but support is for everyone.

I don't use proTeXt (MiKTeX et al.), nor Windows ---so, please, Windows TeXers, correct me if I'm wrong---, but I'm afraid you didn't have to download the whole CTAN snapshot; here

http://www.tug.org/protext/

you can download just proTeXt. Maybe you already have it ---I don't know what's in the CTAN snapshot; so check your download first. Also, I don't know how it is now, but a few years ago I saw a proTeXt installation and it was really simple.

Please post to this list any further question you have ---many people will be glad to help you.

Best regards,

Axel

To install miktex 

http://docs.miktex.org/manual/installing.html

(I always use the basic installer, I install miktex on my account as
single user, then get the cm-super fonts with the package manager
and get the rest of the packages I need on-the-fly).

I don't have texniccenter (I'm using winedt), but I would simply
follow the instructions on http://www.texniccenter.org/ to install
it.

Ghostscript isn't really necessary as a start, but if you want it:

http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/

Install ghostscript first, then gsview. It is a simple, standard
windows installation.

Hello Dicle,

Although proTeXt does have various bits and pieces "pre-bundled", I
would suggest getting MiKTeX directly (http://www.miktex.org). MiKTeX is
the standard TeX distribution on Windows, and the bits that proTeXt adds
are not necessarily that useful. For editing LaTeX files, I would
suggest TeXworks (http://www.texworks.org) as the easiest editor to use,
although it does not yet have an installation program.

I actually based my class on the report one using 7-8 other packages. I've 
implemented everything in 400 lines of code more or less and about half of 
that is new environments (for the frontmatter). I should have checked the
margins more closely earlier. I took a quick look at the memoir class before 
starting but the documentation for it was huge and I would still need to do 
under the hood changes because of some weird formatting rules. I will take 
a second look nonentheless to see what they've done.

Thanks

No, I don't think that's wrong per se, but you won't find universal  
agreement on that either. Just take a look at the really amazing  
memoir class manual ---in your terminal or Command Prompt,

texdoc memoir

The first part is one of the best works on the art of typography one  
can read.

Building a class yourself I think requires an extraordinary amount of  
time and effort you can avoid using a pre-configured class that  
closely suits your needs and adapting it with packages like geometry,  
fancyhdrs, titlesec, etc.; or maybe you would like to use the memoir  
class itself, which, though I've never used it, I understand is very  
configurable.

Best,

Axel

memoir is fairly easy to use and base other classes uppon, when one get 
a hang of it.

If there are any problems just ask (and yes I know the manual may be a 
little hard to comprehend at times)

see that Blue Sky has upgraded to OS X with version 2.1 but I can't

Message-ID: <27C8DC2F-4442-4290-84CD-8D6D7E6D9215@norvelle.org>

Greetings all,

I am currently looking at ways of integrating the functionality of the  
Biblatex package (a natbib/jurabib replacement) into the latex2rtf  
project.  Specifically, I would like to take advantage of the powerful  
bibliography and citation formatting capacities that Biblatex offers,  
without re-implementing the entire Biblatex package in C (which is how  
latex2rtf currently emulates natbib and jurabib capabilities).

What I would like to do is be able to run a LaTeX interpreter on my  
TeX file, but instead of producing a PDF/DVI output, it would produce  
another LaTeX output, which I can then capture in order to extract the  
formatted citations and the bibliography.  As things currently stand,  
Biblatex does not produce a file with a formatted bibliography or  
citations, but produces all of these on the fly, during the process of  
producing the PDF/DVI output.  As a result, there are no left over aux- 
type files that contain the information that I need.

Basically, what I need is some way to complete "expand" a typical  
LaTeX file into something more basic, even raw TeX, if that were the  
only option.  So far, however, I have not found anything.  All of the  
engines I am familiar with produce some other kind of output (PDF,  
DVI, HTML, etc.).  I've spend a good amount of time search online and  
reading manuals, and so far have come up empty-handed.

Is what I am looking for possible?  Thanks for any help you can offer.

I suspect the reason for the lack of information is that TeX has moved
on a lot since the hey-day of Textures.  Modern TeX distributions tend
to work very well, and I suspect most people don't see that paying money
gains them much.

I suppose that if LuaTeX's kpse primitives should work on MikTeX as on
other systems, then Christian has mo make sure that his library does
exactly the same as Karl's, one way or another.

Good to know too.  At the moment I'm revising the VnTeX
documentation.  Seems that I don't have to change this section.

When other people commented that you could have downloaded protext 
or miktex alone, they were of course right, but you shouldn't
need to download them separately now that you have downloaded
a whole ctan snapshot.

(CTAN home)\tex-archive\systems\win32\protext\ProTeXt-2.2-071608.exe

That is a big self-extracting zip file that you can run as an installer
(or burn to a CD).

I suspect (but am not sure) that what comes out after unzipping is 
the distribution CD contents, and you need to then run Setup.exe
as the *real* installer.

Look for protext-install-en.pdf within the unzipped contents, or
get it separately:
   ftp://tug.org/tex/protext/Install/protext-install-en.pdf
anf let that guide you through the installation.

Good luck.

The "CTAN snapshot" is the content of CTAN, with most files which are
in TeX Live already, removed.  This snapshot is shipped along with
some TeX distributions on the TeX Collection DVD.  It doesn't contain
any TeX distributions itself.

I cannot find a longer version of \rightsquigarrow out there including
Scott Pakin's comprehensive symbols list
The combination --- squiggle arrow head would be just right, that is a
linear extension of the left hand side of the symbol would be perfect
for my requirements, eg:

\begin{equation*}

I would suggest looking at the mhchem package. It has a lot of "chemical
sense" and handles this type of thing easily:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[version=3]{mhchem}
\begin{document}
\ce{HCCH ->[\ce{$\dot{\mathrm{O}}$H}] $\dot{\mathrm{C}}$CH(OH)
  ->[\ce{$\dot{\mathrm{H}}$}] H2CH(OH)}

\end{document}

Hello Sir,
   Firstly, be sure you are using the url package or equivalent. Secondly,
be sure to escape all special characters: % in this case, which is LaTeX's
comment character. Try this:

This is a test.\footnote{\url{
http://www.teledyne-si.com/infrared_visible_fpas/Teledyne
\%20Imaging\%20Sensor\%20-\%20Infrared\%20SPIE\%20Paper\%20_7021-20_.pdf}}

where you will note I preceded each % with a backslash.

Happy TeXing!

OK, sorry for my answer yesterday.  It seems that protext is not included

Let me don my mind-reading helmet.  You are using hyperref, right?

Then you need to put \urldef in the preamble BETWEEN loading url and
hyperref:

\usepackage{url}
\urldef\fancy\url{http://www.teledyne-si.com/infrared_visible_fpas/Teledyne%20Imaging%20Sensor%20-%20Infrared%20SPIE%20Paper%20_7021-20_.pdf}

Both  _ and % in the url link need to be escaped with a \

The file tcilatex.tex is part od the Scientific Word distribution and
is not included in any TeX distribution. ?There are two possibilities.

1) Ask the Scientific Word user to export (or save) the file as
portable LaTeX. ? You may need to install some unusual LaTeX packages
but this should work.

2) Alternatively simply comment out the instruction to include the
file. ?This has worked for me in some simpler documents.

In debian you can tell apt not to install automatically recommended or
suggested dependencies by adding lines to apt.conf 

$sudo -e /etc/apt/apt.conf

// Disable Recommended and suggested packages
APT::Install-Recommends "0";
APT::Install-Suggests "0";

Then texmaker will be installed without texlive from repository.  That
should also applied to ubuntu too.

Subject: [texhax] ASU Thesis/Dissertation Style File
Message-ID: <39BF1F21-9A26-4C50-884E-A2A1311D5F13@asu.edu>

Hi guys,

I'm completing my thesis for a Masters at ASU (Arizona State  
University) and I'm using LaTeX.  I am using an old style file  
asthesis.sty that John Jones wrote in 1998.  The version I have is  
April 2001 (version 1.11).

Unfortunately, some ignoramus at ASU posted the following (below) in  
May of 2005 so I haven't heard of anyone updating that style file  
since.  ASU's complete ignorance about LaTeX baffles me, though.   
Anyway, I'm obviously ignoring them hoping I can get the format  
correct and not have to use crappy WORD!!   So if anyone has a recent  
version of this style file (that will follow the latest Format Manual  
from ASU), I'd love it if you shared it :D  But if no one replies, I  
will have to send requests to texhax for help to fix format errors  
the graduate college will whine about.

--------------------
Due to continued formatting errors associated with the style-file  
LaTeX, the Format Advising Service does not recommend that students  
continue to use it as a style guide.

LaTeX, developed by a former ASU student, is available only on his  
personal website and is based on an outdated version of the Format  
Manual. The format of theses and dissertations has changed since its  
development, and LaTeX no longer meets the basic requirements of a  
recommended style guide. The check-box option for LaTeX has been  
removed from the Format Approval Sheet, and students are encouraged  
to use other style guides such as APA, MLA, Chicago, Turabian, or a  
field-specific journal article.
--------------------

Thanks so much!

Sharon

The problem with the statement they made is that they think that  
LaTeX is a ``style guide" (like APA or MLA http://en.wikipedia.org/ 
wiki/Style_guide) when it is a typesetting language, a completely  
different thing.

As an example, let's say Microsoft Word was not the popular software  
that it is (and it was not well-known), and let's say someone wrote a  
Word template (following some of ASU's Thesis formatting requests,  
but not all because it was outdated), and let's say many people were  
beginning to submit their thesis using this outdated Word template.   
Of course their formatting was wrong, but it is not Word's fault  
their formatting is wrong, it's the template that needs to be changed  
to accommodate the new format requirements.  However, in this case,  
ASU would say you can no longer use Word because it doesn't meet the  
requirements of a style guide.  That makes no sense because Word is  
not a style guide.  In the case of the LaTeX style file, the  
asthesis.sty file was not continuously maintained to allow for  
changes in ASU's ever-changing format requirements, but that is not  
LaTeX's fault, it's the style-file that needs to be updated to  
accommodate ASU's format requirements.  I hope that made sense.

Anyway, I am currently using the asthesis.sty file (with hopes I can  
get help from texhax to make the necessary changes to fix any  
formatting issues), and I'm also using the apacite package which  
allows me to use the APA style.  I am in the Linguistics field so I'm  
also using several other packages for printing IPA (International  
Phonetic Alphabet) characters.

>> LaTeX, developed by a former ASU student, 

So according to them LaTeX was developed in ASU! 

Anyway many universities are clueless when it comes to preparing a document. I'm in engineering and we were told to avoid latex because it creates many problems and it is difficult to consistently follow the formatting requirements! Of course when the requirement is to *put a 1" space between the top margin and the header by pressing enter 5 times* it goes to show that the formatting guide was prepared by clueless people for clueless people. Similarly doublespacing, left aligned text or one font size for all headers and body text seem to be leftovers from the age of typewriters.

If the formatting hasn't changed significantly then this is the best course of action. Otherwise I've found that it is difficult to edit old class files. In my case I found 3 that were 6 to 12 years old but with no comments and a lot of hacks it was really difficult to bring them up to date. An alternative is to use a class that allows heavy customization like memoir. Personally I picked the report class, made some environments for the frontmatter and used some packages like geometry, tocloft, fancyref to finetune formatting.

Purely in the interest of airing grievances,
I had a similar problem in my college senior design course. Our papers had
to adhere to the AIAA formatting guidelines. Naturally, I looked for (and
found) an AIAA LaTeX class on their website and used it in typesetting my
first paper. And then my professor complained that my paper was formatted
incorrectly. As it turns out, the style file on the AIAA website was out of
date, but if you can't trust the Official style file on the Official
website, what can you trust?

More relevantly, I was able to edit the LaTeX and BibTeX files to get the
formatting I wanted, but it wasn't easy (and required a lot of help from
this mailing list!), so if you do happen to get it working, please donate it
to the school or post it somewhere so that society may benefit.

Good Luck!

AFAIR tcilatex.tex is some special code included in Scientific Word. I'm 
not quite sure if LaTeX-Code produced bei Scientific Word is compatible 
  with MiKTeX (and every other "normal" TeX-distribution).

Back in the dark ages my school had a policy prohibiting theses done
with dot-matrix printers.  Then someone told someone on the committee
how laser printers worked, and then laser printers were prohibited as
well since they used lots of tiny dots.

Message-ID: <BDA385421B444C8988D0810748DF3E61@randy9b4f288eb>

Hello Sir -

As an example I am trying to make an 8" by 4"  rectangular box centered 
horizontally in an
8.5'' by 11'' paper using TEX
To do this I set horizontal borders of 0'' and vertical borders of /5" then 
I use the command,
\centerline{\bx{\vtop to4in{\hsize=8in\parindent=0pt}\vrule width8in 
height0pt depth0pt}},
where \bx simply places a box around its argument.
Though this is not the main point of my question, if you have any 
suggestions with regard to my
code them please advise.

What appears on my YAP previewer is different from what I get when I print 
the document.
When I print the document it comes back with the correct dimensions and is 
perfectly horizontally centered.
What YAP shows is a rectangle of slightly bigger dimensions and, instead of 
being centered, the rectangle
is shifted  completely to the right.edge of my paper.

Somehow YAP is not configured to be perfectly synchronized.  How can I 
correct this?  If this is not your area of expertise
then please help me by suggesting who might better be able to answer my 
question,

Message-ID: <49D9E18E.5070802@uni.torun.pl>

           Dear GUST and BachoTeX Friends!

BachoTeX 2009 is mercilessly coming (http://gust.org.pl/bachotex/2009) :-)

We were able to negotiate an extension of the deadline to give the final 
numbers of the participants with the net effect to have the (well, not 
so) early-bird-registrations
date to become now April 13th, Easter Monday, until midnight.

 From the conference page the following links are available:
-- payments info (behind the "Fees" link),
-- the registration form,
-- the current list of presentations (there are some abstracts 
translations missing;    work is under way),
-- the schedule framework (behind "Schedule").

Please note the following interesting events:
-- typography counseling (typographers present at the conference will 
look at your    works and will give invaluable advice -- please use the 
chance!),
-- the already traditional TeX Clinic 
(http://gust.org.pl/projects/klinika),
-- the opportunity to present your small works or samples at poster 
session stands;
   time will be allocated to discuss them informally with other attendees,
-- BoF sessions on topics which surely will emerge during the conference,
-- a series of panel discussions:
   * TeX: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (i.e., SWOT 
analysis),
   * TeX: at a turning point, or at the crossroads?,
   * TeX distributions,
-- the 2009 TeX Pearls session (http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls),
-- and, of course, singing and having some merry time at the bonfires or 
inside the huts.

I also remind GUST members of the 2009 GUST Annual General meeting 
(April 30th, Thursday, http://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2009/agm.html).

Please come, bring your families with you, and enjoy the perhaps last 
chance to experience BachoTeX at Bachotek, as the Nicolas Copernicus 
University seems to be trying to sell the place, as today's (April 6th, 
2009) local papers have it in their headlines :-(

Waiting for you!

(resend, apologise if duplicated)

I installed texlive 2008 from tug and then installed dblatex. When
trying to convert a file from docbook to pdf, it complained,

Document Class: article 2005/09/16 v1.4f Standard LaTeX document class

Actually that docbook.sty is located inside another place

/usr/local/share/dblatex/latex/style/docbook.sty

How to configure so that it also use sty outside /usr/local/texlive/2008 ?

Message-ID: <200904062144.n36Lifgn011948@manaus.ic.unicamp.br>


Hello,

I need to create a LaTeX style for technical report covers. The cover
is to show the institution's logo, which exists only in bitmap form.

Normally I would provide the user with two files, the "report.sty" and
a "logo.eps" file. However, life would be simpler for users if they
had only one file to download.

So, is there a way to include the image pixel data (or the contents of
the "logo.eps" file) in the "report.sty" file itself? Say, within a
largish "\special" command?

Thanks, and all the best,

Subject: [texhax] URGENT: Will Pay for Written Style File
Message-ID: <200904071334.n37DYMc20428@tug.org>

Hello All,

I really need help because I don't know the first thing about writing  
a style file.

I am willing to pay for someone to write a style file from scratch to  
meet format guidelines of ASU's Thesis/Dissertation.  (Can send a PDF
of the format rules).

I need a rough draft of the style file to use by Wednesday and then a  
final maybe week later.

I can provide the old asthesis.sty for reference and I can provide  
the draft of my thesis for checking if the format is correct.

Please email me if you are able to help me.  I don't have a lot of  
time... This Thursday I have to submit the draft for format approval  
which will likely need revisions of format resubmitted a couple of  
weeks later.

If no one responds, I will have to convert my thesis to Word,  
*aaahhh* and that will not be good...

My appreciation,

Sharon

Subject: [texhax] Anyone using ledpar?
Message-ID: <5E976FB1-267A-4942-B797-63AEC9EA6EA8@telecom-bretagne.eu>

I need to typeset parallel texts with critical apparatus. The package  
parallel works fine for parallel texts but it processes footnotes at  
then end of each paragraph, and that will often be the wrong page. The  
package ledpar is advertizing exactly this: parallel texts with  
critical apparati and footnotes.

When I tried it, nothing worked... EIther the documentation is wrong,  
or ledpar is vaporware. I wrote:

\begin{pairs}
\begin{Leftside} ... left side text ... \end{Leftside}
\begin{Rightside} ... right side text ... \end{Rightside}
\Columns
\end{pairs}

as written in the manual, and I got both texts in a *single* column  
(instead of two columns). Only when I inserted the command \stanza  
(taken from ledmac and normally used only for poetry, which is not my  
case) in the (Left|Right)side environments I got two columns (but also  
a bunch of error messages). Up to that point the result is satisfying.  
But footnotes do *not work at all*, they remain inside the text.

Has anyone used ledpar with parallel texts *and* footnotes and  
critical apparatus? I would be very curious to see an example that  
works.

Any other idea about how to solve that problem? It is quite tricky  
since vertical material is added on both columns as well as from the  
bottom (footnotes etc.).

Thanks in advance

Yannis

PS. I attach a small test file, illustrating the error messages and  
the failure of footnote.

You might try lookng at the "filecontents" package.

Yes, you can do this.  Make a postscript version of the logo, and then
you can use a \special command to encapsulate it.  I got a file like
this from kluwer a few years ago, and have also used the same trick for
clients since for exactly the reason you suggest, to make it easier on them.

The kluwer file I think you can find by googling kluwer.cls.  The
beginning of the relevant section looks like this:

\logotoks={\special{"
4 4 translate
989 1138 1 [60 0 0 -60 210 930]
currentfile
/ASCII85Decode filter

The downside is you are stuck with the tex->dvips->ps2pdf route. (I
think -- someone else will correct me if I'm wrong.)  I imagine there is
some similar trick for pdftex->pdf, but I haven't messed with that.

This is just an idea and maybe I have misunderstood your request but I know
you can use Inkscape to export an .EPS file using the PS tricks macros.

So instead of having to send both files, you can send one .tex file with the
Inkscape output...

Just an idea.

As another random idea, perhaps there's a way to embed a metapost image
within a latex file. I don't use metapost, but I know that it is used
mainly to generate separate .mbs files that get included with
includegraphics, but perhaps there is a trick to use them in the same
way inside a special. The potential advantage is that .mbs files are
"purified" eps that can be understood by pdflatex as well as dvips. [I
don't know if it is possible to use \special at all in pdflatex,
though.]

I mention this because the flowchart software Dia, freely available,
multi-platform ..., will import a bitmap image and export it as an mbs.
The one example I tried it looks like it simply has a draw command for
each pixel in the bitmap.

This will require a metapost guru and pdflatex guru, but I thought it
sufficiently off-the-wall that it might point to something useable.

Sharon,

First thing, stop panicking.

Second thing, creating a style file "from scratch" is not trivial and  
it is very unlikely anyone could do it in that time.

Third thing, what's wrong with the current thesis style? What needs  
changing? There are those on this list that could assist with various  
changes if required I am sure, but...

Fourth thing, you need to be more specific about what you want done.  
Don't people to respond because you are jumping up and down.

Fifth thing, why not post a link to the pdf so others can assist, if  
they can? So far you have made it difficult for others to help you.

Sixth and final thing, umm do you really think threatening to convert  
it to Word will elicit more urgency in peoples' responses?

Normally I would just make a directory and zip that up.  But there is
an interesting feature of LaTeX described on page 77 of Lamport's
book.  Before the \documentclass command you can put these things:

\begin{filecontents}{name.tex}
contents of file
\end{filecontents}

The file name.tex gets written out!

I tried it:

\begin{filecontents}{name.tex}
contents of file
\end{filecontents}
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
Test of filecontents 
\input{name.tex}
\end{document}

LaTeX says:

LaTeX Warning: Writing file `./name.tex'.

8-O it worked!! 8^D

This is the file written:

%% LaTeX2e file `name.tex'
%% generated by the `filecontents' environment
%% from source `paper' on 2009/04/07.
%%
contents of file

This really appeared in the LaTeX output!

The second time it says:

LaTeX Warning: File `name.tex' already exists on the system.
               Not generating it from this source.

I was then able to create an eps from the LaTeX source and read it in.
to create a graphic.  Unfortunately the file created has to be in the
current directory, if I write to /tmp/filename it tries to put it in
./tmp/filename.

So there is a residue left wherever one runs the LaTeX.

I've attached the example.  I have not tried to put it in a style
file.

	I recommend to use docstrip to ship the class and the
associated class within a unique file that can be used to reconstruct
the original files (including an eps version of the logotype) on the
user computer. See [1] if this solution fits you.

Greetings Sharon!

Extending off what Alan said, it may help if you can include the
existing style file (mentioned in your previous email).

In fact I just dug out your previous email:

Now, the above is clearly written by a person ignorant about LaTeX,
however it does say that you can use styles such as APA, MLA, etc
which I know there are style files for... Why don't you use those?

You may also want to get in contact with this ``Format Advising
Service'' and explain LaTeX to them.

Also, if you're worried about deadlines, you should probably try to
get in contact with the relevant faculty members at your university
and explain that your having technical difficulties. I'm not in
Academia, but I'd hope that they'd be understanding....

It seems likely that someone will help you, but it may take some time.

Best of luck!

Christopher

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20090408090843.0274c9e0@pop3.web.de>

Sorry, I cannot go deep into the matter right now (like analysing the sample).

I know ledpar only from discussion with Peter Wilson, and I believe that it 
works.

Unfortunately, Peter Wilson has quit maintenance of the package, but 
perhaps he is willing to send you his test file that convinced him that it 
worked.

There might be an alternative with *ednotes* instead of ledmac ... (I could 
write a "ledmac-style interface" for ednotes ...) One ednotes user managed 
to use parallel.sty at the same time, but complained that it was hard work 
with Perl. And I saw a forum discussion about using parallel.sty with 
lineno.sty (again, it was not straightforward), which gives some hope for 
ednotes as well ... I am looking for sponsors so I could clear up the 
matter ...

Good luck,

     Uwe.

One more thought: are any of the people who passed the relevant degree
programme last year still around?  It could be that one of them has
already solved your problem, particularly if you're in (or have
contacts in) a department where it's common to have a lot of
mathematical content in dissertations.

at our University we just got a new logo made of two letters from a 
special 'graphical' font. Instead of installing a font just to use two 
letters I just traced it using tikz, no-one can see the difference, so 
now I don't have to distribute an extra font or some graphics containing 
the logo in all needed colors.

I'd be interested in seeing the PDF of the format rules (couldn't find  
it by searching on-line).

Have you tried to look over and compare them to the style file to see  
what the discrepancies are?

You can find it here.  I had attached it to the very first email, but  
the admin had to delete it because he thought it might be too large  
and might not get to some of your inboxes.  My apologies for that.  I  
realized later I should have included the link.

Thanks.

Looking at it, it's kind of hard to take seriously given that it  
includes bad links like:

http://graduate.asu.edu/format/UsingStlGds.html

(apparently that should be http://graduate.asu.edu/recstyleguides.html )


Which begs the question of what your major of study is.

especially when one of the bad links is to:

http://graduate.asu.edu/format/FMchanges.html

Rather seems important for that to be up-to-date.

Also when it has contradictions like:

``You cannot rely on other theses and dissertations?whether
library or departmental copies?to format your document.
Someone else?s document is not an acceptable style guide.''

Yet they suggest when using a style guide from a journal to sample an  
article and provide that as an example.

I suspect that just adding \usepackage{mathptmx} will get one most of  
the way there --- certainly it'll change the look sufficiently that  
they won't realize that it was done using LaTeX.

Well there you have it.  I didn't mind the whole thesis writing process (I'm
in the Applied Linguistics Masters program), but I really do loathe that I
have to go through this stupid, idiotic format approval.  This has been the
worst part of my ASU experience, knowing that I have to follow guidelines
that are completely absurd.

Well you should be able to use the APA style then:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/apa/

or MLA:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mla-paper/

I'm sure that if you just use whichever of the above is the best fit  
and add \usepackage{mathptmx} and tell them it was formatted in the  
appropriate size of ``Times New Roman'' you'll at least get far enough  
for them to give you specific feedback on what needs to be changed.

(Seems to me if they're going to say other styles are acceptable, but  
the ASU formatting rules over-ride then they should have a list of  
what the exceptions are for each style)

At one time, each of them had a meaning and purpose, and probably they  
intend for them still to have a purpose, but it's lost in ignorant  
tradition.

Good luck!

Please look into "texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf".  The comments in this file
are quite useful.  You probably have to add the path to docbook.sty
there.  However, the TeX Live manaul provides some useful
information too.  And if you type "info kpathsea" on the command line,
you'll get some invaluable information about how this quite complex
TeX system works. 

Whenever you add a new file, you also have to run "texhash" in order
to update the file database.

Regards,
  Reinhard

thanks for your answer. The question is: if I use parallel.sty  
together with ednotes.sty, will footnotes be processed at environment  
end or when the footnotes actually appear? That's the only problem I  
have with parallel, otherwise it works just fine.

Subject: [texhax] using align, array, eqnarry within tabular environment
Message-ID: <101422.19804.qm@web39703.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


Hi list,

I have a question regarding the use of align, array, or eqnarray within a table created by tabular. Align works fine by itself, or within a minipage. For example:

===================================
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}

 \begin{align*}
      x \protect & = y+1  \\
      z \protect & = 2 x
   \end{align*} 

\end{document}
===================================

However, the following (- align nested within tabular -) gives
! LaTeX Error: \begin{document} ended by \end{tabular}.
! Missing $ inserted.
and so on...
===================================
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
   \begin{minipage}{2in}
     \flushleft text
   \end{minipage} &
     \begin{align*}
       x & = y+1  \\
       z & = 2 x
   \end{align*} 
 \end{tabular}
 
\end{document}
==================================

Even if I try to put \protect in front of & and \\, it still has problems, and putting 
\protect{\begin{align*}...\end{align*}}
will put the statement on the next line rather than in the second column of the table, as I desire.

Does anyone know how to get around this behavior? Thanks very much in advance,

Stephen

1. Try parallel with ordinary footnotes. ednotes uses manyfoot for the 
critical apparatus, and manyfoot's footnotes go just to where ordinary 
footnotes go. Does anybody else know from experience?

2. Google for `Quod nihil scitur forsan', you find a page of a parallel 
Latin-German edition of Franciscus Sanchez' text. Scroll to the bottom of 
the page: There are critical footnotes. As I understood Sergei Mariev who 
made the Latin text this was made with ednotes and parallel. But I am 
asking him for confirmation.

I am also suggesting this googling because I find the design interesting.

The book is the last item of www.webdesign-bu.de/uwe_lueck/ednworks.html 
where you find additional information (in English) about it.

All the best,

     Uwe.

Thank you for the pointer.  That info kpathsea needs some time to
digest.

Hello,

I am using "cuted" style to generate my one column maketitle in a two

Anyone have an idea ?

      \begin{tabular}{cc}
       \begin{minipage}{2in}

           z & = 2 x
       \end{align*} 
     \end{tabular}
     
    \end{document}
    ==================================
    
    Even if I try to put \protect in front of & and \\, it still has problems, and putting 
    \protect{\begin{align*}...\end{align*}}
    will put the statement on the next line rather than in the second column of the table, as I desire.

    Does anyone know how to get around this behavior? Thanks very much in advance,

the align environment works only at "outer" level
(which can be directly within a minipage); it
cannot be used within any other environment,
particularly within another display environment.
instead, use the aligned environment:

    ===================================
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{amsmath}
    \begin{document}
      \begin{tabular}{cc}
       \begin{minipage}{2in}
         \flushleft text
       \end{minipage} &
         $\begin{aligned}
           x & = y+1  \\
           z & = 2 x
       \end{aligned}$
     \end{tabular}
     
    \end{document}
    ==================================

see the section on "alignment building blocks" in
the amsmath user's guide (amsldoc.pdf), p.7.
  
any of these subsidiary environments must be
in math mode.

     Vaporware? The documentation includes three complete examples, two 
of which were provided by a user.

     I have attached a corrected and extended version of your test file. 
I don't see how you expect things to work if you can't spell macro names 
correctly and miss out some required macros, like \beginnumbering. It's 
a pity that you did not read the documentation more carefully, examine 
the examples and attempt to understand the error messages.

     In the future consider that the fault might lie with you.

Goodbye
Peter W.

I sincerely (and publicly) apolodgidze for the term "vaporware", it  
was impolite and stupid of me.

In your documentation (of ledpar) you say that it suffices to write

\begin{Leftside}
...
\end{Leftside}

\begin{Rightside}
...
\end{Rightside}
\Columns

to obtain two columns. This is *not* the case, since I obtain only one  
column, and this time I'm sure that there is no error in the  
environment and macro names.

I obtained two columns by adding the \stanza command, and this one is  
not mentioned in the ledpar documentation but in the one of ledmac.  
And this command also produces a bunch of error messages (and this is  
the reason why I didn't detected the error in the footnote macro name).

Mea culpa for the error in the footnote macro name. But you must admit  
that something is missing in the ledpar documentation, however  
carefully I read it.

Sorry again for offending you, it wasn't my intention.

This "behaviour" is, I believe, by design: align and co are display
environments and are not meant to be put inside boxes (as are used in
constructing tabes and arrays).  You might try either normal math blocks and
\displaystyle, as in $\displaystyle x=1$ or put the align environment inside
a minipage.

Cheers,   Phil

Hi Phil, thank you for the response! Yes, so it is not of my doing...

But align within minipage still does not work for me - I get too many } or & error in that case.

Since yesterday I have found that I can get it to work with a series of equations with $$ within tabular
\begin{tabular}{c}
$eqn1$ \\
$eqn2$
\end{tabular}
or even with an array environment within an equation environment within minipage with \tabularnewline, within tabular.

Is there perhaps an equivalent replacement for & as there is for \\ with \tabularnewline that you (or the list) know of?

Thanks again,

Stephen

Of course you can't take this seriously.

ASU is (IMHO) a company with 3000 employes and a budget of 500 Million
US$, serving 67000 students. The main work these 70000 people do is
writing texts (homework, articles, thesis, books, ...).

And this company doesn't care about the tools these people use for
that, since
- the format manual is written in Illustrator(!) with Helvetica.
  Obviously no money is spend for CI. And the College of Design is
  either run by idiots ("reputedly rigorous and highly ranked") or has
  been ignored
- it seems no money is spend supporting the tools used mostly in the
  university (be it Word, OO or LaTeX). I expect a company as this to
  have at least a dozen full time (La)TeX supporters and at least one
  full time (La)TeX programmer.

Btw: I count three Colleges of Teacher Education and Leadership and
one School of Journalism and Mass Communication in the wikipedia
article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University). I
shudder when I think what these graduates learn about text writing
tools.

Sorry for the rant.

Sharon, please check this manual with someone from the Design college.

I contacted a student in the math department to find out if any graduates in
the math department had successfully used LaTeX and had a valid style file
and he is in my same boat along with his colleagues.  They are trying to use
LaTeX for their dissertations.  They are now waiting for format approval
from the Graduate College.... but he is not sure their style file is right.
This goes to show that ASU's ignorance about LaTeX is stifling its own
graduates.

About checking with someone from the design college, I'm not sure I
understand...

Well, the design college seems mostly to be architecture, but still:
The design of the manual (and the design it promotes) should make
anybody who teaches design angry. And I just hope that the college has
somebody who knows something about typography. Check with the chair
for Graphic Design.

Sorry, forget that college: This
http://design.asu.edu/msd/documents/FlowThesis.pdf is the
documentation of their MSc(!) in Design. :-(

Btw: I really wonder what students of the School of Human
Communication learn - apparently NOT basic Typography (i.e.
communication your ideas effectively in writing).

Good luck
   Martin

I believe that's only the title page --- the balance of the document  
looks to've been written w/ MS Word, but it was assembled from  
multiple pieces, so the metadata for the document is that of the title  
page.

You need the T1 font encoding, activated with \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}.

Then just type them, if you are using a character coding that includes
them. latin1 does, and I guess several others.

There is also \guillemotleft and \guillemotright

stephen,

this morning you answered phil ratcliffe
regarding the re-use of align;

    But align within minipage still does not work for me - I get too many } or & error in that case.
    
    Since yesterday I have found that I can get it to work with a series of equations with $$ within tabular
    \begin{tabular}{c}
    $eqn1$ \\
    $eqn2$
    \end{tabular}
    or even with an array environment within an equation environment within minipage with \tabularnewline, within tabular.
    
    Is there perhaps an equivalent replacement for & as there is for \\ with \tabularnewline that you (or the list) know of?
    
this really isn't the proper approach.
perhaps you missed the message i sent
in response to your initial query:
    
  the align environment works only at "outer" level
  (which can be directly within a minipage); it
  cannot be used within any other environment,
  particularly within another display environment.
  instead, use the aligned environment:

    ===================================
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{amsmath}
    \begin{document}
      \begin{tabular}{cc}
       \begin{minipage}{2in}
         \flushleft text
       \end{minipage} &
         $\begin{aligned}
           x & = y+1  \\
           z & = 2 x
       \end{aligned}$
     \end{tabular}
     
    \end{document}
    ==================================

  see the section on "alignment building blocks" in
  the amsmath user's guide (amsldoc.pdf), p.7.
  
  any of these subsidiary environments must be
  in math mode.
    
since i'm at least partly in charge of the
official documentation for amsmath, i'm
quite sure this is the proper approach.

Thanks for your help.

But I'm a plain TeX users.  Does anybody know how to do that with plain TeX?

Thanks again

    Thanks very much for your response! (again). I did indeed miss your post earlier... I would not have deliberately ignored such useful advice as this totally solved my problem!

glad to hear it.

    So regarding your statement:
    the align environment works only at "outer" level
    (which can be directly within a minipage)

    So align can be used within minipage but not if the minipage is within tabular? I had thought minipage provided its own [outer-level-like] environment...

align *can* be used within minipage,
regardless of where the minipage appears.
you are correct that minipage provides
an "outer-level-like" environment.

    In the AMS doc though I never would have guessed aligned could be the solution (so thanks for being so kind as to even pointing out the exact page number) - its main usage is suggested to be for controlling the spacing around the contents, in my interpretation of that section, unless I am missing something. Is it a width limitation which causes align to be picky about which environment it's in?

the multi-line environments are of two kinds:
 - outer-level only, with the mechanism to
   apply display labels in appropriate locations;
 - subsidiary environments, meant to be nested
   as self-contained elements within other
   environments; these mostly end with "ed",
   but split can also be considered part of
   this group.
measurement *is* involved in processing both
kinds of environments, but it's the label
attachment mechanism that complicates the
outer-level environments and forces them to
be set to the full text width.

the documentation is scheduled to undergo
an update later this year.  it looks like
some clarification is in order for that
section; it's already on our list.  if you
have any specific, concrete suggestions,
please send them (off list) to
tech-support at ams.org.

You have saved the file as utf-8. This will not work, in utf-8 ? is
encoded with more than 8 bits and so is not a char for pdftex. 

But you can use the ligatures << and >>:

\font\test=texnansi-lmr10\test

<< abc >>

Just a suggestion (and not necessary), but
why not give the glyphs their correct name ?

They are guillemets (glyphs), not guillemots (birds) !

    Even if I try to put \protect in front of & and \\, it still has problems, and putting 
    \protect{\begin{align*}...\end{align*}}
    will put the statement on the next line rather than in the second column of the table, as I desire.

    Does anyone know how to get around this behavior? Thanks very much in advance,

the align environment works only at "outer" level
(which can be directly within a minipage); it
cannot be used within any other environment,
particularly within another display environment.
instead, use the aligned environment:

    ===================================
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{amsmath}
    \begin{document}
      \begin{tabular}{cc}
       \begin{minipage}{2in}
         \flushleft text
       \end{minipage} &
         $\begin{aligned}
           x & = y+1  \\
           z & = 2 x
       \end{aligned}$
     \end{tabular}
    
    \end{document}
    ==================================

see the section on "alignment building blocks" in
the amsmath user's guide (amsldoc.pdf), p.7.
  
any of these subsidiary environments must be
in math mode.

First I got the following:

 ! Font \test=texnansi-lmr10 not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not found.

, then I fetched somewhere the file texnansi-lmr10.tfm and put it in the
present directoy, and now this seems to work:


\pdfmapfile{+lm-texnansi.map}

\font\test=texnansi-lmr10\test

<<abc>> 

\bye 


, but only with pdftex.  No way to have it also with `tex'?

Another question: how do you input ? and ??  I have no such character on my
italian keyboard, I input it with copy and paste.

Thanks
Rodolfo

Sure, tex itself needs only the tfm. But the postprocessor (dvips?)
needs to know the which real font it should use. So you should
install the map for this postprocessor. How depends on your system
(I already have the latin modern fonts installed so I even don't
need the \pdfmapfile command). Modern systems use updmap for the
installation of map-files. 

You can also use e.g. the ec fonts:

\font\test=ecrm1000\test

<< abc >>
\bye
\endinput

On windows I can input it by activating the "num" key and then 
ALT+0171  on the numeric keyboard. But in general I use a short cut
I have defined in my editor (winedt).

Message-ID: <a10948b50904120335n1090413fj5384a2fb15566b6a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I wonder if any of you knows how to implement (if this is possible) a
TeX or LaTeX macro that passes multiple (optional) arguments as a
single list (with delimiters), i.e. as executable as below

\somecommand[item1, item2, item3,...]{...}

As I see this style a lot for class specification (e.g.
\documentclass[a4paper,draft]{article}), I shouldn't think why this is
not possible for macros. So far however I can't find how to do this in
a documentation, although there are discussions on how to 'increase'
the number of arguments with keyval package etc. What I'd rather is a
listed single argument, whether optional or obligatory, as it is
cleaner and structurable.

Any advice???

Yo

Hello Yo,

If you simply want to parse a comma-separated list then the internal
macro \@for should help.

\documentclass{article}
\makeatletter
\newcommand*{\MyMacro}[2][]{%
  \@for\my at temp:=#1\do{%
    Option seen: \my at temp \\
  }%
  Main argument: #2
}
\makeatother
\begin{document}
\MyMacro[option1,option2,option3]{Content}
\end{document}

You can of course do what you like with the temporary variable (in this
case \my at temp).

Subject: [texhax] Latin Modern Condensed Bold font?
Message-ID: <20090412145529.160DE2C0F7@mail.djalbat.com>

Hi,

 

I finished typesetting my book some time ago and I'm happy with the
interior, but the cover text still bothers me. I'd initially used Latin
Modern Bold and, as I recall, asked for alternatives on this mailing list.
Latin Modern Condensed was suggested and I duly swapped over:

 

\sffamily\fontseries{sbc}

 

I'm not entirely happy with the results, however, I think the text weight is
far too light and the result looks amateurish:

 

http://www.aleph-one.com/php/coverimage.php?name=cover.jpg

 

>From my (admittedly rather vague) understanding of font selection, 'Latin
Modern Condensed Bold' would be something of a misnomer since both 'Bold'
and 'Condensed' both pertain to the selection's series and therefore cannot
be combined in the way that, say 'Italic' and 'Bold' can.

 

Nonetheless, I've definitely seen bolder condensed fonts around. Can anyone
suggest one? It will only be used for the cover and title pages so it
doesn't really matter if it's not part of the Latin Modern collection
(indeed I'm pretty sure Latin Modern doesn't provide anything suitable).
Obviously something that is in keeping with Latin Modern is required,
however.

 

Many thanks in advance.

 

Kind regards,

 

James

James,

You may be detecting a problem in the underlying design.  You have
centered (title/author) text on a "background" that is left-justified.
 One typographical rule of thumb is to not mix centered design with
left/right-justified elements.

If you do try out a right-justified (which would probably work better
than left-justified) title and author text, you'll also have to fool
around with the positioning, to get it to look good.  For instance,
the author text may need to be indented from the right-hand margin
(but not so much that it's centered).

Also note that if you use all caps, you want to add some tracking, as
it's harder to read all-caps words vs. u/lc.


Regards,

Kathy

Hi Joseph,

Thanks for your response, which is very useful. But as it happens it's
not quite what I wanted. I'd rather apply different actions on the
items in a list, or pass them to different commands or different
arguments of a command.

For example, I'd like to execute

\myMacro[item1,item2,item3]

which calls different commands

\newcommand{\myMacros}[1][]{%
  parse the list argument and
  \command1{item1}
  \command2{item2}
  \command3{item3}
}

or passes them to a single command

\newcommand{\myMacros}[1][]{%
  parse the list argument, assign item1-3 to \first, \second, \third and
  \somecommand{\first}{\second}{\third}
}

Is this a possibility?

Yo
  \macro3{item3}
}




}

Use a display font for the cover, not a book font.  There are thousands
of display fonts to choose from, and it doesn't have to match the 
font of the interior (though both xhold be chosen to be appropriate
for the subject matter).

No, it turns out that parallel.sty and ednotes.sty did not work on the same 
pages, so I cannot contribute. ledpar is well-tested. While the rest of 
ledmac is just a "port" from EDMAC the method of which was Peter Wilson's 
idea, ledpar is Peter Wilson's own work. By contrast to parallel.sty and 
ednotes.sty, here a package writer has studied the matter and worked it out.

Just making clear that this works along Joseph's lines:

     \newcommand{\MyMacro}[2][]{%
         \@for\my at temp:=#1\do{%
             \@usename{MyMacroOption:\my at temp}%
         #2}

... with some

     \newcommand{\DeclareMyMacroOption}[2]{%
         \@namedef{MyMacroOption:#1}{#2}}

     \DeclareMyMacroOption{item-1}{<item-1-stuff>}
     ...

So \DeclareMyMacroOption is just like \newcommand -- without guarding, 
without macro parameters, without backslash, similar to the commands that 
\label and \ref generate.

HTH -- Uwe.

Kathy, hey,

I think you're right. I'd stumbled across this rule of thumb when realising
that a left justified title looked much better than a centered one on the
book's blog, in fact. 

I certainly agree that the problems with the cover are not just down to the
font, either, but are down to the overall design. I'll have another stab at
it and even try right justified title text...

Thanks for the help.

Kind regards,

James

Use a display font for the cover, not a book font.  There are thousands
of display fonts to choose from, and it doesn't have to match the 
font of the interior (though both xhold be chosen to be appropriate
for the subject matter).

I'm just a TUG member, and I don't know if there is a French version  
of proTeXt or TeX Live, if by that you mean a French graphic user  
interface of the installer; if you mean support for writing LaTeX  
documents in French, every TeX distribution has it.

And you don't need the DVD to get proTeXt or TeX Live (moreover, you  
don't need *both*, as both are TeX distributions); you can get either  
one from the Internet.

TeX Live:

http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html

(see the section TeX Live installation over the Internet);

proTeXt:

http://www.tug.org/protext/

For a LaTeX front-end, many people use TeXnicCenter:

http://www.texniccenter.org/

But maybe you'll like TeXmaker (with by default has English, French,  
German and Chinese user interfaces):

http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/

Best,

Axel

Be a little more specific and maybe someone can help.  What exactly are your

Sorry to trouble you.
I am a meny years TeX and LaTeX user and since a few months I have to 
convert pdf files built with PDFLaTeX into MWord files.
Most converters do a pretty good job. But!
Accented letter disappear in the Word file or in the best case they came 
out as `a, `e, etc.
If I use the accented glyphs (?????), they just disappear.
Is there something I can do?

Thanks in advance.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I can reproduce this when I have two lstlisting blocks that define a 
custom basicstyle. So my workaround is to simply change one of them to:

\begin{lstlisting}{basicstyle=\footnotesize}
to:
\begin{lstlisting}

Here is a minimum example for me to reproduce this problem:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%&LaTeX

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{
	columns=fixed
}

\begin{document}

\begin{lstlisting}{basicstyle=\footnotesize}
  A   B   C
  9   8   7
             6  5  4
             D  E  F
\end{lstlisting}

TEXT HERE

\begin{lstlisting}{basicstyle=\footnotesize}
    this is          a  test
    ofth ee          m  ergency
\end{lstlisting}

\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


I assume I am using this wrong, but I have found examples like that and 
also I thought that is what I read in the Listings package documentation.

The above generates (copy and paste from xpdf):

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A     B   C
9     8   7
            6   5   4
            D  E    F
  5
  TEXT HERE
  Command invalid in math modeCommand invalid in math mode
    this is           a   test
    ofth ee           m   ergency
  3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I do not know where the "5" and "3" come from or the repeated error 
message. Also notice how at the "5" and later it is indented.

Any suggestions?

I don't want to set the smaller font size for all listings.

Maybe listings package is not what I need. I want simply to have verbatim 
text to be in the same font as the rest of my document while keeping a 
fixed spacing (for formatting).

Also I could accept using the default font size in the listings (no 
\footnotesize) if the fixed text in there didn't wrap.


Thank you,

Now I found my problem, that should be brackets not braces for the 
options:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\footnotesize]

Use T1-encoding (\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}). Sometimes you also need
the package cmap. 

And if you use accented glyphs (?????) in the input: don't forget to
use inputenc.

My maketitle is composed by

\date{...........}
\abstract{............}
\resume{............}

and I have a footnote inside the author macro which correspond to the

from "cuted" package to cut automaticaly one of the box (abstract or 
resume) which overflow on the bottom of page.
In this case the footnote is put on the bottom of the second page 
whereas it must be on the first

Anyone have an idea ?

whereas it must be on the first

Anyone have an idea ?

Subject: [texhax] Failed to convert input string to UTF16
Message-ID: <D43515E1-175D-4025-BC8C-3E0820E72BB4@mac.com>

Hello everyone! Im using Lyx 1.6.2 with the latest version of Texlive.  
Im trying to get Linux libertine font in my system to work but althoug  
I get results, there are some characters in the titles that are in  
chinese! but in fact, they are spanish accentuated chars. Why are the  
chinese chars appearing?

This is my current preamble. Mind that all the fonts are installed and  
they work.... I surmise the problem is related with the encoding? But  
I set the encoding to UTF-8 (Xetex)

% !TEX TS?program = xetex
% !TEX encoding = UTF?8 Unicode

It isn't really what you are asking for (I'm not sure what you are really 
asking for) but there is

\usepackage[draft]{graphicx}

(or "graphics" or whichever package declaration you use for
graphic inclusing... ass "draft" to the options)

That will omit all the images, placing a box in their place.



Other possibilities are to produce ps or pdf files and 
view them.


Maybe your particular dvi viewer has a setting to cache 
the images, but you will have to check its documentation,

Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, 
potential impact for building DML, and clarity. Final paper versions should
conform to the Springer LNCS (llncs class) style, preferably using LaTeX2e.

Submission categories:
Full paper: 4-12 LNCS pages
Short paper/poster/work in progress report: 1-4 LNCS pages 

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects, 
asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow [CEDRAM/Euclid model])?

Proceedings:
will be published by Masaryk University and will be available on site,
with best papers chosen for postconference proceedings published
by renowned publisher or for journal.

Keynote (conditioned by funding approval):

Paul,

On first glance it looks like a fairly standard article class, maybe  
memoir? On the other hand it may be a highly customised journal class  
specific to their publication, in which case they probably have the  
class file available for authors. Of course I have no idea what  
packages they might have used. Have you considered asking the editors  
or the publisher?

Cheers
Alan

Thanks you for your response.

What I would like exactely is a technical way to detect theme before the 
use in LaTeX and to correct theme by Photoshop.

Anyone have an idea ?

Seems to me that perhaps what you want is a script.  On the Mac or
Linux one could write a csh (or tcsh or bash or sh or probably better
yet perl) script to detect the size of your files.  (On windows one
can do things like this under cygwin.)  Rather than calling photoshop,
the script would call a program that would automatically manipulate
the images (always keeping a backup and working with a copy
probably!).  Imagemagick (just google that) is a set of programs that
is great for that and within imagemagick is the powerful 'convert'
program that could be used to adjust the image.

At this point I write scripts to do almost everything and only rarely
use a program like photoshop.  The reason is that it allows me to
repeat the manipulations and to have a precise record of what I did.

Message-ID: <BAY134-W32186F6699D5BDFDFC371A47A0@phx.gbl>


Hi,

I have some problems with my Latex document and I can't find any group discussion that could help me. I'm kind of desperate :) and I'm sorry to contact you. But you may be able to give me the link for a good forum or something like that ? Thanks a lot.

Best regards,

Lore.

PS : Here is my problem =>
I'd like to realise an automatic repport with
the combination of R and Latex (Sweave package). I create several plots with R, and then
I'd like to include them in my Latex document. The thing is that I
don't know how many plots I'll get before I run my program, so I can't
write \includegraphics for every plots. Therefore my code is :


 	  
			  \multido{\i=1+1}{\Sexpr{numPage}}{\includegraphics[page=\i]{image.pdf}}	




Each plot is on 1 page of my pdf file "image.pdf" and I include all
the pages (here, there are "numPage" pages). The problem is that all
the plots are on the same line and I get a "Overful box" because there
are too many plots. Could you help me ?



I also tried to use \includepdf[page=-]{image.pdf}

but each page of the pdf file is on one page of my latex document.
And I'd like to avoid empty space, thus I'd like several plots centered
on the same line, just like \includegraphics does.

Give LaTeX a chance to find a place to break the line. Add e.g. a
space after the graphic. 

If you want a paragraph break after each graphics you should
probably better use whiledo from the ifthen package

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{ifthen}
\newcounter{myloop}
\setcounter{myloop}{1}    
\begin{document}
\whiledo{\value{myloop}<50}
 {\themyloop: \rule{4cm}{3cm}\par
 \stepcounter{myloop}}
\end{document}

Without knowing the internals, and without having tested anything, I would
give this a try:

\newcommand{\saveOriginalFootnoteDefinition}
\let\saveOriginalFootnoteDefinition\footnote
\usepackage[...]{hyperref}
\let\footnote\saveOriginalFootnoteDefinition

It is an attempt to restore the definition of \footnote after loading the
hyperref package.

Perhaps this helps,

Message-ID: <1240052718.49e9b3ee0508c@webmail.mun.ca>

I need to write a macro, say \sit (for small italic size)
so that \sit{xxxx} should put the "xxxx" in a smaller italic
shape "relative to" the body text font size (and not an absolute small italics
size). If I write the macro as follows

\newcommand{\sit}[1]{{\footnotesize\itshape #1}}

it works fine if the body font is \normalsize, but if the body 
text size is reduced to \small, \tiny, or \footnotesize, 
the \sit{xxxx} command does not produce a proportionately smaller 
italic font, but keeps its original size as it was using before, 
when working with normalsize body text.

How can I change the above macro so that \sin{xxxx}  puts 
a "smaller italic" shape "relative to the body font used, and not an
"absolute small italics"?

There is a LaTeX 2.09 package `smaller' on CTAN, dating from 1990. It has a \smaller and a \larger command. Does it help?

Please have a look at the "relsize" package. The documentation is in the 
style file itself, at the beginning and the end.

Thanks very muchg for the tips.  Both "relsize", and CV Radhakrishnan's
macro work fine and does the job  (The old LaTeX 209 package 
"smaller" is now superceded by "relsize" package)

Hi Toby,

so you have based cleveref.sty on sed? Traitor !-)

There have been already datatool, stringstrings, ted, xstring for string 
substitution using TeX. Scott Pakin's perltex moreover provides 
("exported") text processing macros that work independently of the Perl 
installation which they were created with (right?).

I have now provided basic setup of *expandable* chains of string 
substitutions processing (TeX) files with essentially catcodes 11 and 12 
only, so you can, e.g.,

     \immediate\write\result_file{\Transform{\InputLine}}

in /macros/latex/contrib/nicetext. So far, I have just used it for 
replacing `...' by $\dots$, `etc. ' by `etc.\ ' etc.

By the way, in (My Code Blog)

     http://sdh33b.blogspot.com/2008/07/icfp-contest-2008.html

Steve Hicks reports about controlling a mars rover using TeX. (The 
discussion then considers Metafont as well.)

TeX forever!

     Uwe.

Thanks to some very helpful comments from Barbara Beeton (off-list) and
to the on-list replies, I've now more or less got this working.

Since catcodes are fixed when the characters are first read (apart from
special commands like \string and \meaning), it seems there's no way to
do what I want directly. So instead, I first write the unescaped text to
a temporary file, then modify the appropriate catcodes and re-read this
temporary file, writing it out again to the final destination file. The
modified catcodes are in effect when the file is re-read, so the
characters get expanded to their escaped form when they're re-written.

The only thing holding me back from dispensing with the temporary file
is that I can't figure out how to write a newline character to an
external file. None of the following seem to work:

\write\@stream{^^M}
\write\@stream{\\}
{\lccode`|=13 \lowercase{\write\@stream{|}}}

Is there some way to write out an explicit newline? Please don't just
tell me I could do it by writing the file one line at a time. That's
what I'm doing at the moment, but it requires the temporary file. I have
to loop through the temporary file, reading a line from it and
immediately re-writing it (with escapes expanded) to the final file. I
could store the text to be written in a macro that gets added to each
iteration, and write it all out to file at the very end. But then I need
to insert the newlines manually into the macro so that they appear in
the file when it's written out, hence my question.


In answer to Donald Arseneau's comments: I realise TeX's file
input/output features aren't designed for dealing with anything other
than files containing TeX source. But the file I'm writing *is* mostly
TeX code. The sed script contains rules for replacing one sequence of
LaTeX commands with another. The LaTeX commands to be replaced aren't
known until the LaTeX source file is processed, so I *have* to write out
at least some of the information from within TeX. Given that I have to
write something from TeX, I might as well write the entire sed script
from TeX if I can.

Finally, in reply to Michael Doob: I now think that writing a Perl
script instead of sed would only make things slightly simpler. I would
still need to escape the "\" character inside Perl strings when writing
the script file from TeX, and we're back to my original problem :) By
the way, awk can also be made to escape special characters in a string
prior to using it as a computed regexp, though not in quite so simple a
way as Perl. But I seem to have it working with sed now, anyway.

Thanks for everyone's help, and I hope someone can shed similar light on
my final dilemma.

Toby

Hi Uwe,

Yes, I made cleveref write out a sed script. As for the sed/awk/perl
debate, I personally prefer to use the simplest tool for the job: sed if
possible, awk if sed isn't up to it, and perl if the awk solution would be
too complicated. (I've never yet gotten as far as perl :)

I completely see why one might like to make cleveref write out a TeX
script instead (the script would then need to use one of the string
substitution packages you mention). The reasoning, of course, is that if
someone is using cleveref, then they're guaranteed to have TeX installed
and working, so by far the most portable and robust solution is to
generate a TeX script to carry out the desired string substitutions.

However, implementing this would be far more work than I'm prepared to put
into a feature that is simply a work-around that allows me (and maybe
others) to submit papers to journals that accept LaTeX but don't support
cleveref (i.e. all of them :-)

If someone wanted to contribute a patch that (optionally) generated a TeX
(or awk or perl) script, instead of a sed script, I'd be happy to include
it in cleveref...

Toby

PS: I read about the Mars rover project a while back. It definitely falls
into the "foolish quest" category :)

Subject: [texhax] Accessing unusual Latin Modern glyphs in plain TeX
Message-ID: <49EE123D.6050703@gmail.com>

Is there are relatively simple way to access some of the more unusual
glyphs that are present in the Latin Modern fonts, but which don't seem to
appear in the standard encodings?

For example (just to pick one more or less at random) LM includes glyphs
for Abrevehookabove, U+1EB2, which I believe does not occur in any of the
standard encodings. How would I go about getting that character to print
using plain TeX (actually, pdfTeX)?

Or is it so painful that I really don't want to know?

Hi Doc,
U+1EB2 is not unusual.  About 85 million people are using it several
times per day.  :) 

If you want to typeset Vietnamese, use T5 encoding.

OK, so my example was bad. Still, I thought I was clear that it was only an
example.

Instead of trying to come up with a character that isn't in any of the
common encodings and risk someone else pointing out that the character I
happen to choose is in one of the standard encodings, pretend that I asked
the question, but using some generic character fleb, where fleb is a
unicode character available in LM, but not available in the standard encodings.

I looked through the common encodings and didn't immediately see
"cdotaccent" (U+010B) in any of them, so I think you can regard the
invented character "fleb" as being equivalent to "cdotaccent".

I hope I haven't made myself hopelessly unclear.

Subject: [texhax] One author several years in citation.
Message-ID: <9E55BE98-E0E8-4823-9FAC-0F4C85543A00@auckland.ac.nz>


Suppose I wish to cite a number of papers by Fred Nurk,
dated 2001, 2004, and 2006.  I'd like the appearance of the
citation in the text to look like:

	... see for instance Nurk (2001, 2004, 2006) for details
	on this fascinating issue.

Rather than:


	... see for instance Nurk (2001), Nurk (2004), Nurk (2006) for details
	on this fascinating issue.

Is there any way to effect this?  Any bibliography style file that  
will effect
this?  I couldn't find any reference to this issue in a moderately  
extensive
search.

Thanks for any help.

	cheers,

		Rolf Turner

Subject: [texhax] Accessing unusual Latin Modern glyphs in plain TeX
In-Reply-To: <49EE123D.6050703@gmail.com>
Message-ID: <200904212237.n3LMbTd16721@f7.net>

    Is there are relatively simple way to access some of the more
    unusual glyphs that are present in the Latin Modern fonts, but which
    don't seem to appear in the standard encodings?

Yes.

(1) Find the TFM file with the glyph (the painful part, see below).
Let's call it foo.tfm.

(2) Run tex testfont, give it foo for the font name, type \table\end to
the * prompt.  Inspect the output to find the octal or hex location of
the glyph.  Let's call that number NN in hex.

(3) Say
\font\myfont = foo
\myfont \char"NN
Done.


Going back to finding the TFM file, if you want to do it visually, 
  cd /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/lm  # or wherever
  ls *-lmr10.tfm
will show you all the lmr10.tfm's and you can run testfont on all of
them to see the complete repertoire.

Another way is to search for character names:
  cd /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/lm/
  grep -i hook *

If your search is clever enough, this will show you which of the
encoding files lm-ENC.enc it's in, which you can then map back to the
ENC-lmr10.tfm. 

I think a third way would be to open up
/usr/local/texmf/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm/lmroman10-regular.otf
in (say) fontforge and look at it.  (It has essentially all the
available glyphs, I believe.)  Somewhere in there fontforge should be
able to tell you the glyph names, which you can then map back to a TFM
as above.

XeTeX and LuaTeX, which can read otf directly, also come to mind, but I
don't have a recipe.


Hope this helps,
Karl

Hi Uwe,

Firstly, I should make it clear that in normal usage cleveref doesn't need
any string substitutions at all. It's only the "poorman" option that needs
them, and even then it doesn't require any string substitutions to
actually process the LaTeX file and generate the dvi or pdf.

When the "poorman" option is supplied, in addition to the usual processing
of the LaTeX document, cleveref will write a sed script for you,
containing substitutions that replace all of the cleveref cross-reference
commands in the document with something that's (very nearly) equivalent,
but that uses just the standard LaTeX \ref command.

For example, using cleveref, \cref{eq1,eq2,eq3} would be type-set as
"equations~(1) to~(3)". With the "poorman" option, the following
substitution would be written to the sed script:

  s/\\cref{eq1,eq2,eq3}/equations~(\\ref{eq1}) to~(\\ref{eq3})/g

which replaces all occurences of "\cref{eq1,eq2,eq3}" with
"equations~(\\ref{eq1}) to~(\\ref{eq3})".

Once you've processed the document the requisite number of times to get
the cross-references right, you can then run the original source file
through the sed script to produce a new LaTeX source file, from which all
the cleveref commands have been stripped out and replaced by equivalent
standard LaTeX, suitable for submitting to a journal (or sending to a
colleague) who doesn't have cleveref installed.

Hope that makes it clear,

Toby

The last thing is quite important, I think, so "poorman" is almost inevitable.

I understand all of this to the effect that cleveref does the clever thing,
not sed, so cleveref determines an expansion <plain> of a \cref term <clever>.
When cleveref finds *one* <clever> in "poorman" mode, it tells an external
program to replace *all* occurrences of <clever> by <plain>.

To replace sed by TeX, I propose writing to <out>=\jobname.ffd as follows:

     {\let\ref\relax \let\cref\relax
      \immediate\write<out>{\string\AddReplacement{<clever>}{<plain>}}}

(Is cleveref clever enough not to do this twice for *one* <clever>?)

A fifinddo script \inputs \jobname.ffd to set up a sequence of substitution 
macros acting on each line of \jobname.tex.

\AddReplacement would be defined by the next version of fifinddo.
Currently there is only setup for replacement macros with explicit 
identifiers,
\AddReplacement would use this with automatically generated identifiers.

fifinddo is in my view better suited for reworking TeX files than those 
other mere string handling packages. datatool may be well too, but the 
documentation is so large and I don't see that it deals with backslashes 
(it seems to deal with "data", not TeX code). (And it currently suffers 
from a substr.sty bug.)

Hope this will happen -- Uwe.

[OK Tom? You are right. Oh, Philip, you are right as well!]

Not necessarily. As with any LaTeX package, you can easily just send
cleveref.sty along with the document. If it's saved in the same directory
as the LaTeX document, TeX will process the document just fine. I've
submitted articles to the arXiv preprint server (which automatically
produces postscript and PDF versions) in this way.

The problem is mainly with publishers who don't actually use TeX to
produce the final type-set version from the LaTeX source, but instead
transform the LaTeX into their own in-house mark-up language before
sending to press. Such publishers place restrictions on which (if any)
LaTeX packages can be used, since they likely won't work unless supported
explicitly by their transformation scripts.

Exactly.

[Well, not quite exactly :) Cleveref doesn't need to expand \cref etc. in
terms of \ref when the document is simply being processed by TeX (it
by-passes \ref altogether), but it does generate an expansion in this way
for the purposes of writing the sed script when the "poorman" option is
supplied. But this isn't particularly relevant to this discussion.]

Nope. It's not that clever :) It just writes out one substitution rule for
each cross-reference, whether or not that happens to be identical to a
previous one. At least for sed, it doesn't matter, because applying the
first matching rule will always produce the correct results.

In the latest cleveref version (not yet on CTAN), I also use sed addresses
to cope with babel language changes. I don't know how easy that would be
to replicate with fifinddo.

Could be. But cleveref only needs very simple substitutions, so sed is
more than sufficient. The only advantage I see in using fifinddo is that
some (especially Windows) users might not have sed installed, whereas if
they're using cleveref they must have TeX installed. On the other hand,
they'll have to install fifinddo (or whatever other TeX string
substitution package), and it's not completely clear that's any easier...

If someone sends me a working patch against cleveref.dtx, I'd be happy to
consider including it. I'm unlikely to implement it myself.

As "equation~" etc. in <plain> will be typical, there should be \let~\relax

Subject: [texhax] TeX-compatible font containing yogh?
Message-ID: <49EF4EE9.3080308@gmail.com>

I'm typesetting something in Latin Modern, but just this morning discovered
that the LM family contains no yogh (nor even an ezh, which would do at a
pinch -- odd that it's missing both, because otherwise it seems remarkably
complete).

Can anyone here recommend a family that might reasonably be expected to be
available in plain TeX-compatible format, which would be reasonably
compatible with surrounding Latin Modern text, and which contains a yogh
(or, if not, an ezh)?

I'm running Kubuntu 8.10 and the basic TeX system is TeXLive; I have
installed essentially all the optional Kubuntu TeX-compatible fonts. So I'm
hoping that someone might be able to tell me that one of them has a yogh.

  Doc

PS Obviously, if I have to I can build a yogh in metafont -- I recall doing
that many years ago, but I'm hoping that I don't need to do it again all
these years later with a modern system.

PPS Sorry if this is a bit OT. I couldn't think of where else to post this
question. If you have a suggestion for a better place, please tell me.

It seems if cleveref is clever enough to write to files under babel, then 
fifinddo needn't care about babel anymore. Users are urged to do the file 
processing *before* any typesetting packages are loaded. It expects 
(currently) that the tilde is the only active character indeed. (Otherwise 
one could turn almost all characters ``other'' at reading.)

The difference between cleveref and fifinddo concerning installing is that 
fifinddo really isn't needed for typesetting. It is an alternative to sed, 
not to cleveref, and installing a LaTeX package should be easier than 
installing an executable/application.

Concerning string handling, fifinddo is ridiculous (at present, but there 
may be little need to change it), it is only a nucleus of string handling. 
But the other string handlers don't care about where strings come from and 
where they go. fifinddo acts on files and provides a script language for 
this (or setup for creating script languages).

OK, it is clear what to do, and the rest may happen off the list.

I wouldn't say "patch". cleveref should just have an additional option 
"poorman-tex" that writes (La)TeX-like output instead of sed output -- 
hoping there will be some TeX package that can make use of it. And an 
expansion of fifinddo should be such a TeX package. Or other string 
handlers are expanded to act on files. Or datatool learns to consider TeX 
code "data".

But this won't happen today.

cleveref might have an alias "poorman-sed" for "poorman", and additional 
options "poorman-awk" and "poorman-perl".

TeX forever!

     Uwe.

I found cmoe at http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcb/fonts/. The yogh there is
good enough (albeit distinctly different from the yogh used by the OUP,
which I prefer).

If anyone happens to know an answer to the original question without doing
any work, I'd still be interested in knowing of more modern fonts that
contain a yogh glyph. But don't bother going to any effort, since my
problem is sufficiently well solved now.

Just to clarify, the babel issue is that there might have to be one
substitution for, say, "\cref{eq1}" at one location in the source file,
and a *different* substitution for exactly the same string "\cref{eq1}" at
a different location in the file, because the language has changed.

Just consider the following fragment:

...
\selectlanguage{english}
\cref{eq1}
\selectlanguage{german}
\cref{eq1}
...

Sed can easily accommodate this using line-number rule addresses. Never
having used them, I have no idea how easy it would be to do using fifinddo
or other (La)TeX string substitution packages.

Implementing this would require copying and modifying the poorman code in
cleveref.dtx to create the new option, and that code involves messing
around with cleveref internals. I would prefer (insist?) that any such
changes are sent to me as a patch against the latest cleveref.dtx
available from my web site (www.dr-qubit.org/latex.php). That way I can
easily merge it with any local changes I might have made to cleveref but
not yet released.

(I suggest taking any further discussion off-list, as it's probably
becoming uninteresting to most list subscribers.)

All the best,

Toby

... the Python script de-macro (ctan.tug.org/pkg/de-macro) especially and

fifinddo provides the same functionality, see section 5.2, pp. 15f. of

     http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/nicetext/fifinddo.pdf

This is used in makedoc.sty to activate the code/comment distinction only 
after a certain number of lines, so the legal informations in the file 
header is typeset verbatim.

This needs, of course, that cleveref outputs (also for "poorman-tex", as it 
seems to do for sed) a report of \selectlanguage.

I have also used it for debugging, setting \tracingmacros=1 at a certain 
line and =0 at the next one or so. This is another point on: Using TeX for 
filtering is only partially string substitution. I don't say that awk etc. 
can be replaced by a TeX algorithm for string substitution. Rather: TeX 
offers so much to replace other software. And for this is it doesn't 
suffice to choose among string handling packages. You need *file* handling 
as well. file-find-do!

TeX Forever!

"texdoc comprehensive" does absolutely nothing here (well, other than
return me to the shell prompt).

I meant "as opposed to a font intended for some completely different
purpose"; i.e., basically something without .tfm files. Sorry for the
ambiguity.

I know that for a font wizard like you, almost anything is plain-TeX
compatible. For mere mortals (in my case, very mortal) who have never
mastered the intricacies of fontinst, virtual fonts, etc., basically we
need a package that simply installs and works :-)

Hi,

I had trouble with my computer and had to re-install Window; consequently, I now have to re-install all my programs, including MikTeX.

So, I went to the MiKTeX download page and selected the
MikTeX 2.7 Net Installer. I was successfull in downloading the program. I then proceeded to install the program, however, this did not work.

I have all the various packages of The MiKTeX program in my Program Files under MikTeX 2.7 but when I select Star, All Programs, I do  not find Teknic Center among my programs. However, I have MiKTeX 2.7 with the following menu: Help, MiKTeX on the Web, Browse packages and Setting & Update.

I am at a lost as to what to do next. Can anyone help with this problem.

Thanks

Texniccenter is not a part of miktex. You have to install it on its
own get it from http://www.texniccenter.org. 

(They are alternatives like winedt, emacs, texmaker, ... ).

Texnic Center is a different program from Miktex. You can get it from

So it does!  I just wasn't going at it right.  Looking for complete
automation, which isn't quite there.  Figured out what to do when I
was pointed at apacite --- but then didn't make the connection that I
could've done the  same thing with natbib.  Duhhhhhh!

presumably, last time you installed, you installed protext, which is 
miktex plus tools (including texniccenter). MiKTeX is just LaTeX and 
friends, no editors.

*LaTeX and Wiki editing/typesetting job opportunity - ASAP*

The CK-12 foundation (www.ck12.org), a non-profit dedicated to creating free
and open textbooks, is looking for wiki editors to edit math content
(algebra, trigonometry, calculus, geometry, etc) using latex syntax on our
wiki. The job entails working from two hard copy manuscripts: one that is
copy edited with traditional copy editing symbols (which we can train you
quickly on and/or provide reference) and one that is a technical edit with
accuracy changes. Individual must be self-starter, ability to work
independently, meet deadlines, proficient in LaTeX syntax, and detail
oriented. Experience and interest in educational technology a plus.
Proximity to the Bay Area a major plus.
*Please pass this on to your colleagues, students, and friends whom you

There's a way built into most document classes, but it's probably
easiest to just use the package multicol:

\usepackage{multicol}
....
\begin{multicols}{2}%Or however many columns you want
...
\end{multicols}
...

The multicol package is very flexible and the appearance (eg. space
between columns, lines between columns) can be automatically.

Just use { \small text}... For more sizes, see

I imagine that is indeed what Sara is currently stuck with, but
it's pretty kludgy.  It entails hand-formatting each citation.

Some clever person, who knows how to build bibliography style
files has a moral obligation [ :-) ] to put one together that
would automate the process.  Fortunately for me, I'm not nearly
that clever.

jurabib has a footcite command, and biblatex naturally too:

\begin{filecontents}{test2.bib}
@BOOK{test,
	AUTHOR="W. Tester",
	TITLE="A test on footcite",
	PUBLISHER="Tester Publications",
	YEAR="2009" }
\end{filecontents}

\documentclass[paper=a4]{scrartcl}
\usepackage[citestyle=verbose]{biblatex}
\bibliography{test2}
\begin{document}
a test\footcite{test}
test\footcite{test}
 \end{document}

I'm using glossaries.sty to create a glossary. My glossary is two pages long. Each page has a different page style (first page style is set to empty), and page layout dimensions (\topmargin, etc.) I need to format both pages to look the same, but cannot find any information in glossaries.sty, the manual, or the web, to do this.

I suspect this is a common problem with packages. Is there some common way to override package layout settings and default to existing settings?

Greetings All!

As many of you probably know, Unix-like operating systems allow output
to their terminals to change color (amongst other things) by escape
sequences beginning with the character . While there is some
variation between Unixes on how this is done, color is reasonably
consistent on most Unix-like OSes. For example, [33m would turn the
text orange while [39;49m would make it normal again.

It occurs to me that a LaTeX package that gives colorful output would
be nice. However, I can't figure out how to get LaTeX to print . I've
played around a little using \typeout and \message with \noexpand and
\special, to no success.

I was hoping other may have an idea... I'm also curious to hear what
others think of this idea.

Sincerely,

Christopher Olah

Subject: [texhax] Integrating Lilypond in LaTeX documents
Message-ID: <68261.38416.qm@web110211.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm new here, and relatively new to LaTeX as well. I am using MikTeX and TeXnic Center.

How does one integrate Lilypond (music notation program) into LaTeX documents? It appears that there is something called 'lilypond-latex', mentioned at http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.3/Documentation/user/out-www/lilypond/Invoking-lilypond_002dlatex.html, and something else (?) at http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.9/Documentation/user/lilypond/Integrating-Texinfo-and-music#Integrating-Texinfo-and-music. It looks very nice, to be able to just have a lilypond environment. Unfortunately these pages totally confuse me... How do I get started? How can I get TeXnic Center to recognize Lilypond?

I'm expecting the process to be something like using Asymptote (vector graphics language) in LaTeX, as described in http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Wiki/index.php/Asymptote:_Advanced_Configuration#Using_Asymptote_in_LaTeX (full instructions so convenient for computer-illiterate like me)... it'd be nice if it's possible to get it to work the same way.

Thanks in advance,
John

Greetings!

I just read through the lilypond-latex documentation you linked to.
It's a little confusing. A better explanation can be found here:
http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.9/Documentation/user/lilypond/Integrating-LaTeX-and-music
And an example with compiling instructions can be found here:
http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.9/Documentation/user/lilypond/An-example-of-a-musicological-document

They're both part of this document
(http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.9/Documentation/user/lilypond/An-example-of-a-musicological-document)
on integrating lilypond and typesetting software.

It's rather different than asymptote... And I have no clue about
``TeXnic Center''...

Best wishes!

Christopher

PS. I really don't understand why I keep not hitting the reply to all.
I even thought of it while I was reading the documentation. Sorry to

You can try processing this (test.tex, all characters are ASCII)

    \message{This text in ^^1b[31mred^^1b[0m.}
    \bye

with the command

    tex -translate-file=./esc.tcx test.tex

placing the attached file (esc.tcx) in the same directory with
test.tex.

> I'm also curious to hear what others think of this idea.

I think that nowadays people mostly use text editors to run TeX, and
those editors probably never process the color escapes in the output.
So most users will just see junk in their output.  But as a local hack
for a specific use this seems like a cool idea :).

Best,
Oleg

Actually, you can trim that file to just the first line:

    0x1b   0x1b

The rest makes 8-bit characters "printable", but you don't need that
if you only use ASCII in your sources.

The tex-mode I use in emacs already gives me some really useful color on 
input, and since its default run mode is to split the screen and dump 
out the simplified log file in a separate window, I wonder if that 
output coule be searched for patterns that would produce colors.  I can 
see some real time-saving possibilities in that, particularly in the 
cascading error information that quite often hides some really useful 
debugging hints.  I am pretty well convinced that emacs lisp can do 
anything.

Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, 
potential impact for building DML, and clarity. Final paper versions should
conform to the Springer LNCS (llncs class) style, preferably using LaTeX2e.

Submission categories:
Full paper: 4-12 LNCS pages
Short paper/poster/work in progress report: 1-4 LNCS pages 

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects, 
asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow [CEDRAM/Euclid model])?

Proceedings:
will be published by Masaryk University and will be available on site,
with best papers chosen for postconference proceedings published
by renowned publisher or for journal.

Keynote (conditioned by funding approval):
David Ruddy (Project Euclid, Cornell University Library, US): Getting
from Here to There: Assembling the Pieces of the Digital Mathematics Library

Topics: 
(include, but are not limited to)
  o search, indexing and retrieval of mathematical documents
  o ranking of mathematical papers, similarity of mathematical documents

  o conversions between various mathematical formalisms
  o mathematical document compression
  o processing of scanned images
  o algorithms for crosslinking of bibliographical items,

There are also packages `trace' (Frank Mittelbach) and `silence' (Paul Isambert) (and ...) for such purposes, but indeed I think of colouring parts of package informations, warnings, and error messages, or in debugging: turn red when we come to the passage where the error occurs. 

Best, 

    Uwe.

It also works with my latex on my Linux with \typeout. Great, thanks!

I need \catcode`\^^1b=12 to avoid "invalid character". 

I have found http://http://kb.iu.edu/data/adzf.html for other colours and effects.

I wonder about "editors" here. The screen output is generated by TeX from the input files, independent on editors. Or are you thinking of editors that suppress ^^1b in writing to the text file?

Cheers, 

    Uwe.

there are several ways, but to override something, you need to know what.
I guess that the differences in page style have nothing to do immediately
with creating a glossary, but with this glossary being treated as another
chapter of your book. I have no experience with glossaries, and no idea
about the document class you are using, so I cannot help you any further.
How about providing a minimal example?

Hi TUG support,


I am trying to implement the pstricks in LaTeX, starting with the Examples 
on page 226 - Example 5.5.5 of the LaTeX Graphics Companion (Actually I 
have tried two other similar examples Example 5.5.6 & 5.5.7 on page 227) 
UNSUCCESSFULLY.

I am using mactex TeXShop. and have not had any other problems with my 
installations etc.

When I compile the examples one of which is coded as follows;

my preamble contains

\RequirePackage{pstricks}
%

\begin{pspicture}(2,2)
        \psgrid
\end{pspicture}\hspace{2em}
\begin{pspicture}(2,2)
        \psgrid[gridwidth=0.1pt]
\end{pspicture}



I get the same error in all of them which is;


! Undefined control sequence.
<recently read> \c at lor@to at ps 
 
l.943 \end
          {pspicture}\hspace{2em}

I'll appreciate your suggestions and assistance


Thank you

Is it possible to do this in a way that is inputenc friendly? I've
been trying to figure out how this all works, and I can understand the
input mapping parts, but I can find no information on how the output
is mapped except a short line in the tex manpage about
-translate-file...

Thanks

Dear Sirs,

How can I create an environment that repeats the contents in question

\begin{repeat}{5}
  A lot of text over several pages.

No, I was talking of editors not treating specially escape sequences
upon _displaying_ of the log file (or the output of TeX).  Emacs, for
example, displays the 0x1b character as ^[ (of course, Emacs can be
easily tweaked to do the right thing).  I can imagine less graceful
behaviors.

I'm not sure what you mean.  I might be mistaken here, but my
understanding is that -translate-file works on a lower level than
inputenc; inputenc comes into play after input characters have been
mapped according to the -translate-file settings.

> I can find no information on how the output is mapped except a short
> line in the tex manpage about -translate-file...

I surmise that characters are mapped back to whatever they've been
mapped from.  However, in this particular case we are not actually
mapping anything, we are just using a side-effect.  When TeX outputs
"unprintable" characters, it prints them in the ^^xx notation, where
xx is a two-digit hex number.  -translate-file changes TeX's notion of
the set of printable characters.  Also, see below an excerpt from
cp227.tcx.

Oleg

%% cp227.tcx
%% $Id: cp227.tcx 1513 2006-02-13 00:22:35Z karl $
%% Originally written 2004, Thomas Esser.
%% This file is released into the public domain.
%% 
%% This TCX file is the default in TeX Live (as of 2004) for all formats
%% except ConTeXt, which doesn't directly display TeX output, and thus
%% can use -8bit.
%% 
%% This file makes all characters with code >= 128 printable for TeX.
%% TeX itself makes all codes in the range of 32 to 127 printable.  The
%% remaining codes (0-31) are problematic, because printing them
%% "verbatim" might upset your terminal. On the other hand, since HT, VT
%% and FF are quite safe, we make these printable.
%% 
%% Even these can cause confusion.  For example,
%% \showhyphens{$\Psi$}
%% will output "[] $\tenrm  $" to the terminal.  That's a real tab
%% character (because \Psi is \mathchardef to "..09), which is
%% definitely confusing.  But it's all a tradeoff.  If we don't make it
%% printable, then when input text is written to the terminal in error
%% messages, a real tab in the input is written as ^^I.
%% 
%% Our consensus was thus to make HT, VT, and FF printable, but not the
%% others.  In future releases, the situation may be improved.
%% 
%% This tcx does not "translate" anything, it just changes
%% printability.  Characters are mapped 1:1.  The total number of
%% printable characters is 227, which gives this file the name.

Subject: [texhax] Link to index in TOC points to first index entry
Message-ID: <200904301453.43800.thomasheinz@gmx.net>

Hi,

Given the following example:

\documentclass{report}
\usepackage{makeidx}
\usepackage[pdftex]{hyperref}
\makeindex
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\cleardoublepage
\index{Test} 1,2,3
\cleardoublepage
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\indexname}
\printindex
\end{document}

I get a pdf document where the link to the index in the table of contents 
points to the correct page but instead of pointing to the top of the page, 
the link points to the first entry in the index. For the bibliography, 
this works correctly.

If I use tocbibind as in the following example, I get the same result.

\documentclass{report}
\usepackage{makeidx}
\usepackage[nottoc]{tocbibind}
\usepackage[pdftex,pdfpagelabels]{hyperref}
\makeindex
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\cleardoublepage
\index{Test} 1,2,3
\cleardoublepage
\phantomsection
\printindex
\end{document}

Is this really expected behaviour?
How can I get a link to the top of the index page?

Thanks for your help.


Best regards,

Thomas

Message-ID: <12601.1241117396@as220.org>


Hi All:

I've never really had to mess with penalties in all the time I've used
TeX, but now I have to, and I don't really get how to go about it.  I
have a long document (~150 pages), and there are only about four places
where the line-breaking isn't working right.  But in those places, I
don't really know what to do.  The FAQ suggests changing some penalties,
but the other 500 paragraphs look fine, and I don't want to make global
changes.  I thought I could do this:

  {\hyphenpenalty5000 Text of offending paragraph.}

But that seems to have no effect, whatever I set the value to.  The FAQ
also suggests appending "\looseness=-1" to the last word of the
paragraph, but that also has no apparent effect.  Can I change these
values locally?  Am I misunderstanding how this is to be done?

To be more specific, there are a couple of paragraphs with offending
last lines (3-letter fragments of hyphenated words), and another couple
with words that stick out into the margins.  I've already fixed all the
places where I could deal with the issue by rewording, so that's not an
option.  I'm using memoir.cls, if that makes a difference somehow.

Any advice welcome, and thanks,

 -tom

Too sophisticated. I usually \hbox{the last two or three words,} 
of the paragraph. I do that throughout the article, to avoid clubs. 

But that seems to have no effect, whatever I set the value to. The FAQ 
also suggests appending "\looseness=-1" to the last word of the 
paragraph 

\looseness is a great tool for page balancing, but it goes at the start of the paragraph 
you are loosening. I always put it after anything else, but before \noindent. 
If it doesn't work, that means that the linebreaking has not found any workable 
values. I hunt for last lines that almost fill the page as indications that \looseness=1 will work 
and use \looseness=1 on almost all paragraphs with short clubs. 

I don't see how I could do page balancing without it.

Indeed, nice color in screen output, awful symbols in the .log file.
