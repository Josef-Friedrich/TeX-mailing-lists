Hi folks
any idea what the \cbf and cemph commands do? \bf and \emph make 
sense. I did look around for an explanation but couldn't find any. I 
wonder if they're proprietary commands.
Many thanks
Paul

Equally interesting and *far more amusing* is to see and hear Koch

Of course, it would have helped if you'd mentioned where you saw them.
Anyway, I suspect they're just home-spun commands for doing bf, emph etc in
colour.

Subject: [texhax] natbib 'super' and hyperlinks
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.0902011519200.6851@coral>

Hello all,

I'm using natbib with 'super' and 'sort&compress' options.  In this 
situation, the links appear as tiny spaces below the superscripts, and 
clicking on the numbers themselves doesn't work.  This makes the hyperlink 
target very small and difficult to find.  Is this expected behavior?  Or 
do I have something wrong?

Thanks in advance,
-Brandon

\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage[super,sort&compress]{natbib}
\RequirePackage[colorlinks]{hyperref}

I expect it is, yes.  lmr10 was never intended to have the same metrics
as cmr10.

As for the particular change to the ic of f, I expect that the slightly
larger number simply looks better.  If in doubt, try making proofsheets
with gftodvi or fontforge or whatever, or look in the LM logs to see if
it was ever explicitly mentioned.

Message-ID: <EE02ED3EEDCDDC4EB103A288543389B611CDA126@AVN3VS004.ees.hhs.gov>


I couldn't find anything that addressed this so I'll try here - sorry if
it is the wrong kind of question:

I want to install/run TeXnic Center on both my home Windows and work
Windows machines.  The main issue is that I cannot write to the registry
on my work machine.

I installed everything on the home machine in the c: drive and
everything ran fine - thanks for the beautiful package.

I tried to install MikTex 2.7 on the c: drine on my work machine and it
gives me an error message that it cannot write to the registry.

Next step, I uninstalled everything and installed MikTeX + TeXnic Center
on a flash drive.  Now TeXnic Center starts fine and builds on my home
machine from the flash drive.  On the work machine TeXnic Center starts
fine but refuses to build.  I get an error message:

Initexmf.EXE: No formats.ini exists
(Fatal format file error: I'm stymied)

The formats.ini was originally in E:\MiKTeX 2.7\miktex\config but
copying it to other folders didn't help.

Any hints on how to fix this error or is it hopeless?  Any hints on how
to work around the registry problem in some other way?  Can it run off
of a DVD?  I like the flash drive because I can keep the working files
there and transport them back and forth.

Thanks
bob

I am trying to use lineno.sty with latex.

First, I went to CTAN, followed the instructions and downloaded the 
following files to my computer

  lineno.sty, edtable.sty, ednmath0.sty, ltabptch.sty and  longtable.sty 

Second, in a latex document I am trying to add line, I added at the to

When I try to compile the document, I keep getting the following error

Any suggestion to fix this problem or for using lineno.sty correctly with 
latex?

I expect \documentclass{minimal} would crash here since lineno.sty by 
default invokes \tiny to typeset line numbers, while \tiny is not defined 
under minimal.

I knew I should've taken a moment to either type ``(untested)'' or to  
test it.

Okay, \documentclass{article} then.


But apparently one needs some additional bit of code to turn on line  
numbering....

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{lineno}
\begin{document}

\linenumbers

Test.

Testing.

Testing 1, 2, 3

\end{document}

(tested)

If the above doesn't work for Joao, then there must be something wrong  
in the copy of lineno.sty which is being used.

This message is typical for typing errors in the document preamble ... or 
in a loaded package ... One should guess here that you have a broken 
version of lineno.sty ... but I wonder how this could have happened ... but 
that also is why I asked for your .log file which could tell me about the 
version of lineno.sty you are trying.

All the best,

As I told before, I am the maintainer of lineno.sty. I hope the license 
agreement (LPPL) made clear that I won't be responsible for another bank 
collapse. ;-)

On the other hand, I am just running out of money and preparing 
applications for donations supporting further development of lineno.sty (or 
...), cf.

     http://www.webdesign-bu.de/uwe_lueck/texproj.html#TODOs

(I do know about the TeX Development Fund.) Maybe I should demand one 
percent of ... from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York? ;-)

I am also looking for other small jobs concerning TeX.

Sorry if applications aren't welcome here ...

And sorry, I may be asleep for the next eight hours.

Cheers,

      Uwe.

Here is what was happening

I was doanloading the required files including lineno.sty from CTAN. When 
I was doing that, by clicking on "download" this would open the file in 
internet explorer. Then I would save it to my latex directory. This 
process somehow changed the file and this was the source of the problem.

I found out that another way to get that package was through miktex. In 
this case when you choose to download it yu can extract all of the 
required files straight to your directory without opening them and thus 
avoiding the problem mentioned above.

thanks for the help

I knew I should've taken a moment to either type ``(untested)'' or to 
test it.

Okay, \documentclass{article} then.


But apparently one needs some additional bit of code to turn on line 
numbering....

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{lineno}
\begin{document}

\linenumbers

Test.

Testing.

Testing 1, 2, 3

\end{document}

(tested)

If the above doesn't work for Joao, then there must be something wrong 
in the copy of lineno.sty which is being used.

First of all, this sounds like a question for the (excellent) MiKTeX list.

Secondly, how are you downloading and and installing the packages?  By hand
or using the MiKTeX Package Manager?

You mean like do a digest of the short and simple instructions (and

It's not really clear one can read the manual of wrapfig en the .sty  
itself ---at least in TeXLive, if you want the manual for, say,  
geometry, you just type in a terminal `` texdoc geometry '', and you  
can read all about the package in the geometry.pdf file. And that's  
the same, if memory serves, with all the packages I use..., except  
wrapfig.

If you do ---again, in TeXLive--- texdoc geometry, you're taken to the  
instructions... in Polish.

I learnt of wrapfig and learnt how to use it in TLC, 2nd ed.; much  
later I realized that at the bottom of the .sty file there were the  
instructions to use it.

Best,

Axel

Point taken: it was an old usage before the more professional era. 

Still, many sty files do at least contain hints as to how to use the
package.  And it usually is the case that if there isn't a proper manual,
then instructions are provided somewhere in the sty file.

If by information below you mean the caption, I use the sidecap.sty to  
place captions at the side of figures.

If you mean labels to the figures, I use the old but wonderful  
overpic.sty. As it's a bit complicated to get the documentation in  
"modern" pdf format, I'm risking the patience of this list by  
attaching the single page pdf file.

overpic can be used with both wrapfig or sidecap.

Axel

  Also, what to do with

  /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/wrapfig/multiple-span.txt ?

this raises (again) in my mind a couple of things:
(a) a long ago proposal for a .sty documentation reader, to deal with don's
way of doing things, and
(b) an idea of mine, just to write some docs (based on don's comments and
things like multiple-span.txt, and offer them to him for his approval.

it's a real pity that don's packages are seen as (somewhat) unapproachable
by users because they're not documented in a standard way.

Subject: [texhax] Address Book
Message-ID: <D80AC93D-7F18-4A22-BF51-96DCC73FBB17@easesoftware.com>

Hello,

I need to produce what is essentially an address book.  At least one  
section of the book, (the section I'm worried about) is a sequence of  
what I'll call "stanzas".  The first line is the person's name.  Then  
company.  Then address.  Then other items like web address, email,  
etc.  The end customer wants two column output and wants a stanza to  
not ever be split.  Then, whatever stanzas fit in a particular column  
will be equally spaced out.

I know TeX can do this fairly easily.  I've used TeX in the distant  
past.  Both Plain TeX and LaTeX.  The page also has some decorations  
like a line down the middle to divide the two columns and a header and  
page number in the footer.  Two sided output where the header flips on  
even and odd pages.

Questions:

1) Is there a pre-written set of macros that would give me a leg up on  
this?

2) I've used LaTeX and Plan TeX.  The default output of LaTeX never  
pleased me.  And, for that matter, Computer Modern Roman font never  
lite my fire either.  At the time (and environment) I used TeX, I  
could not switch fonts, etc.  (This was back in 1984-88 on a Unix  
machine.)  I'm using a Mac now with the latest Tug distribution.  Is  
changing fonts going to be a problem?

3) The classic question: would you recommend LaTeX or Plain TeX for  
this?  I'm leaning towards Plain TeX but its been a long time and I'm  
sure things have changed.  The other sections of the book are very  
trivial to format.

Thank you for your help and advice,
Perry

I don't see any problems about using LaTeX for this, I would using 
something like multicol(s) plus a minipage around each stanza.

regarding fonts, see http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/ for other samples

Hi, experts of the TeX program and basic font switching: Can the math font 
parameters as on p. 447 of the TeXbook be accessed directly through 
\fontdimen, or must I measure them through test boxes? Is there a way to 
make \font refer to "the current symbol font"? Whenever I try, \font seems 
to refer to the text \normalsized \normalfont. -- Uwe.

Dear forum,

is it possible to overlap the commands "underbrace" and "overbrace"? To 
be more specific, I want something like $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ with underbrace 
under aba^{-1} and overbrace over ba^{-1}b^{-1}. I hope there is an easy 
way to do this. Thanks.

Something like this:

------------------------------>%------------------------------
\def\uobrace#1#2#3{%
  \hbox to0pt{\mathsurround=0pt $\underbrace{#1#2}$\hss}
  \phantom{#1}
  \!\overbrace{\phantom{#2}#3}
}

$aba^{-1}b^{-1}$

$\uobrace{a}{ba^{-1}}{b^{-1}}$
------------------------------%<------------------------------


However, you have to be careful when operators occur at the
boundaries:

------------------------------>%------------------------------
$a\times ba^{-1} \times b^{-1}$

$\uobrace{a\times{}}{ba^{-1}\times{}}{b^{-1}}$

\vskip2pc

$a\times ba^{-1} \times b^{-1}$

$\uobrace{a\times{}}{ba^{-1}}{{}\times b^{-1}}$

\vskip2pc

$a\times ba^{-1} \times b^{-1}$

$\uobrace{a}{{}\times ba^{-1}}{{}\times b^{-1}}$
------------------------------%<------------------------------


It would be nice if the space on the outside of an operator was not
covered by a brace, but that would become too complex I think.
Hopefully you don't need this :).

Oleg

Perhaps better, in that it adjusts the size automatically is, for example,
$$
y = \left. \left(\frac{a+b}{c+d}\right)  \right/  
\left(\frac{e+f}{g+h}\right)
$$
The \left. matches the \right/ and sets the / to the size of what's 
between them. 
One could instead use \left/ ..... \right. if the denominator were 
bigger and needed a larger /

You'll get incorrect spacing.  Compare:

------------------------------%<------------------------------
$$
y = \left. \left({a+b \over c+d}\right)  \right/
\left({e+f \over g+h}\right)

That day when i enquired about the MikTex package installation you
gave me a big note which i am unable to understand. Anyhow i have some
doubts now: I went to the MikTex browse packages option and then i
searched for the mnsymbol package.It was not installed. I right
clicked to give the installationbut the speed which it downloading is
very slow. Already i had downloaded the package from CTAN.

Now i went to the change repository option and then gave the command
of installing package from a directory. But its always showing that
this is not a repository option. Can i improve on this so as to
install the package by hand.

I think you are looking for

\xheight = \fontdimen 5 \textfont 2 \relax

I think what you're looking for is this:

$$
  \left.\frac12\middle/\frac12\right.
$$

The command \middle was mentioned in threasd ("parenthesis problem in
LaTeX") a couple of weeks ago.

Unfortunately, I don't know how to install packages in MiKTeX, but I  
know MiKTeX lets you choose from a long list of servers to upgrade or  
download packages ---if some server is very slow, try another.

Thanks for all the suggestions.  I am using the versions of TeX  
distributed with TeXShop, and I know nothing about eTeX, but I think  
\middle is not recognized by my version of TeX:  I get either an error  
message (missing delimiter) or no error, and no slash.  However, this  
probably is the right kind of macro to use for this problem.

I had somehow overlooked the fact that "/" is included in table 8.3 of  
TLC2, so was under the impression that it was not extensible, and  
therefore didn't take "\big" etc. or "\left".  When the next version  
of TLC comes out, there should be an index entry that leads you to this.

In any case, I was lucky here:  the numerator and denominator are  
roughly of the same size, so "\left/...\right." works fine.  Thanks  
again.

The nomination period for the positions of TUG President and TUG
Board members has passed. I have received the following information
from Robin Laakso, Executive Director of TUG.

President

Karl Berry was nominated for President. As there were no other
nominees, he is duly elected and will serve for another two years.

Board of Directors

The following individuals were nominated for the Board of Directors:

Jonathan Fine
Steve Grathwohl
Jim Hefferon
Klaus Hoeppner
Steve Peter
David Walden

As there were fewer nominations than open positions, all the nominees
are duly elected to a four-year term.

Terms for President and Members of the Board of Directors will begin
with the Annual Meeting at the University of Notre Dame.
Congratulations to all.

Dick Koch, Martha Kummerer and Arthur Ogawa have decided to step down
at the end of their terms.  On behalf of the Board, I wish to thank them
for their service, and for their continued participation through July.

The background information provided in support of the candidates will
be posted shortly on the TUG web site.

Subject: [texhax] Plain TeX: shorter `rightarrow' needed
Message-ID: <87skmolmis.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi.

In order to denote an oriented $\Gamma$ line, I need to put a small rightarrow
over the $\Gamma$ symbol, such that the plain TeX $\rightarrow$ is too long.

Is there a way to get that, and how?

Thanks for any reply
Rodolfo

"Missing $ inserted", otherwise I don't like that the arrow is italic while 
Gamma is not. $\mathit{\vec{\Gamma}}$ and 
$\mathop{\Gamma}^{\scriptscriptstyle\to}$ are bad as well. Placing 
something on top of a capital letter is problematic in general. Note that 
in (classical) Greek, diacritical marks are not set on top of capital 
letters, but on their left (learnt this from Claudio Beccari, cf. my 
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/R?ter), or already that limits of sum or 
integral symbols are set on their right in inline mode. What is the 
convention in this field?

Working with MiKTeX may be painful in the beginning, but with some patience 
and trust in MiKTeX as well as in your guessing you will become friends 
with MiKTeX -- this is my experience. Sometimes the bar showing the 
progress of a task doesn't work and you don't know for a while whether 
MiKTeX is working or hang-up ... sometimes it is fine after some minutes, 
otherwise try again ... as with so many other machines and ... I wonder 
what will happen if I remind of the patience and trust of a, say, ... bus 
driver ...

As Axel says, MiKTeX offers you to choose among server repositories, and 
you will certainly find one which works.

To remind of what Philip Ratcliffe remarked earlier, there is a special 
mailing list for MiKTeX users:

     List-Subscribe: 
<https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/miktex-users>,
     <mailto:miktex-users-request at lists.sourceforge.net?subject=subscribe>

Thanks a lot, this has lifted my knowledge of TeX to a new level. I was 
unable to make sense of TeXbook pp. 153 so far, now I compared p. 351. 
(Another instance of Knuth's magic: read the page number from right to 
left, and you find the corresponding page in the appendix or vice versa ...)

Now I wonder a little whether I can be sure that (outside PlainTeX) 2 will 
be the symbols family.

Actually I was looking for axis_height, going to explain later ... Some 
time ago I looked for x_height of \scriptstyle or so.

$\vbox{\ialign{#\crcr$\scriptscriptstyle\to$\crcr\noalign
                           {\kern.5pt\nointerlineskip}%
                                $\hfil\displaystyle{\Gamma}\hfil$\crcr}}$

(see definition of \overerightarrow in the TeXbook) looks very nice.

    Now I wonder a little whether I can be sure that (outside PlainTeX) 2 will 
    be the symbols family.

Yes.  It is built into TeX: The Program that family 2 is the symbols
family (and 3 is math extension).  The math typesetting code takes
dimens from those families.

I believe it is not strictly necessary that family 1 be math italic, but
I'm not sure anyone has gone against it in practice.

Yes, families 0, 1, 2, and 3 are guaranteed to have the same meaning.
The special math fontdimen parameters from the symbol and extension fonts
are required in the fonts for families 2 and 3 for TeX to typeset math.
See the first page of Appendix G.

Indeed, expressly. I may have asked a wrong question. TeX doesn't care 
about where cmsy or so is, it just acts on what it finds in family 2.

This led me to think about vertical placement of labels near marks of 
certain points in the plain, and I wondered how \makebox(0,0) has been used 
to obtain this. A main application may be labelling the "tic" marks of the 
vertical axis of a diagram.

I am curious about general conventions here, while I haven't tried to draw 
x-y-diagrams so far. (You can adapt your field of research to your 
graphical abilities, cf. 
http://www.webdesign-bu.de/uwe_lueck/writings.html). The PS-Tricks people 
may have clear convictions about this.

\makebox(0,0){foo} (LaTeX picture environment) centers `foo' essentially by 
\vbox{\vss\hbox{foo}\vss}. With \put(<x>,<y>){\makebox(0,0){foo}}, <y> is 
half between top and bottom of `f' (their y-coordinates).

So consider alignment of `b' and `p' in 
\put(<x>,<y>){\makebox(0,0){b\quad}\_\makebox(0,0){\quad p}}. Tops of `b' 
and `p' are aligned, likewise their bottoms, half in between the horizontal 
stroke. This horizontal stroke may be a tic mark on the vertical axis of an 
x-y-diagram.

I think this is ridiculous, `b' and `p' should share a common baseline. I 
think that the label for a mark at vertical position <y> should have its 
*axis* at <y>, not half between its top and bottom. *axis* is here the 
vertical position of *fraction strokes* (those horizontal lines between 
numerators and denominators). I feel that this is the natural vertical 
"center" of a line.

To keep some touch with reality, I would like to consider the case that the 
vertical axis of a diagram refers to an amount of *water*, in terms of g 
(grams) as well as in terms of ml (1/1000 litres). Due to different \dp and 
\hp (while there sums are the same), the names nad numbers of the units 
would have different base lines.

Therefore I thought that vertical centering of `foo' around (<x>,<y>) 
should be just \put(<x>,<y>){$\lower\axisheight\hbox{foo}$}, with 
\def\axisheight{\fontdimen22\textfont2\relax}. I would replace \makebox(0,0) by

     \newcommand*{\piczzbox}[1]{%
         $\m at th\raisebox{-\fontdimen22\textfont2}[\z@][\z@]%
                        {\hb at xt@\z@{\hss#1\hss}}$}

Complete example:

     \setlength{\unitlength}{1in}
     \begin{picture}(5,4)
       \put(2,2){\makebox(0,0){b\quad}\_\makebox(0,0){\quad p}}
       \put(4,2){\piczzbox{b\quad}\_\piczzbox{\quad p}}
     \end{picture}

Opinions? Or is this well-known? Of course the question may rise rarely, 
axis tics usually are numbered, labels usually have same \dp and \ht.

Cheers,

     Uwe.

Happy New Year! (Compare year numbers.) I found this in searching my texhax 
box and therefore comment it here, although previously I planned to tell 
about this to the TeXLive maintainers only.

I have bought a similar problem, namely Acer One with "Linpus Linux Lite", 
indeed in order to drill myself hard. Before installing TeX, I learnt that 
this is a kind of Fedora 9 and I should use RPM (Red Hat package managing, 
yum ...). This is quite a restriction, I found a TeXLive 2007 RPM which, 
among other lacunae, didn't install any DVI viewer. Anyway, I have found 
reviews telling that this Acer One Linpus Linux is ridiculous, and I was 
advised to replace it by Ubuntu (I doubt ...)

I wondered much what will happen if I follow the TeXLive instructions 
instead, will this break the RPM structure? In the meantime, I have tried 
to install an XDVI separately, I found nothing but the teTeX version, its 
buttons don't work. I tend to think that the problem is not so much the 
name of the Linux distribution, rather: as a number of flaws of this Acer 
One Linux have been reported and I have found more of them, any failures of 
TeXLive installations on my tiny netbook may be due to flaws in its special 
operating system.

So I developped the view that the rise of "netbooks" in 2008 that were 
equipped with somewhat obscure Linux blends need special care from the TeX 
users community.

However, I wonder how many TeX users have bought such netbooks with Linux. 
It seems that netbooks originally were equipped with Linux just because 
Windows was too large. Microsoft had announced the end of Windows XP, but 
then it was revived for those netbooks. I wonder: has this made Linux on 
netbooks irrelevant? On the other hand, I have seen issues of computer 
magazines devoted to Ubuntu on netbooks.

Puuh ..., cheers,

     Uwe.

I installed TexLive 2007 from the TexLive DVD some time ago on an SD
card in an ASUS Eeepc 4G.  As far as I remember the only problem was
thah the  external DVD drive mounted in a directory that had white
spaces and the TeXLive install script failed.  When I umounted the
drive and and remounted to a directory with no space in the name the
install script ran perfectly and the TeX programs all worked.  I was
also able to install an old version of TexMaker from the ASUS
repository and get it working.  The ASUS screen was a little small for
the program.  Later versions of TeXmaker would not install.  Vim is on
the ASUS and I probably should have looked at using it.  Despite the
small screen the 4G is the very quick to access email and internet.  I
have also got a reasonable R system working on the 4G.

I have lately installed Ubuntu 8.10 on an SD card attached to the
EeePc 4G and have installed TeXLive 2008 (from the TeXLive DVD) on
that system.  It also appears to be working.  This is recreational
and, at the moment, I do not have the time to refine this system (get
wireless working  etc.)  If I had time the Ubuntu version is the more
attractive  despite a much slower boot.

Best Regards

John

This is best done in the text editor. For Vim the command would be

:%s/XU/(code for your metafont symbols)/g

Or you can simply create a macro thus:
\def\XU{code for your metafont symbol}

The above is primitive TeX code but works for LaTeX also.

Obviously, you haven't; it was sort of destined to failure: \left looks for
\right and then tries to work with what's inbetween and that includes
\mathord{ with now a missing right brace.

One could, of course, do something using a macro with arguments to correct
the spacing, but ... \middle is so much easier.

    I wondered much what will happen if I follow the TeXLive instructions 
    instead, will this break the RPM structure? 

If you install the "native" TL as downloaded from CTAN or wherever, it
will (by default) be completely independent of your native OS packaging
of TeX.  The default installation location is under /usr/local.

Hi Karl,
\middle is not new.  It exists in e-TeX as far as I can remember.  The
file "etex_man.pdf" I mentioned in a previous thread is from March 1998.

The reason that \middle is not mentioned in any manual except the
e-TeX manual itself is that most people are not aware that all engines
are using e-TeX now.  As far as I remember, it was David Kastrup who
asked for integrating e-TeX into LaTeX.  He had been interested in the
advanced debugging functions provided by e-TeX in the first place.
Everything happened in the background, hence it's no wonder that most
people are not aware of the "new" features.

So let me provide the link again, for everybody who is interested:

  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/e-tex/v2/doc/etex_man.pdf

Regards,
  Reinhard

Is it really true that \middle is unknown to plain TeX.  I find that 
hard to believe,
because I know that I have used it to create some non-mathematical displays.
I also know that I did not use e-TeX, (not because I have any hostility to
it---far from it---but simply because I didn't have to, and I tend to 
find plain
TeX solutions whenever I can). 

I do not have the time to dig around for the source of my awareness of
\middle,  but I am pretty sure that a serious user of plain TeX would
be able to discover it.

Well, I presume that one could conceivablly make X an active character and
then define it as a macro to test the following charcter and act
accordingly, but I think that would be like playing with fire.

You *did* use e-TeX (or rather, plain pdfTeX). Try with the example  
Reinhard Kotucha is referring to (adapted from the original LaTeX):

$$
H =
P_{\hbox{ring}}   \times \left( -\log_2 ( P_{\hbox{ring}})   \middle)
+
P_{\hbox{silent}} \times \middle( -\log_2 ( P_{\hbox{silent}}) \right)
$$
\bye

If you *really* use TeX (not pdfTeX) you'll get

! Undefined control sequence.
l.3 ...\left( -\log_2 ( P_{\hbox{ring}})   \middle
                                                   )

Now try the same with pdfTeX and everything will typeset OK.

Best,

Axel

Would typing \XU be good for you? In this case, you can just use

\usepackage{xspace}
\newcommand{\XU}{replacement string\xspace}

The macros and example in the attached wawansub.tex may be a solution. I 
just found Nicola Talbot's datatool.sty (requires substr.sty and xfor.sty) 
for replacement, while there may be other useful packages xstring.sty or under

     http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#parsingfiles

The substitutions must be declared in the definition of \xreplacements.

There is a number of difficulties with such operations. The present 
implementation breaks when you try to embed another environment, and it 
ignores the content of curly braces. I have another version which looks 
inside braces but disables macros with arguments. This can hardly be 
improved without considerably more work.

With the present implementation the environment `substitute' must not 
contain \par.

I wonder about `my symbols from metafont' since we are just manipulating 
tokens, not glyphs as metafont produces them. Maybe you are using some rich 
encoding like Unicode, otherwise you may introduce certain commands to call 
your glyphs.

Instead of previous/below on makebox(0,0), I could have done without 
axis_height and my \piczzbox by just saying that \makebox(0,0){...} should 
contain \mathstrut, at least when heights or depths of labels vary, or 
sometimes perhaps \vphantom{\big(}, or ... . My summing-up example then reads:

     \setlength{\unitlength}{1in}
     \begin{picture}(5,4)
       \put(2,2){\makebox(0,0){b\quad}\_\makebox(0,0){\quad p}} %% bad
       \put(4,2){\makebox(0,0){b\mathstrut\quad}\_\makebox(0,0){\quad 
p\mathstrut}} %% fine
     \end{picture}

Until now I had understood this as if you put symbols near marks to refer 
to certain (marked) points of the diagram in the text nearby. I was about 
to explain that you could "combine" labels with marks by

     \put(<x0>,<y0>){\put(<x1>,<y1>){\makebox(0,0){<label>}}<mark>}

or more sophisticated ... This came from the thread name `Combing symbols' ...

Now however it seems to me that you don't want to combine anything, just 
center something on a coordinate. This really should not be done by 
shifting ..., but by

     \put(<x>,<y>){\makebox(0,0){<symbol>}}

or with lowercase letters perhaps, according to my previous posting,

     \put(<x>,<y>){\makebox(0,0){<symbol>\mathstrut}}

My TLC1 (German) p. 289 seems to tell me that it is standard to center 
symbols in picture environments this way (without \mathstrut).

You need to know about category codes here, how to change them, and how to 
work with unusual category codes. Things are easier when one doesn't try to 
substitute and to typeset "at the same time". The next step to handle curly 
braces properly could be reading them as "other" first, write the replacing 
result to disk, \input that with usual category codes. The fancyvrb package 
may me useful for some steps of this.

You might reason whether your actual task is worth such efforts. If the 
task arises all the time with new projects and with a large number of 
different strings, this may be the case. I have made such a thing, yet I 
can't release it as it is. This works on entire files, not environments.

Subject: [texhax] Changing \skip\footins locally
Message-ID: <F7DA6F6A-B027-4AEB-BECB-EDB5C8CD4425@telecom-bretagne.eu>

I would like to fit an extra line of text in a specific page with  
footnotes. When I attempt to change \skip\footins on that page only,  
it has no effect whatsoever. I realized that only when I change \skip 
\footins in the LaTeX preamble it has some effect on the typeset result.

How can I change locally (for one page only) the blank space between  
text and footnote so that I can fit an additional line of text on that  
page, without changing footnote behaviour for the rest of the document?

Thanks in advance

Yannis

I find it somewhat contradictory to expect extra space for text by 
reserving extra white space.

Since pagebreaking, including breaking footnotes, depends on quite a number 
of parameters, notably penalty values, and on the special distribution of 
demerits in the main vertical list, it is not easy to help you here. E.g., 
the line you want to have on the same page may have a footnote whose first 
line just doesn't fit on the same page.

Perhaps it would work to decrease \dimen\footins. On a final stage of the 
work, I would just try  \pagebreak and \nopagebreak (I am not sure about 
\enlargethispage, is it still supported?). But we know too little of your 
situation.

Sorry,

     Uwe.

If you do want to embark on this foolish quest :-), perhaps the xstring
package might help?

Even if the task arises frequently, a simple sed script (or similar)
will be far quicker to write, easier to maintain, more robust...and
generally better in almost every way. In my experience, string
substitution is just not a task that LaTeX is well suited to. It's not
difficult to integrate running your source through a sed script into
your LaTeX build procedure (you could even write a quick Makefile).

HTH,

Toby

I tried to reduce \skip\footins, not to increase it

No, no. I know that such an action should remain exceptional, and this  
is what I need: an exceptional way to decrease \footins on a single  
page.

> Perhaps it would work to decrease \dimen\footins.

Is \dimen\footins different than \skip\footins???

Several people suggested I use \enlargethispage. I think you don't  
understand the problem: I want to insert an extra line of text,  
_without moving neither the text upwards, nor the footnotes downwards_.

\pagebreak works if you want lesser lines, I need an extra line.  
\nopagebreak has never worked. If I use a box to force the extra line  
of text, the footnote is broken.

I really need a means to fiddle with \footins on a single page. And I  
have the impression that (La)TeX does not allow fine-enough control on  
footnotes...

Thanks

If you don't mind an unbalanced spread, try going right into the primitives

\dimen0=\pagegoal\advance\dimen0 by 
\value_of_baselineskip-expressed_as_a_dimension\pagegoal=\dimen0

Sometimes the extra line comes in without pushing the footnote down 
noticeably.  The page breaker can occasionally be triggered by half a 
point or less,  and most people won't see that.  You can substitute 
smaller and smaller dimensions for 
\value_of_baselineskip-expressed_as_a_dimension to see just how much is 
needed.  It can be a real surprise.

Here's a try at a solution.  It appends a \changefoot command to the end
of the \output routine.  By redefining \changefoot, you can sneak
changes into the page measurements, and have them reflected in the pages
you're outputting.

Warning: this isn't what you'd call kosher, since messing with \output
often has unexpected consequences, but in the context of trying to muck
around with the final copy of a particular book, you may find it useful.
Note that I think you'll need to change the \changefoot definition
somewhere on the previous page to the one you're trying to fidget with.
But mess around with this, and I bet you'll see how to make it work for
you.

Hope this helps,

Thanks for your kind words. I tried it but it doesn't change anything.  
Maybe is this due to the fact I'm using the manyfoot package? Anyway,  
I continue fiddling around with \changefoot...

Probably so.  The manyfoot packages also tampers with \output.  All may
not be lost, but it's up to you to tamper further.  The trick I showed
you puts the \changefoot call at the end of whatever else goes on in the
\output routine.  Perhaps you can look inside the manyfoot code to see
if there's a measurement you can mess with instead of \skip\footins?
That is, whatever goes into \changefoot will override whatever the
manyfoot modifications did.  

Hope that helps,

Subject: [texhax] if condition: is macro body empty?
Message-ID: <20090211180457.GD5420@eureca.de>

Hi folk,

for (pdf)latex I am looking for a way to check whether the body of a macro
is empty or not. At the moment, I use a construct using \equal{}{<macro>},
but I have the impression that during evaluation of this construct some
ugly side effects occur. I am sure there must be a better way.

Here's a short example (the final thing is much more complex, the \buffer
being filled with parts of an \item list or with parts of a tabular):

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{ifthen}
\newcommand{\buffer}{}
\makeatletter
% close to what I need:
\newcommand{\fillbuffer}[1]{%
	\ifthenelse{\equal{\buffer}{}}%
	{\g at addto@macro{\buffer}{#1}}
	{\g at addto@macro{\buffer}{\newline #1}}
}
\makeatother
\begin{document}

Filling the buffer may be called or not, and done here.
\fillbuffer{First part.}
\fillbuffer{Second part.}

Now use the contents of this buffer:

\buffer

\end{document}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Any ideas please?

	Susan

Message-ID: <200902111914.n1BJEoM22684@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

First, the upcoming 2009 TeX conferences:

- BachoTeX 2009 will be held in Bachotek, Poland, from
  April 29-May 3, 2009.  Deadline for abstracts: March 8.
  http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2009/main-en.html

- TUG 2009 will be held at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame,
  Indiana, USA, from July 28-31, 2009.
  Deadline for abstracts: April 13.
  Early bird registration deadline: April 27.
  http://tug.org/tug2009/

- EuroTeX 2009 will be held in The Hague, The Netherlands, from
  August 31-September 4, 2009.
  Early bird registration deadline: February 15.
  Deadline for abstracts: April 30.
  http://www.ntg.nl/EuroTeX2009/

In other news:

- TUG will apply to participate in the Google Summer of Code again
  this year; Arthur Reutenauer (GUT president) and I will administer it.
  We will not know whether we are accepted for some time, but Google
  recommends getting started early.  So project ideas are welcome,
  especially from prospective mentors and prospective students.
  http://tug.org/gsoc/

- We are pleased to announce that the TeX development fund matching
  program was again successful.  We matched the available $10,000 from
  our anonymous benefactor in less than five months, due to very
  generous donations from over 50 individuals and organizations.  I'd
  like to highlight the work done by Idris Hamid, of Colorado State
  University, who has successfully advocated for funds for TeX
  development from several different institutions, and was instrumental
  in making the match happen so quickly.
  http://tug.org/tc/devfund/

- We are also pleased to announce that TUG and the Italian TeX user
  group, GuIT, have agreed to offer joint memberships.  Details are on
  the GuIT page, http://www.guit.sssup.it/guit/adesione.php.  GuIT joins
  DANTE, DK-TUG, NTG, and UK-TUG in offering joint memberships with TUG.
  We are happy to be in such good company.

- Finally, election results have been sent separately, and are also
  posted at http://tug.org/election.  No ballot will be needed this
  year.  The main news: welcome to Jonathan Fine!  He will be a new TUG
  board member as of TUG 2009.  As it happens, an interview with
  Jonathan was recently posted in the Interview Corner:
  http://tug.org/interviews/


As always, we appreciate your support,
Karl Berry (President) on behalf of the TUG Board

Start a group ({) *before* the first footnote in that page (and I  
would \protect'ed anyway).

{\protect\setlength{\skip\footins}{2pt}% <- adjust to your needs
<Paragraph with first footnote in page\footnote{...}>

...

<Paragraph *after* text in said page>% <- you might need to experiment
}% <-close group

I would be very careful as to how the rest of the chapter behaves.

Best,

Axel

P.S. I do use manyfoot as well.

As far as I know Type 1's for BBM have never been created.

Perhaps someone would like to do some autotracing a la cm-super ...

Yes, we are talking about the same thing.

\skip\footins is white space, \dimen\footins is maximum height for 
footnotes, TeXbook p. 122f.

Clearly; as too \enlargethispage, I have myself never understood what it 
really does, neither from the documentation nor from the code, I only 
experienced that it sometimes allows some extra text line on the same page.

>\pagebreak works if you want lesser lines, I need an extra line.

No, \pagebreak may also add a line, see next:

>\nopagebreak has never worked.

I know this. I want to have line n+1 together with n on the current page, I 
issue \nopagebreak in line n, it goes to the next page together with line 
n+1. And so on the more \nopagebreak I try. But often (I believe to 
remember) I succeeded by forcing the page break between line n+1 and n+2 to 
get line n+1 on the current page. Only this may convince TeX that breaking 
after n+1 is better than breaking after n. This may have to do with the 
fact that negative/small penalties override positive/big penalties (a real 
pity).

>If I use a box to force the extra line of text, the footnote is broken.

If you want to avoid even this, you seem to demand something very 
difficult. Unless you accept negative \skip\footins (I had a similar effect 
in my early months with manyfoot), you ... might increase the shrink of of 
\baselineskip!??

>I really need a means to fiddle with \footins on a single page. And I
>have the impression that (La)TeX does not allow fine-enough control on
>footnotes...

Being puzzled by (La)TeX's page-breaking is a common feeling, that's my 
impression. (And from 2003 to 2008, I earnt my living with manyfoot.) That 
is why I find

     Happy TeXing!

so cynical. More outright, as we Germans say:

     "Hals- und Beinbruch!"
     ("Happy breaking your neck and leg!" Cf. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/break_a_leg)

My original main message was: I don't believe in general rules here! You 
might rather send those two pages! Or a starting point for a remote 
diagnosis might be the \tracingpages outcome according to TeXbook p. 122f.

"Hals- und Beinbruch!"

     Uwe.

I *does* work. I tested it before sending the message. Of course,  
(La)TeX has to have room for that extra line between the normal last  
line and the footnote, or has to be able to shrink the text somewhere  
(enumerations, quotes or the like).

I'll send you privately the gridded page with which I made the test,  
both before and after the change.

Best,

Axel

Hi

In Miktex for latex files is there any way for track changes like MS-WORD, other than "latexdiff". 


Thanks

Thanks, Daleif, for your answer. I had a look at ifmtarg, but could not get
it to work at all in the case I need. Perhaps because I do not really
understand the \expandafter magic.
My impression is that \@ifmtarg{\buffer}{YES}{NO} will always typeset NO
no matter what the contents of \buffer is.

I continued trying and came closer to understand what it is that does not
work:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{ifthen}

\newcommand{\buffer}{}
\makeatletter
\newcommand{\fillbuffer}[1]{%
	\g at addto@macro{\buffer}{\item #1}%
}
\makeatother

\begin{document}

% create a list of items:
\fillbuffer{First part.}
\fillbuffer{Second part.}
\fillbuffer{Third part.}
\fillbuffer{Fourth part.}

% now print the item list:

This works: 
\begin{itemize}
\buffer
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately I need some conditionals like this:
%\ifthenelse{\equal{\buffer}{}}{}{%
%	\begin{itemize}
%	\buffer
%	\end{itemize}
%}%

\end{document}

If I remove the first itemize block and activate the second, the error
message is:

! Use of \@item doesn't match its definition.
\@ifnextchar ...eserved at d =#1\def \reserved at a {#2}
                                                  \def \reserved at b
{#3}\futu...
l.24 \ifthenelse{\equal{\buffer}{}}
                                   {}{%
?



If I keep the first itemize block and activate the second, the error
message is:

! Undefined control sequence.
\itemize ...nce \@itemdepth \@ne \edef \@itemitem 
                                                  {labelitem\romannumeral
\t...
l.24 \ifthenelse{\equal{\buffer}{}}
                                   {}{%

Time is pressing and I do not know where to look for alternatives :-(

Any hints are greatly appreciated,

	Susan

This works too, doesn't need the "ifthen" package and shouldn't expand the
macro:

\newcommand{\buffer}{\relax}
\makeatletter
\newcommand{\fillbuffer}[1]{%
  \if\buffer\relax
    \g at addto@macro{\buffer}{#1}%
  \else
    \g at addto@macro{\buffer}{\newline #1}%
  \fi
}
\makeatother

\expandafter\@ifmtarg\expandafter{\buffer}{YES}{NO}

not sure if both \expandafter's are needed, but this is hos I use it.

Sorry, I should've been more carefully.  The following does work properly
(i.e., it's ok even when \buffer remains empty).  Evidently, \newcommand
does something strange (I left it in for the useual protection against
inadvertently overwriting a previous definition), but \def is obviously
cleaner.  The conditional should then also be \ifx and not \if.

\documentclass{article}

\newcommand\buffer{}
\def\buffer{}
\makeatletter
\newcommand{\fillbuffer}[1]{%
	\g at addto@macro{\buffer}{\item #1}%
}
\makeatother

\begin{document}

% create a list of items:
\fillbuffer{First part.}

No, not as such.  In the WinEdt repositories there is a package that defines
some useful macros ... it's all done very much by hand though, which is
probaly not what you want.

Let's start a support group ({) of manyfoot users [abusers/addicts] 
*before* nobody can \protect us anymore!

In my earlier posting, I had pointed to

     http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/bytopic.html#parsingfiles

-- some offers from which to choose, I choosed which worked at once; it is 
especially helpful if the string to be manipulated is not addressed by an 
explicit list but by a macro name.

I am thinking of users who don't know other program languages than TeX 
and/or for whom TeX is most easily accessible, or who rather understand 
documentations of (La)TeX packages than of other programs. ted (bytopic) is 
a "TeX substitute" for sed.

Cheers,

     Uwe.

Many thanks to daleif and Phil!
I'll use daleif's version as I got that to work in my case. I guess I would
just have to dig a bit deeper to use your version, Phil, but as I said time
is pressing. I'll leave digging into it until I next need a construct
as that one.

Again, lots of thanks!

Do you know about the resum?s of changes that package authors usually 
provide? You would see them most easily, if only in a very condensed form, 
by (subscribing and) reading the CTAN announcement mailing list, whenever a 
package update is uploaded.

A tricky solution is shorter:

but it is slightly wrong for the "empty" buffer case.

1. If you work with Perl anyway, then I don't understand why you want to 
use LaTeX for replacements instead of Perl.

2. To the best of my knowledge, the ifthen package would be of almost no 
use here. You would need some string handling macros, I pointed to some 
packages offering such macros. ifthen only can decide whether two given 
strings are the same.

3. I have offered a probable solution, what are you missing for a ".sty" now?

Subject: [texhax] \url with space (%20)
Message-ID: <135E2FA6-2D16-4A68-AED8-CEF6A3413D99@asu.edu>

Hello guys,

I'm new to this email list.  I looked in the archives and found  
related topics, but not the answer I'm looking for:

To write my thesis I'm using apacite and BibTeX.  In the bib file I  
have a reference that contains a URL and I'm using \url.  My problem  
is that the URL contains a space (which is replaced with "%20" by the  
browser).  We all know that % begins a comment on that line, so in  
order to escape, we use a \ in front of the %.  However, what happens  
to my bib entry is that it ends up printing the \ before the %20 so  
the URL will be invalid when "copy-pasted" from the PDF.  How can I  
not print the escape character '\' in the URL and still print the % 
20?  I also tried leaving a space between "Alternative" and "methods"  
instead of using the \%20 but the \url package ignored the space and  
merged the two words (which is also inccorect).

This is my entry:

@misc{Ludescher2006,
   title = {The {D}irect {M}ethod},
   author = {Ludescher, Franz},
   year  = {2006},
   howpublished = {Retrieved January 29, 2009, from:

direct_method.htm}\bibnodot{.}}
}

Thanks!

I'm needing to write some TeX macros for title pages, and being able to

Does anyone here know of work done on this topic since Don's original post?

this works just fine for me, no need to escape, bibtex does not look at 
the contents, so this example should be enough

Ah, these are good news! For what I see the first packages to use  
expl3 code are the ones you and Will Robertson maintain (good news for  
XeTeX users then); and to those packages we have to add xfrac, which  
already depends on expl3, right?

We will be notified when those new versions are uploaded to TeX Live  
repositories, right? For example, I use mathtools and xfrac;  
therefore, I would like to know when the new versions reach TL, in  
order to check that there are no reflows in my documents.

Thank you again.

Hello Great List,

I have a simple question but not really having any luck doing any interweb
searches.

Using natbib I would like to produce a citation like this

(Chapman, 1988; see Rex & Petticrew 2008)

Now I normally produce ``see'' like this:

\citep[see][]{rex2008}

My quandary is how to place the ``see'' after the first citation and also
after the semi-colon.

I'm sure this is simple so I apologize for my naivety.

Thanks in advance

Sam

When I upload packages to ctan, there is always an announcement on  
comp.text.tex. Will and I will of course ensure that whatever we put on  
CTAN of our own package remains in sync with what we in the project team  
has released as expl3 and xpackages.

You are very welcome. The next release of expl3 should see some major  
improvements, some of which have been outlined at  
<http://www.texdev.net/2009/02/13/latex3-argument-specifiers-improvements/>.

I don't see any problem that needs solving.  Or maybe the impulse
to use "\vskip2cm" instead of "\baselineskip=2cm" can be called
the problem.

Hmm, for multi-line text it does look hard to use a different 
\baselineskip between paragraphs and within the paragraph.

You could try

This kind of stuff is documented in the comments at the start of

If you are a purist, you'd write your own macros using pdftex
primitives.  Otherwise, you can use one of the packages for plain TeX
which already do that for you.  My favorite is http://tug.org/eplain/ :).

BTW, Eplain will also let you use many features of LaTeX's graphics
package.  It uses miniltx.tex which is usable outside of Eplain, but
Eplain enables some additional features.

Before using Metapost-generated EPS files with pdftex, you'd need to
convert them to PDF.  There are many options, if I remember the names
correctly:  epstopdf, mptopdf, convert (from ImageMagick),
epstopdf.sty which can load and convert metapost EPS on the fly, etc.

HTH,
Oleg

Thanks.

I need cross-reference hyperlinks, that eplain produces with the commands
\definexref and \refn.  Only, I need also cross-file xrefs, i.e. the
possibility of jumping from one pdf file to another with cross-reference
hyperlinks.  I manage to do that between different dvi files and I wish to do
the same also with pdf format.

Is that difficult?

Thanks
Rodolfo

It's a superscript -- example: $\sin^{-1}x$.

Hi,

I have this question:
I am an artist and I have this ID with Math fonts.

Now I want to generate Math fonts with Plaintex for later use but for
technical reasons these need to be made as Outline fonts!
(see example {arialichollow} below)

Question:
Is it possible to generate 'Outline fonts' in PlainTex?
Could you give some directions to do this ?

Thanks in advance

TeX only sees metrics, so whatever your fonts look like doesn't matter  
for TeX. I would advise you to take existing math fonts, convert them  
into outlines using some tool (like Fontographer or Fontlab), while  
keeping the same metrics so that you can use the same TeX metrics  
(cmmi10, cmsy10, etc.), only change their names so there is no  
conflict. If you have to enlarge glyphs then you will have to modify  
the metric files (by transforming TFM into PL), be careful to keep all  
the font parameters including NUM*, DENOM*, BIGOPSPACING*, NEXTLARGER,  
etc. otherwise the math stuff will not work.

So, to keep it short: what makes a math font being "math" is the  
existence of extra values in the metric files, the glyphs can be  
arbitrary. If you take existing math fonts and transform their glyphs  
without changing their widths then you can keep the same metric files  
with different names.

If you have other questions don't hesitate to ask

Subject: [texhax] Numbering/labeling verbatim code segments in a document
Message-ID: <200902151805.28376.gingrich@rmit.edu.au>

I'm sorry to bother folks with what I suspect is a simple
problem.

I've got a big document with a number of 68K assembler
code segments embedded in the verbatim environment.

Since I am copying these code segments to proper source
files and testing them, I would like to:

1) Have them numbered/identified as <chapter>.<segment>
   in the text
2) Have them captioned with a short description of what
   they do so that I could have the equivalent of a 
   table of figures that meaningfully lists the code 
   snippets, where they are in the text and the description

This also means that, if I pass the original files to the 
students, they will be able to easily load and experiment with 
the code while reading the text.

Possibilities that I have considered:

some of the code environments - but none seem to do quite the right
thing.

looked at the equation stuff too, but that doesn't look right either.

Sorry to impose, but I'm right up against a deadline.

Thanks,

-Don

why don't you have a look at the listings package, it is great for this 
sort of thing. THen you can keep your code in external files and just 
input the segments you want to explain.

When you say some of the code environments, have you also tried using the 
listings package?  If that's not enough, you may need to define your own 
floating body environment.

Don,

We did something simular for "listings" -- chunks of
code etc.  The style file we produced lets you
add a caption to a listing (usually displayed in a "figure"),
and lets you produce a "list of listings " (like
a list of figures) in the prelims.

The style file is at:
   http://uit.co.uk/sites/localhost/files/uitlistings.sty

(This wasn't intended for public release, so you'll probably
have to tweak it, but it will give you a very good idea of what
you need to do.)

	Regards,
	Niall

Dear Sir:

I could sware that there was a time when I could preview my "extra wide"
TeX documents using a landscape option in YAP.
Now, though, I can find no such option.
I don't know what happened.

More generally, is it possible to use page sizes other than 8.5" by 11" in 
YAP?
I can tell you that such an option would sure be nice.

The cross-reference commands of Eplain currently don't support
cross-file references, so the only way to achieve this is with the
explicit cross-references (\hlstart), which is inconvenient.

Of course, you can define your own \refn macro.  You could use
consistent naming for the labels, say, they would all start with
"\jobname:".  \refn could then examine the label and if the prefix
does not start with "\jobname:", it would generate a cross-file link,
otherwise it would call Eplain's \refn.

HTH,
Oleg

\newcommand{\buffer}{} makes \buffer \long while \empty isn't, therefore 
\ifx\buffer\empty is \iffalse.
\newcommand*{\buffer}{} would have rendered \ifx\buffer\empty \iftrue, just 
like \def\buffer{}. See TeXbook p. 210: "same status with respect to long".

With xifthen -- see p. 4 of documentation

     http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/xifthen/xifthen.pdf

this could have been done without any TeX primitives:

     \ifthenelse{\isequivalentto{\buffer}{\empty}}
       {}
       {\begin{itemize} \buffer \end{itemize}}

You may object that \empty is Plain TeX, not LaTeX ...

     Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] problem with align environment
Message-ID: <200902180947.28859.gingrich@rmit.edu.au>

This one is a bit strange since the problem manifests
as an error in the *second* use of the environment
even though it looks like the real problem is in the
*first* use of the environment. It's no a showstopper
since pdflatex eventually sorts out something that
works after generating 8 error messages.

I've tried to include enough information -- and hopefully
not too much. The information abut setup and packages,
possibly even order of packages, seemed likely to be
significant.

I've tried plain LaTeX on the source and it barfs
all over the place, so AFAIK it needs to be pdflatex.

Also, note that I have inherited the code from someone
else. While looking at the following Boolean algebra
in the text, (which was originally done in \tt with
a stack of $...$ markers) I concluded that it would
look a lot better in a proper math environment.
Align looked like the best choice, but I could be
wrong in this conclusion.

Thanks for looking at this -- my current theory is
that my problem may have something to do with comments
in text that then go back into math mode in the align
section that runs from line 465-473, but I cannot see 
any obvious solution -- when I tried fiddling this,
the whole thing "blew up"

Thanks again,
-Don

couldn't you provide a shorter minimal example, and one that could just 
be copied and pasted into our own systems?

Anyway why is there a $ in the second align?

I haven't tried your code, but try removing that $ and please post a 
smaller minimal example.

Subject: [texhax] Default for the Axes Linewidth?
Message-ID: <5FEF5893-9658-49FE-9667-5987E84BD7E6@web.de>

Hallo together!

I have a simple question, but the internet is obviously stuck for an  
answer. I am seraching for the default value of the linewidth for co- 
ordinate axes in pstricks. For the ticksize the default is for  
example 0.5/pslinewidth. But what is about the width of the axes?

Thanks a lot!

Best regards from Germany

hi, don,

the error is a wayward $ in line 4 (= 485):

    \begin{align*}  % [482]
            Z &= \overline{(\overline{A}.\overline{B} + C)} + (B.C) \\
              &= (\overline{\overline{A}.\overline{B}}.\overline{C}) + B.C    \\

              &= A.\overline{C} + B \\
    \end{align*}  % [490 ]

i first checked how many { and } and they
matched.  no help there.  so i then commented
out all but the first and last lines, ran it
(no problem), then uncommented lines one by
one until i hit the line that caused the
problem.  once the search was cut down to
one line, much easier to find the culprit.

Subject: [texhax] how to use lettergothic?
Message-ID: <499C99F7.7050000@gmail.com>

Running 64-bit Kubuntu 8.10.

I installed the lettergothic font using the getnonfreefonts script. But
obviously using it is more complicated than I assumed.

I tried the obvious:
  \font\rm=lettergothic
  \rm

but when I tried to compile the .tex file (plain TeX), I got:

----

mktextfm: Running mf-nowin -progname=mf \mode:=ljfour; mag:=1; nonstopmode;

The .tex file compiles fine if I use Latin Modern.

So what else does one need to do after running getnonfreefonts?

Yay!

Thanks, that worked.  I was using TeXShop and it "looked" like it was  
"commenting out" from the % sign and after, so I assumed it wasn't  
liking it.

Thanks again :)

Subject: [texhax] TUG logo competition: invitation to participate
Message-ID: <200902200050.n1K0ow613984@f7.net>

The current TUG logo has been in use for many years, and it has been
drawn to the TUG Board's attention that the logo does not digitize well,
cannot easily be reproduced, and that the source for it can no longer be
located.

Bearing these disadvantages in mind, the Board has organised a
competition to design a new logo, and invites anyone interested to
participate.

Once all submissions have been received, the Board will examine each of
them critically, and if any appears significantly better than the
current logo, the Board will then select what is (in its opinion) the
best, and move a formal motion that this be adopted as the new TUG logo.

Full details of the competition may be found at :

    http://www.tug.org/logo/competition/ (suggested URL).

The final date for submissions is 30th April 2009.

Sincerely,
Philip Taylor, on behalf of the TUG Board

Subject: [texhax] Creating TeX Font Metrics (TFM) file from TrueType Fonts
	(TTF)
Message-ID: <dd258e120902200204i585c1c68l80db40e8650a58ca@mail.gmail.com>

I have managed to install some of the Microsoft core fonts in TeX
(texlive and MikTeX), namely Georgia (jgi) and Verdana (jvn). This
works well with pdfTeX, but when ordinary TeX and DVI files are used,
the wrong glyphs are used for non ASCII characets.

I guess this is a matter of using the ttf2tfm tools correctly, but
this is a quite complicated tool that requires knowledge about
typesetting and truetype fonts that I do not have.

Has someone succeeded in creating working TFM files for Microsoft TTF
files, with working ligatures and european latin characters?

Message-ID: <9E11DBA6-1E45-4703-AA2C-46DD3D846B0B@gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm writing a document using the book class along with some custom  
style definitions I'm forced to use.

I'd like to include epigraphs (quotations at the beginning of the  
chapters) in my document. The epigraph package is fine for this.  
However, I'd like to remove the line it creates between the quotation  
and the source. The style I'm using already puts a big line below the  
chapter title, so pages would look too baroque unless I remove it.

I've been looking at the documentation of the package but it seems not  
to have that option, or at least I can't figure it out ?I'm new to  
LaTeX?.

I'm open to other options, including a custom chunk of TeX/LaTeX to  
write the epigraphs.

I've also have had a look at other packages for the same purpose  
(quotchap) but they don't work well with XeTeX.

Any help would be very much appreciated.

Regards,

A.R.

 From the epigraph manual (pp. 3-4):

\usepackage{epigraph}
\setlength\epigraphrule{0pt}

It should mean the absolute value.

I tried the code chunk and it failed:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
f(x)=O(g(x))\mbox{ as }x\to a
  if and only if there exist positive numbers d and M such that
|f(x)| \le \; M |g(x)|\mbox{ for }|x - a| < \delta.
If g(x) is non-zero for values of x
\end{document}

which gave:

! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.3 f(x)=O(g(x))\mbox{ as }x\to
                                a
? 
! Emergency stop.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.3 f(x)=O(g(x))\mbox{ as }x\to
                                a
No pages of output.

It's useful to give complete functional examples!

Fill in the missing $ ...

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
$f(x)=O(g(x))\mbox{ as }x\to a$
  if and only if there exist positive numbers d and M such that
$|f(x)| \le \; M |g(x)|\mbox{ for }|x - a| < \delta$.
If $g(x)$ is non-zero for values of $x$
\end{document}

That typesets nicely.

Looks like a snip of a $\delta-\epsilon$ proof in calculus,
not that I recall how those work anymore!

Bottom line:  it is better to give complete but minimal working code
so that others can play with it.

As a non-mathematician, it looks more
to me as if it denotes the absolute
value (which cannot be negative).

Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP4072D30B25A3D2BC48E730B1B10@phx.gbl>

I am new at Latex and I have a problem to insert graphics in my Latex Document.

The problem is that I always get the "File not found" Latex Error message.

Here is my input file:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\begin{document}

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{My Plot}
\graphicspath{c:\Documents and Settings\Jean-Guy\My Documents\LaTex\EPS Files}
\end{center}
\caption{Plot of the function $\sin x$}
\label{sineplot}

I am using LaTex-DVI. My graph is an EPS file generated with Maple 11.

My output file shows the following:

Plot.eps  Plot.ps  Plot.eps.gz  Plot.ps.gz Plot.eps.Z

Figure 1: Plot of the function sin x

Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong. I have reseach various documents obtained  from searches on Internet , but so far I have been unable to find out why I am getting the LaTex Error: File 'My Plot' not found.

Thank you for your kind assisance

The directory slashes in the \graphicspath statement need to be *foward*
slashes (/).

Hi Jean-Guy,
first your minimal example is not complete - not very helpful.

I take my own pic-include.tex compiled with 'latex pic-include':

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
Documents\LaTex\EPS Files}

\begin{figure}[thb]
 \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=.2\textwidth]{plot}
 % plot.eps: 0x0 pixel, 600dpi, 0.00x0.00 cm, bb=152 480 372 735
 \end{center}
\caption{Plot of the function $\sin x$}
\label{sineplot}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[thb]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=.2\textwidth, bb=152 480 372 735]{%
   images/plot.eps} 
% plot.eps: 0x0 pixel, 600dpi, 0.00x0.00 cm, bb=152 480 372 735 
\end{center} 
\caption{Plot of the function $\sin x$  2} 
\label{sineplot2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[thb]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=.2\textwidth, bb=152 480 372 735]{%
   images/my plot.eps} 
% plot.eps: 0x0 pixel, 600dpi, 0.00x0.00 cm, bb=152 480 372 735
\end{center} \caption{Plot of the function $\sin x$ 3}
\label{sineplot2}
\end{figure}

\end{document}

The result is given in the pic-include.dvi, where you can see that tex
does not handle spaces in path or file name (third \includegraphics).

I'm on linux thus I can't check if tex will take a full qualified path 
starting with hd (c:\....). Best practise is to put all pictures
into a subfolder (e.g. images) below your tex input folder, then they
will be always found as shown above, even without given path (first
\includegraphics).

For further info have a look on (given in a command line): 
texdoc FAQ-graphicspath.html
texdoc FAQ-dvipsgraphics.html

Hope that helps.
Peter

I hate to suggest this might be wrong, but if it were

You're partially right Phil and I was a little too quick in answering.

The correct form for the \graphicspath statement is:

\graphicspath{{c:/dira/subdira}{c:/dirb/subdirb}} 

That is, each path must be separately enclosed in another pair of braces
(explained in the manual).

Moreover, and a litlle more obviously perhaps, the statement should come
*before* the \includegraphics command that calls a file on the path so
defined.

However, the forward slashes *are* necessary; the very next error message
would have been something like:

Runaway argument?
{{C:\TeX \pigrotexmf \images \}} \end {center} \caption {Plot of the \ETC.
! Paragraph ended before \graphicspath was complete.
<to be read again>
                   \par

Cheers, Phil

I am stuck on the Bibliography part of Beamer (Section 10.6 of the

as items, changing from the default [article]. In particular, I cannot 
get the \insertbiblabel command to be recognized.

The advanced Beamer example that is shown as the first of the Examples 
listed on  http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/ .
shows what I want to accomplish. The first bib item has a book beside 
it, the second one an article. It is stated there that
the source code for all these examples are in the examples directory of 
the Beamer package. However, I cannot find them
in my downloaded copy.

Where can the source code for these examples be found?

Excellent; thank you very much. How could I have figured that out for myself?

It looked like you used a filename from ~/texmf/fonts/tfm/urw/lettrgth as
the basis for the font name, but when I tried that with another of the
fonts provided by getnonfreefonts [Garamond], that didn't work right. I tried:
  \font\rm=ugmr8r
but all the text ran together with no spaces. So I obviously have deduced
incorrectly how to choose the font name. So could you please explain what
the correct algorithm is?

Oh... I see; I shouldn't have used
  \font\rm=ugmr8r

I should have used
  \font\rm=ugmr8t

(although I don't understand what the "r" and "t" signify; but I see that
one produces the correct result [i.e., with spaces between words], whereas
the other doesn't).

Life will be so much easier when TeX fonts are automagically handled like
fonts in the rest of the system. To me it's still black magic, even after
years of sporadic fighting with it. If it weren't for people like you, I'd
still be using Computer Modern for everything.

PS I see that luatex 0.28 is included with Kubuntu. Maybe I'll play with
that a bit, to get a flavour of what's coming. I don't see any version
numbers on the luatex site, though, so I don't know how recent 0.28 is.

They already are, with XeTeX.  Of course document portability is
pretty much a lost cause when using system fonts.

    PS I see that luatex 0.28 is included with Kubuntu. 

luatex 0.28 doesn't have any system font support.  Whatever XeTeX is in
your distribution should, though.

Yes, for me is still a mystery (for example, I seem to remember that I  
got in a test better results in TeX using the ``y'' ending tfm font  
names for Lucida ---e.g., hlcbt8y, instead of hlcbt8r or hlcbt8t).

But it was really easy to advise you to use `` \font\rm=ulgb8r '' for  
lettergothic; I don't have the font, but I downloaded ulg.zip from

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/nonfree/fonts/urw/lettergothic/

uncompressed it, looked at the ulg.map file and saw these lines

ulgb8r LetterGothic-Bol " TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont " <8r.enc  
<ulgb8a.pfb
ulgbi8r LetterGothic-BolIta " TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont " <8r.enc  
<ulgbi8a.pfb

So, as said, it was easy ---ulgb8r is the (only?) valid tfm name for  
the corresponding Postscript font (*.pfb).

Best,

Axel

First of all, let me explain the difference between a character and a
glyph.  A glyph is a visual representation of a character.  Visual
representations of the character "a" could be "{\bf a}" or "{\it a}".

They are encoded differently.  A Type1 font can contain an arbitrary
number of glyps.  In a Type1 font every glyph has a name.  Computer
programs assign a number to each character.  TeX can only use 256
characters at the same time, while most Type1 fonts contain more than
256 glyphs.  In order to make all glyphs available, you have to
provide several encoding vectors, each one supporting at most 265
glyphs.  An encoding vector is an array which contains exactly 265
glyph names.  Encoding vectors are human readable and have the
extension .enc.

For each encoding you need a separate .tfm file.  TeX is only
interested in .tfm files.  Post-processors like dvips or dvipdf* are
responsible for actual font inclusion, TeX only writes the name of the
tfm file into the dvi file.

For each subset of a particular font, there is a unique tfm file.  How
do post-processors know what to do?  Well, this information is in the
.map files, for instance "psfonts.map".

Everything is brilliantly explained in the dvips manual.

You might wonder why things can't be done automatically in the
background.  Unfortunately, not all fonts are compliant with current
standards (the Adobe Glyph List) and manual interaction is
unavoidable.

 >> Exception: unless you are using XeTeX or (one day) LuaTeX, in

TeX never prevented you to use reasonable names.  You can say

\font\rm=Palatino

if there is a file "Palatino.tfm".

The only purpose of Karl Berry's naming scheme is to support
old-fashioned operating systems.

You don't need XeTeX or LuaTeX if this is all you want.

Do all your sytem fonts work perfectly always?  Not everything can be
done automatically.

I don't want to use Computer Modern for everything.  I prefer Palatino
as a text font and Latin Modern Typewriter for program code.

However, it's easy to accomplish.  On Windows, just copy all fonts
from (TeX Live assumed) texmf-dist/fonts/opentype to C:\Windows\Fonts
and re-boot.

On Unix the procedure is quite similar, but you have to create the
fonts.dir and fonts.scale files.  But if a particular font is
supported by your Linux distro, it's sufficient to install it.

Then start firefox and edit File->Preferences->Content->Fonts&Colors.  

On both, the Unix machine at home and the Windows machine at work, the
default text font is Palatino and the default font for program code is
Latin Modern Teletype.  It's quite pleasant.

Regards,
  Reinhard

There is no problem to use a particular font in LaTeX.

If you insist on plain TeX, you have two choices:

  1.  Re-invent the wheel again.

  2.  Reverse engineer the LaTeX code.

Good Luck,

Feels like a dumb question, but I have searched around, and can't
figure out how to center an entire paragraph (or ideally several
paragraphs) of text.

LaTeX has the \center environment, but I'm restricted to plain TeX.
\centerline works for a single line, but I want TeX to do
line-breaking over an entire paragraph, and center the final text.
It seems like what I really want is to add a \hfil to both ends of
each line, but I haven't found the right incantation yet...

Anyone know how to do this?

I jumped the gun - just found it.
\leftskip, \rightskip, and \parfillskip do the job nicely

Just one clarification, particularly for those not old enough to know  
about it ---when Karl Berry proposed that scheme, those (now) old- 
fashioned operating systems were the OS most people used (like MS-DOS,  
with its `` 8.3 '' limit for naming).

I know ---LaTeX is what I have used for all the books I have prepared  
for publishing, as a copy-editor with a typographer heart and ``lead

metal type ---both movable and Linotype--- was made of lead alloys.)

I don't insist because I don't use it; but I don't use it not because  
I don't want to, but because I don't have enough knowledge to use it.

That wasn't well phrased ---I should have said ``...for all the TeX  
processed books...''. For many, many years I dwelt in the (for me) not- 
so-pleasant world of QuarkXpress and InDesign; but thanks to Richard  
Koch's TeXShop, Gerben Wierda's TeX distribution for the Mac, and the  
encouragement of Miguel de Icaza's friend Fernando Magari?os (La Mancha)

http://www.flickr.com/photos/migueldeicaza/951681999/

I took the plunge and started learning LaTeX. Obviously, I'm *still*  
learning LaTeX, and that has been thanks to the very nice people in  
this mailing list, as well as the TeX on Mac OS mailing list, the  
wonderful authors of TLC, Guide to LaTeX and Math into LaTeX, and the  
manuals of package writers.

My best regards and thanks to you all.

Axel

    The only purpose of Karl Berry's naming scheme is to support
    old-fashioned operating systems.

For the record, that was indeed the original and principal purpose.  But
it has turned out not to be the only purpose.  Some people like to have
font file names that follow a regular and defined scheme, as opposed to
the (essentially, sometimes completely) random names used by vendors.
And fontinst, as I understand it, will do some things for you if the
fontname naming scheme is followed.

Of course, I don't argue for it strenously myself (and never have,
despite it somehow being "my" naming scheme).  It's just a choice that's
out there.

(This has nothing to do with sinuhe's question, of course.)

FWIW here's the def from Texinfo:

  \parindent=0pt \rightskip0pt plus1em \leftskip0pt plus1em
  \spaceskip.3333em \xspaceskip.5em \parfillskip=0pt

	Good evening,
	I'm sending this email because I've been having some trouble in
installing add on packages to my LaTeX core. The packages I'm referring
to are the HA prosper package, the abstract package and the algorithm
package. I have the the archive files for these packages, but have been
unable to install them. I use Ubuntu Linux Hardy Heron, GNOME platform.
The front end program I use for LaTeX is KILE. I've already tried to ask
help from more experienced users, but I haven't been able to solve this
problem. I just don't seem to know where to install these packages. This
is probably my main problem. If anyone could help me with this problem I
would appreciate it.
Thank you for your time.

Hi all,

I'm trying to define a command that changes it's behavior depending on
whether the class file defines chapters or not.  Is there an easy way to
test for whether a macro is defined?  I'd like to do something like this:

\newcommand{\todo}[2][]
\stepcounter{TodoCounter}
\ifx <\chapter is defined>
\addcontentsline{tdo}{todo}{\textbf{\arabic{chapter}.\arabic{section}-\arabic{TodoCounter}:}
#2}
\else
\addcontentsline{tdo}{todo}{\textbf{\arabic{section}-\arabic{TodoCounter}:}
#2}
\fi
}

Can anyone let me know what the correct way to test for this is?  Thanks!

First, as a last resource ---LaTeX will always find any .sty file  
inside your working directory, that is, the directory of your LaTeX  
file (and will always use that first, even if it can find another  
version of said file in other directory). So, if nothing else works,  
this will.

Next, LaTeX will look into your ~/texmf directory; that is, a texmf  
directory at the root level of your Home directory. Put the *.sty  
files in ~/texmf/tex/latex/

Finally, the place preferred by many people:

/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/

If you use this last directory, you have to open your terminal and type

sudo texhash<return>

in order to update the TeX database, so LaTeX can find them.

Best,

Axel

If I understood you right, you do not know how to install the packages for 
Ubuntu right ?
Usually, there should be some finish packages available in Ubuntu.
Please use the System tools of Ubuntu to install them. I have no expierence 
with the GUI but under the console just fire up

sudo aptitude
Enter your Passwort
type "/" to search for a new ubuntu-package 
and then do some magic...
type in the search field
~dprosper
this means search within the description (~d) for the word prosper. The reason 
for doing so is the fact that many small LaTeX-packages are included in one 
single ubuntu package. You will likely not find a Ubuntu package with the same 
name as the LaTeX package you are looking for. Now you should find the first 
package which contains the word. Check if this is the package you want if yes 
hit "+" to install it if not please hit "n" to jump to the next entry.
Repeat this for all other packages your are interested and then hit 
"g" to see a list of all packages which will be installed and ones more "g" to 
agree and to start download and installation. After the installation process 
finish press "q" to exit aptitude (also this can be pressed always to jump back 
to the previous screen e.g. back from search to main screen, etc. ).

Thats it, the installation copied the files to the right folders and updated 
your TEXMF-path so that LaTeX and friends will find there new buddies.

If you like to install manual packages because there are not available in 
Ubuntu or there might be outdated, you can do that as well. However, this 
requires some play on the console. Basically you have to install the files into 
a folder and update TEXMF-path so that LaTeX  and friends know where to find 
the new files. Please ask again if you like to do that and I will try to help.

And that you don't post answers ("reply to all")!? ...

Besides an algorithm, you need an implementation -- that actually operates 
on strings. You need macros referring to strings und substrings. This has 
(almost) nothing to do with implementing "if" and "then" as ifthen does it.

Indeed, the first argument of \ifthenelse needs a *test* referring to 
certain things. The ifthen package implements tests of equality of strings, 
on oddness of numbers and of <, =, > of lenghts only (besides calculating 
boolean values).

The xifthen package adds tests for substrings, but it doesn't implement any 
*operations* on strings, i.e., generate a certain output string from some 
input strings.

There is a guide for class and package writers at

     http://www.ctan.org/macros/latex/doc/clsguide.pdf

and a section on the same matter in the LaTeX Companion. And finally CTAN 
is full of examples.

A student of mine who is starting out with LaTeX on Windows, is in need of 
a way to produce diagrams. (She writing a paper in 2-dimensional category 
theory, if that helps.)

Her operating system is Windows XP and she uses WinShell as a front
end.  She tried to follow directions for the diagrams package by Paul 
Taylor, which says to copy the macros on his website into her TeX macros 
directory, but she doesn't know where that would be, and I can't help her 
because I know absolutely nothing about Windows or how TeX is ported to 
it.

I'd be grateful for any help or direction!

Thank you,

why don't you use XY-PIC (the xy package) or TikZ instead, both are 
distributed with MikTeX.

If I remember right the diagrams package has some rather interesting 
license issues that most users of that package is not aware of.

Well, assuming she's using the MiKTeX distro (and if she isn't, she ought to
be and I can't help her otherwise,), then the manual explains this all
rather clearly; see section 6. Integrating Local Additions.

In short, she should create a directory called, say, c:\localtexmf.

After which she should open the MiKTeX Options wizard and, on the "Roots"
tab, add c:\localtexmf as a root.

She should then create a subdirectory, say,  c:\localtexmf\tex\latex\taylor
and place the package files there.

The final, mandatory, step is to refresh the filename database using the
button "Refresh FNDB" on the "General" tab of the wizard (this must be done
*every* time a change is made to the localtexmf structure).

BTW, this is a very, very, FAQ.

Cheers,  Phil

I recommend the xy-pic package, but your student might also be interested 
in looking at the diagxy package that you can find on my ftp site:
ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr/diagxy.zip
(it also appears unzipped as diagxy.tex and diaxydoc.tex) is a front end 
that makes it much easier to use (and also cleans up a couple of problems 
with the xymatrix package that nearly every use of xypic uses).

Incidentally, the requester seems to be under the impression that these 
packages are specific to windows or to linux; they are not.  The 
underlying tex engine has to be compiled for every OS, but the packages 
are simply text files that work on everything.  Both xypic and diagxy even 
work on plain tex as well as latex (which is not true of most packages).

It's not clear whether your student wants a procedural drawing
tool, or a WYSIWYG one; if she's very much a Windows person, it
may be that she will find WYSIWYG almost essential.

WYSIWYG
-------
Here we've used InkScape (also available on *nix) extensively
over the last few years, and it has served us very well indeed.
We do all our book covers with it, and use it for all network
diagrams in our computing books.  For examples see:
	http://uit.co.uk/altdns
and in the box on the top right click on 
	inkscape-diagram-examples.pdf
(Note that the fonts don't show up well on-screen,
for reasons that are irrelevant here; they print perfectly, which
is what we made them for.)

Other people use Dia or Scribus.  We haven't used them for anything serious.

Procedural
----------
The MetaPost language/tool is very powerful, tho' perhaps complex
for a new user.  However, it does let you produce multiple diagrams
that are consistent, and you can make global changes across a whole
set of diagrams (e.g. in a book).  For examples see:
	http://uit.co.uk/sustainable
and in the box on the top right click on 
	sample-metapost-diagrams.pdf

Niall

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20090226214327.02640200@pop3.web.de>

The German Wikipedia article on LuaTeX,

     http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuaTeX

has been suggested for deletion -- does anybody want to contribute to the 
discussion? (Click in the box on top of the article page).

Reason (or "reason") for suggestion: "irrelevant", since first stable 
version expected for 2010 only.

I consider the level of the discussion not very high, even the defending 
votes are bad.
(I am just trying a better one.)

Anyway, there is some general quarrel about deleting Wikipedia articles, 
some "movement" of "users" (editors) is organizing itself towards 
expressing annoyance about a trait of others which expresses itself as a 
tendency towards suggest articles for deletion all along. By contrast with 
the criterion or "reason" "too bad" (which allows rebirth with an improved 
try however), the criterion of "relevance" is delicate, since many articles 
in the Wikipedia are "relevant" only for experts on a certain field anyway.

Come on! Martin! ...!

     Uwe.

Message-ID: <d2e22f8e0902261404t5cb5f105rf1be57c4b551928c@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,

I can't seem to figure out how to include .eps file in a LaTex document. I
realize that this is a FAQ but I just can't seem to get it working. I am
running Ubuntu 8.10 and am making a conference poster using beamerposter
(which totally rules BTW)

Here is my preamble:

 \documentclass[final,hyperref={pdfpagelabels=false}]{beamer}

\mode<presentation>

{

% \usetheme{Berlin}

\usetheme{Dreuw}

}

\usepackage{times}

\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm, amssymb, latexsym}

\boldmath

\usepackage{tikz}

\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows}

%\usepackage{epstopdf}

\usepackage{graphicx}

\usepackage{natbib}

\usepackage[english]{babel}

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

\usepackage[orientation=landscape,size=a0,scale=1.4,debug]{beamerposter}


Now here is the portion of my document where I am trying to use the .eps
file:


\begin{column}{.08\paperwidth}

\vskip10cm

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale=2.3]{logo_green.eps}

\end{center}

\vskip1ex

\end{column}


Now I receive the following error in the log when I try to run LaTex on the
file. Any ideas?

! LaTeX Error: Unknown graphics extension: .eps

Sorry if this is super simple. I just can't seem to figure this out. Thanks
in advance.

Sam

You are probably using pdflatex, which can process PDF, JPEG, PNG  
files but not EPS. You must use an utility such as epstopdf to convert  
your EPS files to PDF.

Maybe they weren't worth it, I haven't used any of them myself. But if the

The main difficulty seemed to have been where to put the files:

and this may be system-dependant, indeed. There is no drive C: on UNIX. 
Working with WinShell, using MiKTeX would be natural indeed, already 
because the student can then find help online very easily:

Isn't Taylor available as a MiKTeX package? On CTAN it seems: not indeed. 
How come? Maybe the license is not clear.

Indeed, but once it was very difficult to answer, there seemed to be 
hundreds of different kinds of TeX directory structures. It seems to be 
much easier today:

     http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=wherefiles

"Use texlive or MiKTeX". However, quite recently PCTeX versions have been 
used which is able to recognize about 6 directories, so you made one folder 
TeXinput "for all the rest". Similar on a UNIX network at the university 
... once I made a TeXinput for packages that were not installed on the 
network ... it may be easy to use a localtexmf on such networks too 
nowadays ...

... and as Axel recently answered this question: if you put the .sty into 
the same directory as your .tex, you can at least be sure that it works for 
this .tex.

On Febuary 22, I forwarded a request for help regarding this problem, but so far I did not get an answer. 

Is this because I am not a member of the TUG? If I should join the user group would I optain this kind of support?

dear jean-guy,

    Hi, I am new to LaTex and although I have managed to use LaTex for short
    articles and reports, I have now experiencing problems to insert images
    (graphics) in LaTex documents.

    On Febuary 22, I forwarded a request for help regarding this problem, but
    so far I did not get an answer.

that's odd, since i've seen four responses to
your inquiry.

messages sent to support at tug.org automatically
get forwarded to the list texhax at tug.org, and
are answered through that list.  sometimes
responses aren't sent directly back to the
original sender, only to the list.  but for
three of the four responses mentioned above,
your address was cc'ed.  (if you really
didn't receive them, and they didn't end
up in your "spam bucket", please ask me off
list, and i'll forward them.)

    Is this because I am not a member of the TUG? If I should join the user
    group would I optain this kind of support?

it's not necessary to join tug (although we
always welcome new members), but it might
be worthwhile to sign up for the texhax list.
go to
  http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/texhax
and follow the instructions.

regarding your original question, my reaction
was that you need to specify \graphicspath
*before* \includegraphics (otherwise, how
will tex know where to look?).  also, the
presence of a space in the path name may
cause a problem.  the earlier replies had
other comments regarding the form of the
path name; since i don't use the same
system you do, i can't address those.

This is strange. 4 answers were posted on the list, and three of them were 
addressed explicitly to you (cc). The solution was that you must use 
forward slashes instead of backward ones in the path name. -- Uwe.

Hi Jean-Guy Murray,
the answers went to the list not to you privately, so have a look at
the list.

To be a member of TUG is not necessary, but to be a member of the list.

Hope this helps.

I have seen replies from Philip Ratcliffe, myself and
Peter Ragosch : I append further copies in case the originals
did not reach you.  As far as support is concerned,
TeXhax is open to all.  It is in your own interests to
join TUG, but it will make no difference to the level
of support that you get on this list.

That's strange, I saw several answers:

Support is open for anyone, being a member of TUG or not should make no
difference.

However, if you are not subscribed to the texhax mailing list you may
miss some replies. I'd recommend you subscribing the mailing list, or
checking the web archives. Information on both can be found at

Subject: [texhax] problems with circumflex
Message-ID: <49A8F27E.8000102@gmx.de>

Dear forum,

I wonder about the difference between $^x \operatorname{N}$ and 
$\operatorname{N}^x$. Here, I use \operatorname only to write it 
upright. Apart from that it doesn't play a role. The problem is that the 
space between ^x and N is larger than the space between N and ^x. 
Another problem is that ^x in front of N lies lower than ^x after N. I 
want that both ^x look exactly the same. If I use 
$^x{\operatorname{N}}$, then the space reduces a bit, but it is still to 
large. The space in $^x\!\operatorname{N}$ looks also better, but I 
think this is not the best solution.

Best wishes,
Benjamin

If you just want N upright, then why make it an operator? use \mathrm 
instead

The problem is not to write it upright. But you're right, 
$\operatorname{N}^x$ and $\mathrm{N}^x$ are different. In fact I want to 
use N as an mathematical operator. But even if you use $^xN$ and $N^x$, 
the spaces between ^x and N are different.

Hi Joseph,

Thank you very much for your answer. Your're right: I should have
started with a minimal example. I've tried the one you provided me and
works fine. But when I use the document class provided by my
department the error occurs again. That is, with the following
example:
   \documentclass{sereport}
   \usepackage{chi}
   \begin{document}
       Hello world
   \end{document}
i got the error I described in my previous mail.

So I guess the error mus appear when combining the two declarations.
But I'm still unable to determine the cause.

I also send attached the sereport document class.

Best regards,
Damian.

Subject: [texhax] Do not symlink when installing TeXLive 2008 on K/Ubuntu
	Intrepid	or Debian systems
Message-ID: <49A96298.50408@ee.uwa.edu.au>

Dear Folks,

I have just installed TeXLive 2008 from DVD on my Kubuntu Intrepid 
system. I thought that it would save me having to edit the .bashrc files 
if I chose the symlink option during installation, and did so.

This choice inadvertently led to problems later on when apt-get and dpkg 
would not install or remove packages successfully.

To cut a long story short, I discovered that TeXLive 2008 installs GNU 
install-info while Debian's package manager uses Debian install-info, 
and the two are not the same. Since the former is searched first after 
symlinking, it is used instead of the latter, and package installation 
or removal fails. See these bug reports for more info:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gv/+bug/316557

and

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gettext/+bug/301522

My workaround has been to remove all symlinks and to export the paths as 
suggested at

http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-310003.4.2

so:

PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/i386-linux:$PATH; export PATH
MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/man:$MANPATH; export MANPATH
INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf/doc/info:$INFOPATH; export  INFOPATH

In this way, it is only the user's paths that are altered, not root's, 
and the GNU/Debian conflict for install-info does not arise.

Finally, if tlmgr is later run as

sudo tlmgr -gui

for updating, it is necessary to specify the full path and invoke it as

sudo /usr/local/texlive/2008/bin/x86_64-linux/tlmgr -gui

or whatever is appropriate for your architecture.

I hope this helps to save others some time or grief.

Chandra

The TeXbook explains horizontal spacing in math formulas on, say, pp. 
154ff., 158f., 168ff. ...

[I think to have learnt:]

The circumflex attaches a superscript to something *previous*.

"left superscript" (as in non-standard analysis or ...!?) is not supported 
by TeX (from scratch, tried tricks, don't remember). "Symmetry" between 
left and right superscripts is not intended and occurs "by chance" if it does.

`^x \operatorname ...' yields a space because there is a space between an 
operator and something previous (to which the superscript is attributed).

With \mathrm{N}, there is the symmetry! ("by chance")

With $^xN$ and $N^x$ there is some symmetry again, but the "left 
superscript" is somewhat unable to account for the italics shift of the 
`N', while a "right superscript" does account for the italcs shift. There 
is no space between the "left supercript" and the *box* enclosing `N'. 
There is only some (apparent) space between the "left superscript" and the 
upper part of the `N'.

Before working at "superscript symmetry", one might reason whether it 
really is needed and worth it.

Thank you, Chandra; it certainly has curtailed the head scratching and
searching for answers.  Can you tell me what to do to remove the
symlinks?  And do I export paths in both .profile and .bashrc?

.profile is used when you log in, .bashrc is exectuted
if another bash shell is started. Usually both are run when
you login. Having paths redundantly added in both
will cause no harm. Having it only in .profile may
not work if you log in as someone else. Having it in
.bashrc would fail if you used a different shell.
So, simple answer, it doesn't hurt to use both, but
technically only one will suffice.
