Subject: [texhax] Tweaking BibLaTeX sorting
Message-ID: <4A4AA847.8050704@gmail.com>

I?ve got two books in my bibliography by the same author and published
in the same year: ?Modern Control Systems? and ?Advanced Modern Control
Systems?, and I?d like ?Modern? to come before ?Advanced Modern? in the
listing.

I tried the no-sorting option in BibLaTeX, but that gave me something like:

Thor, A.U. (1998b) Modern Control Systems etc. etc.
? (1998a) Advanced Modern Control Systems etc. etc.

Notice that the first reference listed is labeled ?1998b??not what I?m
looking for!

I found a bunch of sorting option in the BibLaTeX docs, but I couldn?t
figure this bit out.  I don?t want this to affect the sorting of
anything else in the list.

Thanks,
?Joel Salomon

Is there a veariant or relative of \citetitle that will list
	title = "Optimal Control Theory",
	subtitle = "An Introduction",
as /Optimal Control Theory: An Introduction/, or do I need to include
the subtitle in the title to do that?

I already know I?ll need to \renewcommand{\subtitlepunct}{: }.

Subject: [texhax] A question about \halign
Message-ID: <878wj8sndt.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi all.

In plain TeX, I have the following problem:

I have the following alignment:


\halign to \hsize{%
      \vtop{\parindent=0pt\hsize=105mm\hangindent 0em\strut#\hfill\strut}%
      \tabskip=0cm plus20cm minus20cm&\hfil#\tabskip=0pt\cr
      bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
      bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla &bnbnbnbnb\cr}


\bye


Now, I want that, when the first argument is very long and continues over a
second line, the second argument is put on the second line as well (in the
above example it is put on the first line, instead).

Please help about this matter.

Thanks in advance
Rodolfo

Thanks for reporting the issue, and for providing a nice minimal example
of the problem. I've uploaded a new version of the cleveref package to my
web site (www.dr-qubit.org/latex.php) which I believe fixes it. Let me
know if it works for you, and I'll update CTAN to the new version.

In general, I would recommend sending bug reports directly to the package
author in the first instance, without copying them to the texhax mailing
list. It useless noise for more or less everyone on the list other than
the package author him/herself. If the package author has gone AWOL and
you receive no response, there might then be an argument for asking the
mailing list about it. (I'm copying this to the list so that there's some
kind of closure in the list archives.)

All the best,

Toby

I still don't understand what ledmac internally does, but if you append additional footnotes behind \edt{...}{...} instead of putting them into the second argument, this could be the reason for problems with italics. The second argument is subject to \no at expands within a group, and \no at expands especially suppresses expansion of font switching commands. I think it would be worth trying the following: 

1. Put all footnote commands into the second argument of \edt=\edtext

2. In your document preamble, place 

    \renewcommand{\let\textit=0}

This extends \no at expands. If you get problems with \uline as well: 

    \renewcommand{\let\textit=0\let\uline=0}

and so on when new problems appear. Or \let\I=0 if you really never use \textit.

Then use \vbox, not \vtop.

Rodolfo,

Here's poor man's bold (from Knuth's TeXbook):

\def\pmb#1{\setbox0=\hbox{#1}
      \kern-.02em\copy0\kern-\wd0\kern.03em\copy0\kern-\wd0 
        \kern-.015em\raise.03em\box0}

It typsets its argument 3 times, each shifted slightly. Not ideal, but
it works when there's no real bold version of what you have.

Put the above \def in your .tex file (e.g., in your preamble) and then
use as, for example

\pmb{\beta}

HTH

Steve

PS I'll leave it to others to advise on how to install you own local
copy of AMSTeX, though if you use latex you should be able to simply put
the amstex.sty or amsbsy.sty files from the amslatex in the same folder
as your .tex file and latex will find it. Better would be to put it in a
folder pointed to by the TEXINPUTS environment variable. I would
suspect, though, that they are probably already in your latex
distribution and simply putting \usepackage{amstex} in your preamble
will enable your distribution to find it. To get more help, provide some
minimal details, e.g., platform, (la)tex distribution, etc., etc.)

As far as I know there is no way to have long tabulars (tabulars with
automatic 'page' breaks) in any form of multicolumn layout.

    I wish to try a feature of AMSTeX (in particular, I wish to try the poor
    man's bold font), but without actually installing it in my system yet.

steve schwartz has already answered with the
macro for \pmb .  the amstex definition is
based on knuth's.

    Can any AMSTeX user out there suggest how to perform a local installation
    of the AMSTeX files (in the home directory), just to get it a try?

if your tex installation is based on tex live,
then amstex is already on your system.  i'm
assuming that you really mean *ams-tex* and
not *ams-latex*.

structure your file like this:

  \input amstex
  \documentstyle{amsppt}

  \document
   ...
  \enddocument

you can get a brief manual for ams-tex via a
link at
  http://www.ams.org/tex/amstex.html
it shows only the basics though, not specific
commands like \pmb .

if you really meant ams-latex, \pmb is defined
in the amsbsy package, so
  \usepackage{amsbsy}
will make it available to you.

Sorry, mistyped, must be:

1. Put all footnote commands into the second argument of \edt=\edtext

2. In your document preamble, place

     \renewcommand{\morenoexpands}{\let\textit=0}

This extends \no at expands. If you get problems with \uline as well:

     \renewcommand{\morenoexpands}{\let\textit=0\let\uline=0}

and so on when new problems appear. Or \let\I=0 if you really never use 
\textit.

You may have put the \renewcommand line *above* \usepackage{ledmac}, I 
think so also because:

If so, you must reverse this order. More generally, you better *first* load 
packages and *then* define your own commands because packages sometimes 
define commands without \newcommand and then may redefine your commands 
without telling you, and then you may wonder what is wrong with your 
definition. We had such a case here due to nameref.sty which is so naughty 
to load \AtBeginDocument only and then may override private definitions 
from the preamble without telling.

I do not understand this entirely, but it makes me guess that you haven't 
removed my wrong line (you should do so).

It should be simple considering that dealing with font changes is a typical 
requirement here that has been met in ledmac and EDMAC form their birth on. 
The problem with my advice is that I had not installed ledmac and have no 
ready test file for it. I guessed from the documentation that the line 
\let\morenoexpands\relax is overridden later (there is some 
\newcommand{\morenoexpands}...). Now I have generated ledmac.sty and see 
that it is not, sorry.

So please try

     \usepackage{ledmac}
     ...
     \newcommand{\morenoexpands}{\let\textit=0}

i.e., remove the `r' and the `e'.

Good luck! (and best wishes to Vafa)

     Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Using .png, .jpg, .gif
Message-ID: <4A4C2CE0.1000509@eyremail.net>

Hi all.

I've been playing with the graphicx package trying to figure out how to 
easily use non-postscript images in a latex doc. I know that I could use 
pdflatex, but then I'd have the inverse problem. I want a universal 
solution.

 I'd like to get \DeclareGraphicsRule to work, but it seems more trouble 
to use than just converting each image file by hand.

For example, if I want to use a .png file:
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png, .eps}
\DeclareGraphicsRule{.png}{eps}{*}{`convert #1}      %% (the last arg 
I've done in many different ways, e.g. {`convert #1 eps:- } )

then, in the body:

\includegraphics[width=1in]{myimage}   %% (which is myimage.png)

I get an error msg telling me that I there is no bounding box. So in 
order to use it, I have to determine the bounding box for the image 
first, and then include that info into one or the other command.   But, 
if I just do:

 > convert myimage.png myimage.eps

on the command line, it converts it without having to know the bounding 
box info. I'm not sure why convert needs the bounding box info in one 
case (latex) but not the other (command line).

So, I'm not really getting the point of \DeclareGraphicsRule since using 
it is much more trouble than converting by hand. Which brings me back to 
my point, is there any easy way to use non-postscript images in a latex 
doc? My best guess at this point is no, and the only way forward is to 
re-write some of the graphicx commands to that they can use the bounding 
box info generated by 'convert' or some other conversion program.

TIA for any help or discussion.

Beverley Eyre

sorry, no, I can't. I know the problem and have tried a little, no success.

There is cuted.sty, http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cuted, an alternative package 
for changing between one- and twocolumn mode on a page. But I don't expect 
it fares better with lineno.sty.

I cannot deal with this soon, and I probably will need funding to improve 
this. Or is there somebody else who could do? Indeed I plan raising founds 
for such projects of mine.

Sorry,

     Uwe.

You supplied some sample latex code that seemed to be relying on the
size of your graphics to get things right. I'd be inclined to take
control, by putting tabulars inside tabulars, e.g., (totally untested}


\usepackage{array} 

\begin{tabular}{m{0.5\textwidth}m{0.5\textwidth}}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{long} &
	\begin{tabular}{m{0.45\textwidth}}
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{short1}\\
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{short2}\\
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{short3}\\
	\end{tabular}
\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{
	\begin{tabular}{.............} your table here \end{tabular}
}\\
\end{tabular}

Here's a bit of code I have tested which shows the idea in text and
without specifying column widths. Using m{} array specifiers or tabularx
or parboxes inside the tabular or just sizes from the includegraphic
will force things to be the size you want. The tabular will always
ensure things line up.

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\fbox{
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		\fbox{long} &
		\fbox{\begin{tabular}{c}
			\fbox{short1}\\
			\fbox{shortshort2}\\
			\fbox{short3}\\
		\end{tabular}
		}
	\\ % end 1st row of outer tabular
	\multicolumn{2}{c}{
		\fbox{\begin{tabular}{c} your table here \end{tabular}}
	}\\ % end 2nd row of outer tabular
	\end{tabular}
}

\end{document}

I don't know how you came to the conclusion that it's the \vskip-25pt
glue that changes, but I'm pretty sure that if you examine the output
of \showlists you'll see that the glue is -25pt everywhere.  What
probably changes is the glue before the \vtop, which displaces the
entire vbox depending on how much TeX has decided to stretch/shrink
vertical glue on that page.

Dear All,

Have a nice day.

I tried to use Multiple Languages in LaTeX. I have used Arialuni.ttf. I
could not able to use this font in MikteX 2.6.

How can we handle multiple languages in LaTeX.

Please help me regarding this,

\setcounter{chapter}{3} in the preamble, or before the \chapter command,
will have you start with chapter 4. (That's because the \chapter command
first increases the counter by 1, then uses it.)

Hope that helps,

I think what you need is \vadjust:

\def\beginsection#1 {%
  \vskip0pt plus.3\vsize\vskip0pt plus-.3\vsize
  \bigskip\bigskip\vskip\parskip
  \leftline{#1\vadjust{\vtop to 0pt
     \bgroup
     \strut
     \vskip 2\baselineskip
     \vss
     \egroup}}
}

Subject: [texhax] Examples of books written using LaTeX/TeX and related tools
Message-ID: <4A4E3D9D.3060507@uit.co.uk>

Folks occasionally ask about what sort of books can be produced using
(La)TeX.  We've recently published a couple of books using only LaTeX
and other free tools.  The first one is unusual because it's in 
full-colour and
contains hundreds of photographs and other illustrations.

1. "Sustainable Energy - without the hot air" is full colour
   throughout.  It was produced in LaTeX, and most of the diagrams
   were done in MetaPost.  Some of the maps and other technical
   illustrations used more specialized tools, such as the gmt software 
for maps.
   It was all free software.

   You can download the book free in its entirety, as a PDF (or even
   buy it as a normal hardcopy book :-).  There's a recent article about
   it on Slashdot, which gives the download link:
        
http://tech.slashdot.org/submission/1030811/Solving-the-Energy-Crisis-by-Tripling-Electricity

   If you don't want to look at the whole thing, some of the MetaPost 
diagrams are at:
        http://uit.co.uk/files-a/sample-metapost-diagrams.pdf


2. "Alternative DNS Servers" is completely different.  It's a typical
   computer book.  Again, this was done 100% in LaTeX, with diagrams
   drawn with InkScape, which is of course free.

   Sample diagrams are at:
        http://uit.co.uk/files-a/inkscape-diagram-examples.pdf
   and samples of tables of contents, etc. are in the box on page:
        http://uit.co.uk/altdns

Both books utilized Make to control the build process.  Unfortunately,
each author used his own build system, so there's nothing we can
release (although we're working on a standard directory-tree and Make
setup that we'll release in due course -- any volunteers for testing? :-)

    Regards,
    Niall

Thanks for your help.  Also without \vadjust, the problem seems to be solved
putting \vtop inside \leftline:

\def\beginsection#1 {%
  \vskip0pt plus.3\vsize\vskip0pt plus-.3\vsize
  \bigskip\bigskip\vskip\parskip
  \leftline{#1
     \vtop to 0pt
     \bgroup
     \strut
     \vskip 2\baselineskip
     \vss
     \egroup
}}

Yes, thanks for your help, that's fine.

But now, suppose that I want a third argument of the alignment to stay on the
first line, instead:


\halign to \hsize{%
      \quad\rm\ \ \ \ \llap{1.2}\ 
      \vbox{\parindent=0pt\hsize=105mm\hangindent 0em\strut#\hfill\strut}%

      bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
      bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla &bnbnbnbnb\cr}



\bye


I want that `\quad\rm\ \ \ \ \llap{1.2}\ ' stays on the first line and
`bnbnbnbn' on the second line.

Excuse that I'm asking too much!!

How can I achieve that?

Help very much appreciated: it's for the format of a table of content.

Thanks

Congratulations! I think it would be nice to have some of your  
MetaPost graphics in the TeX Showcase:

http://www.tug.org/texshowcase/

Also, UIT could appear in Tom Schneider's list of publishers that use  
TeX and/or LaTeX:

You should use \include to input each chapter, and use
\includeonly when you want to produce a single chapter.

If you know the width of something (like this) then you don't
need halign adjustment, but put this at the beginning of
the \vbox entry.

If all three absolutely *must* be in separate \halign columns,
then it is possible to set the second column first in \vbox,
then rebox it into \vtop, measuring the difference in height;
\lower the third entry by that difference.

This looks like a table of contents entry

A ha!  It is.  Table of contents macros usually don't use \halign
at all!  Just use paragraph settings with \rightskip \leftskip
and \parfillskip.  If you use dot leaders then that is the best
way to get the dots lined up.

You have to assign some maximum width for the section and page numbers,
but you have to do that anyway implicitly when you set \hsize for
the title text.

Subject: [texhax] LaTeX user interfaces
Message-ID: <19022.38819.336268.647996@zaphod.ms25.net>

Hi,
here is an excerpt fom a mail I received from the ctan-ann mailing
list: 
 
Announcement text: 
-------------------------------------------------------------
This version (0.8.9) introduces a new default way of loading
the package, using \usepackage{biblatex-chicago} instead of
\usepackage{biblatex}, an interface that should be simpler
for those who want the standard settings, and more flexible
for those who don't.  I've also added new entry types and
new package options, as well as fixing a number of bugs. 
Please see the docs for all the details of these and other
changes.
-------------------------------------------------------------

How many user interfaces do we need?  Should every package provide its
own user interface?

Why can't things be done conveniently?

   \usepackage[style=chicago]{biblatex}

instead of

   \usepackage{biblatex-chicago}

Isn't the LaTeX way much more elegant and straightforward?  Doesn't it
offer *much* more flexibility?

LaTeX provides an excellent user interface already, no need to bother
people with arbitrary new inventions.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks for alerting me.  I'd not looked closely at the original

Indeed. UIT seems to be a very new publishing house, and we should  
wish them the best of lucks.

On the other hand, they recommend MetaPost for non-GUI preparation of  
graphics, but I think that's the hardest system to master for a  
newbie, while TikZ is relatively easy to learn and very powerful, as  
we can see in Kjell Magne Fauske's  TikZ showcase:

http://www.texample.net/tikz/

And, of course, there is PSTricks.

Best,

Axel

Thanks for you help.  This seems to work fine for my purposes:

    \halign to \hsize{%
      \quad\ \ \ \ \ 
      \vbox{\parindent=0pt\hsize=105mm\hangindent 0em\strut%
            \rm\llap{1.2\ }#\hfill\strut}%
      \tabskip=0cm plus20cm minus20cm&\hfil#\tabskip=0pt\cr
      bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
      bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla &bnbnbnbnb\cr}

\bye



, even though it is not very orthodox for a table of content, as Donald says.
But it works and looks fine.  I've been writing by myself plain TeX macros for
sections and subsections and also for TOC, surely not without errors.

A substantial number of books in Classics has been done in TeX over the 
past fifteen years at the University of California Press.  Probably the 
most interesting production is the most recent, for which I have just 
supplied seventeen minor corrections for the second edition.  It 
required a huge amount of work with Adobe Illustrator to bring the 
illustrations up from the original rather crude 200 DPI tiff scans 
received from Italy to the requred 1200 DPI, and a substantial number 
were so defective that they had to be redrawn entirely. 

Otherwise the work was all in TeX.

Hi

I am using bibtex for bibliography.

I want to sort the references according to appearance number.

When I am using any bibliography style like amsplain  or anything else it is
not sorting the references.

I have used \bibliographystyle{unsrt} but I don't like it.

I want my bibliography style amsplain and also sort them according to
appearance.

How can I do so

Message-ID: <793e846d0907041537m3344ffa1w6dfecba0b40358e7@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to make a custom environment that will replicate the following code
without the \hline and the tabularx

\begin{tabularx}{|rX|}
  \hline
   stuff...
   last line \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}

Suppose the environment is called testbox.  Then the code above could be
written as:

\begin{testbox}
  stuff...
\end{testbox}

This is what I've come up with for the newenvironment code:
\newenvironment{testbox}[1][rX]{\tabularx{\columnwidth}{|#1|} \hline}{
\hline \endtabularx }

However, the \hline in the end declaration causes a "misplace noalign"
error.  If the \hline is removed the end definition, the code compiles with
no errors (except no bottom line).

Here is the smallest code that I can give that causes the error:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tabularx}

\newenvironment{testbox}[1][rX]{%
  \tabularx{\columnwidth}{|#1|} \hline}{ \hline \endtabularx }

\begin{document}
\begin{testbox}
  3 & c \\
  4 & c \\
\end{testbox}
\end{document}

Can you help me?

	hyphenation - setup for automatic processing
Message-ID: <dc2ad1cd0907060630g33f73e88jbd412c9c7f2fdc4b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to generate documentation from various XML sources
and create a PDF output using TeX (preferably ConTeXt, possibly LaTeX).
I need the system to run automatically, without user interaction.

By default, if TeX does not know how to hyphenate words and break lines
nicely, it leaves it to the user.

Could you please advise, how to tell TeX not to be so fussy
and rather work reliably -- no overfulls or other errors, even if the result
is not "perfect"? (the "manuscript" is generated, so I don't care
how complicated or unreadable it is)


1) Making larger gaps
How can I set it up, shall I redefine
\tolerance and \emergencystretch ? To what values? What is the scope of the
settings?
Is there any other important option?

2) Hyphenation
Is there any way how to fall-back to more aggressive hyphenation rules
if the default algorithm fails?
If the word is unbreakable, could TeX just tear off the extra letters it and
put them to the next line?
(I could theoretically put \discretionary to every word, but I'd prefer TeX
to use its own algorithms first)


3) Error reporting
Another issue is, that texexec
creates very ugly table (\bTABLE) with overlapping text in the cells,
but does not report any problem.
Is there any way how to make it fail loudly, so the problems can
be detected?



I'm using: ConTeXt
   TeXExec version 6.2.1
   pdfTeX 3.1415926-1.40.10-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.7)
   Linux i386 Centos-5

That is a remarkable claim.  In any case, what you need is proper 
settings of \lefthyphenmin, \righthyphenmin and \hyphenpenalty
It is easy enough to make TeX like hyphenation so much that it will 
hyphenate every word no matter how long the line is.
\watch what happens when you set a negative \hyphenpenalty.

Huge amounts of \hfuzz  \hfuzz=10pc
Do you really want to shut off all error reporting?  You can get much of 
that effect by running in nonstopmode.

Do you mean interword spacing?  That can be set by changing the 
\fontdimens of your font.  You can make the basic space as long as you 
want to, and you can also increase the added (or subtracted) values.  
\fontdimen2, \fontdimen3 and \fontdimen4 are the operative values

Not likely.  Pattern hyphenation either works or it doesn't.  If you are 
satisfied with ragged right margins, then the thing to do
is set \rightskip to something like 3pc minus 3pc, and that will usually 
cut down on hyphenation a great deal.

Not if you have shut off error reporting.  \vtop, with an explicit 
\hsize = <some dimen> inside the argument braces is a very effectife way 
of staying inside the alotted tab box.  Otherwise \tabe are very 
explicitly designed to overrun if you put too much there.

You do have a copy of the TeXbook?

Dear All

In my article i have some characters in Japanese charecters in my subtitle.
In XML file it will be unicode characters. How this can be handled in LaTeX.
I have used CJK.sty but it is not working. How to define these other
language characters in MikTeX. Which font i have to used. Could anyone help
me.


Eg:

title--NIR FT Raman study of phase transitions in ferroelectric pyridinium

periodate

subtitle--??NIR FT????????pyridinium periodate?

It won't work. The documentation says explicitly that \endtabularx
must be the first token in the end code.

That is not true, depending on what you mean by the "user".  Which 
human languages TeX knows how to hyphenate can be changed by configuration.
A TeX system will be pre-configured to hyphenate many languages (because
memory is cheap these days).  The "user" could re-configure it.

In LaTeX, declare \sloppy.  The opposite is -- you guessed it -- \fussy.

If you never see hyphenations then you have misconfigured TeX, or switched to
a language that TeX doesn't hyphenate, or set an infinite \hyphenpenalty, or
declared an invalid \hyphenchar, or some other mistake.

I don't see many Context afficionados on this list, but I understand
there is an active Context mailing list.

You need to define the new environment (see _The LaTeX Companion)

\newenvironment{defname}
%commands to happen at beginning of environment
{}%
%commands to happen at end of environment
{}%

If you need grouping which passes between beginning and end you'll  
have to use the appropriate command instead of brackets

Almost the entire set of the /Collected Works of Erasmus, /prepared by 
the Pontifical Instute of Mediaeval Studies and published by the

done in TeX.  I believe some of the first volumes may not have been, but 
TeX was adopted early on in the production.

The Korean TeX Users Group has done an extraordinarily effective job of
making CJK available in a number of fonts, and in a straightforward and
uncomplicated way. It does require sufficient disk space to store a
collection of 256 character fonts all identified with Unicode pages, but
by doing so it avoids depending on complicated and unreadable coding
schemes. Two years ago I adopted this for a journal article that was
half in Korean (both the earlier Chinese and the hangeul character set)
and it went so smoothly that the author was able to identify only one
typo in the final output. Pretty good for a compositor who still does
not know a single character of Korean.

See the package latex-hangul-ucs-4.0.7 (or later). I used the Un Batang
font.

Hi Niall,

For several years, I have had an Internet book project going where I use
LaTeX (mainly memoir style) to produce a textbook called
"Electromagnetic Field Theory".  You can download it for free from
www.plasma.uu.se/CED/Book and see how it looks.

The book will be printed later this year.

Best regards,

Very nice! Congratulations! Things look better than I expected for the  
TeX & friends world.

Just a question ---what did you use for your graphics? It seems to me  
that both PSTricks (which unfortunately I don't know) and pgf/TikZ  
(which I'm learning) can produce them easily, but I guess you used  
PSTricks, right?

Starting from online tutorials in 2005, "Designing Sound" became a
short free textbook of practical DSP examples in Pure Data (Pd) to use with
my students. It was originally entitled "Practical Synthetic Sound Design".

As well as writing and illustrating the book, plotting data and testing
the solutions I had to learn typesetting in LaTeX. This task was made 
possible by the kind, helpful members of this list to whom I am
grateful and have given acknowledgement.

All tools used are Free software, with extensive use made of Inkscape,
Xfig, Dia, Gnuplot and Octave. Pure Data itself is a free version of the
popular Max/MSP program. It is used in game development and mobile
audio synthesis systems such as RjDj for the APple iPhone.

The Pd diagrams export as Postscript, and can occupy a great range
of sizes. A challenge, and unique typesetting feature, of this book was
to use diagrams inline, as side paragraph pictures, and as stand alone
figures. This proved a difficult task, at one point I tried writing a 
parser to translate Pd netlists into PStricks code (unsuccessfully - and
went back to doing it the hard way aided by Perl scripts).

After selling hundreds of copies to customers around the world from my 
little publishing start-up Applied Scientific Press the book has now 
been signed to The MIT Press. Many of the kind reviews mention the
quality of typesetting/layout, which I believe to be an integral part 
of writing a technical textbook, inseparable from production of the text.

As all textbooks are a labor of love, this one took me 3 years, with no 
budget. LaTeX, Free software, and the support given to me, helped make it 
possible. Thankyou.

Hello:

I am using Windows, with MiKTex 2.6 and TeXnic Center 7.1 beta.  Been using it for years, no problem.

Always used *.png figure files with Latex.  Now I need to use encapsulated postscript.

I use the exact same figure formats (e.g., \usepackage{graphicx}, \usepackage{subfigure}) as with *.png files.

However, I get fatal error on these figures, as follows:
!  LaTex Error:  Unknonw graphics extension:  .eps.
See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.

Can someone please explain a solution?

Thanks much.

This is one of my least favorite things about LaTeX. If you're using pdftex
to compile, you can use (virtually) any image type (png, jpg, etc.) in your
documents, but NOT eps. If you use the latex command in concert with dvips
or dvi2pdf, you can use eps, but nothing else. I've never heard of anyone
offering a solution supporting both eps and jpg file types (someone please
prove me wrong!).

To answer your question, refer to sections 4.1 and 4.7.3 of the Not So Short
Introduction to LaTeX. You want
\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} and must compile using latex, rather than
pdftex.

HTH,
Bob Wilson

But you can use epstopdf to convert EPS files to PDF on the fly.

And if you want to output PDF, use

\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{epstopdf}
\epstopdfsetup{update,prepend}

See

Hi all.
I use my own font to write text but latex can not break my text into

what exactly are you doing right now? Usually, LaTeX has no problems
breaking lines. Could you post a very short example of what you are doing?
Then perhaps someone has a chance to find out what's going wrong.

OK, I get the same. But

is alright. `}{' before `\B' removed. As I guessed: *all* the footnote 
commands for one lemma (first argument of \edtext=\edt) must (or better 
should, for the safe way) be in the second argument of \edtext:

>\edt{<lemma>}{\A{<Anote>}\B{<Bnote>}}

I knew EDMAC better, where \text{<lemma>}<commands>/ was the model for 
ledmac's \edtext{<lemma>}{<commands>}.

My guess about \morenoexpands was wrong, sorry. It seems to deal with main 
text formatting only, not with formatting notes.

Happy TeXing,

     Uwe.

Message-ID: <9b4746990907100807r386f3267ne5007b65e6e710e7@mail.gmail.com>

I need to display source code (mostly C++, but a little matlab and
XML) for research papers and tutorials, but am having trouble getting
it to look as good as software books

Question 1) With lstlisting or verbatimtab, is there any way to
highlight lines of code?  I want to have a chunk of code and highlight
relevant lines somehow (ideally with a background color for it, etc.
but I am flexible).

Question 2) What are the lstset settings people use with lstlisting to
make C++ or others look 'nice'?

Question 3) I tried both 'lstlisting' and 'verbatimtab'.  Are there
any other ones I should be aware of?
Thanks for your help,
Jesse

My error comes from how I learned ledmac, and how I thought the brackets 
functioned. 

 I thought \edtext{lemma}{\A{<Anote>}}{\B{<Bnote}}, \B and \A needing to be 
entirely separated at all times by brackets.   And I found confusing the idea of 
keeping all the notes in the same argument.     

 But really, it's more like \edtext{lemma}{\A{}\B{}all the notes together...} as you 
describe.  

Vafa requested an entire short section of text - so far, your suggestion works 
here as well. Maybe he will know why \textit strains the formatting to the 
breaking point.  Or maybe he'll be able to enjoy his weekend a little sooner. :  ).

I'll test on all the other fatal errors to see what happens.  But so far, great!  

thank you!  Rebecca

The version in Ubuntu is not the latest, but it works pretty well unless
you need specific packages that have been udpated since then.

Subject: [texhax] white space problem
Message-ID: <200907120106.n6C16g4P001480@strawberry.ncifcrf.gov>

Folks:

I've often been puzzled when bibtex objects to having white space in
between references.  It turns out that this happens for some journal
styles and not for others.  In particular, it happens with Cell:

http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/ftp/cell.sty

I've tracked it down somewhat but need help identifying the exact
problem since I don't understand the code well.

For this latex file:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\newcommand{\theversion}{{version = 1.00 of cew.tex 2009 Jul 11 }}
\usepackage{celltest}
\begin{document}
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
\cite{Schneider1986, Schneider1988, Schneider1989}.
\bibliography{all}
\end{document}

with this test style file:

% version = 1.00 of celltest.sty
% white space problem comes from this code:
\def\@citex[#1]#2{\if at filesw\immediate\write\@auxout{\string\citation{#2}}\fi
  \def\@citea{}\@cite{\@for\@citeb:=#2\do
    {\@citea\def\@citea{; }\@ifundefined
       {b@\@citeb}{{\bf ?}\@warning
       {Citation `\@citeb' on page \thepage \space undefined}}%
{\csname b@\@citeb\endcsname}}}{#1}}

I get a paper.aux:

\relax 
\bibstyle{unsrt}
\citation{Schneider1986, Schneider1988, Schneider1989}
\bibdata{all}

and bibtex objects:

This is BibTeX, Version 0.99c (Web2C 7.5.5)
The top-level auxiliary file: paper.aux
The style file: unsrt.bst
White space in argument---line 3 of file paper.aux
 : \citation{Schneider1986,
 :                          Schneider1988, Schneider1989}
I'm skipping whatever remains of this command
Database file #1: all.bib
(There was 1 error message)

But if I make the style file empty (or don't call it with usepackage)
then the paper.aux is:

\relax 
\bibstyle{unsrt}
\citation{Schneider1986}
\citation{Schneider1988}
\citation{Schneider1989}
\bibdata{all}

and bibtex is happy:

This is BibTeX, Version 0.99c (Web2C 7.5.5)
The top-level auxiliary file: paper.aux
The style file: unsrt.bst
Database file #1: all.bib

So the question is how to get the semicolon between references in the
final output (which is Cell's style) without being forced to remove
spaces in the citations?  How do I fix the celltest.sty code?

(How the chunk of style code generates the commas and space in a
different format is mysterious to me since it's not explicitly in the
code.)

Thanks!

Message-ID: <9b4746990907120745o3d6245f3vd0fa87f1c60b1aa4@mail.gmail.com>

I need to display source code (mostly C++, but a little matlab and
XML) for research papers and tutorials, but am having trouble getting
it to look as good as software books

Question 1) With lstlisting or verbatimtab, is there any way to
highlight lines of code?  I want to have a chunk of code and highlight
relevant lines somehow (ideally with a background color for it, etc.
but I am flexible).

Question 2) What are the lstset settings people use with lstlisting to
make C++ or others look 'nice'?

Question 3) I tried both 'lstlisting' and 'verbatimtab'.  Are there
any other ones I should be aware of?
Thanks for your help,

Hi,

I'm trying to get a large font using:

\newcommand\largetitleline[1]{%
\textsf{\textsl{\fontsize{36}{42}\selectfont}}
#1}}

It doesn't seem to affect the leading (\baselineskip), so if there's a
line break, the lines touch each other.

I even tried to change \baselineskip and \baselinestretch directly,
with no results.


Thanks for any help,
Kathy

I read a lot of books with worse listing quality (e.g. verbatim style,
no highlighting). :)

Listings with color are possible, I don't know about background
highlighting for seperate lines, but foreground color should be possible.
Have a look at the color section of the manual on www.ctan.org.

>    Question 2) What are the lstset settings people use with lstlisting to

I'm not doing this for real publications, but i use:

\lstset{language=C++,
		basicstyle=\small,
		frame=single,
        breaklines=true,
        breakatwhitespace=true,
		numbers=left,
		numberstyle=\tiny,
		xleftmargin=5mm,
		tabsize=4
}

I don't say this settings are 'nice', but they are Ok for me :)
Maybe the listed options can serve as hints for the index :)

The lstlistings manual mentions many other.


Hope this was of any help :)

the baseline calculation doesn't take effect
until there's a \par (or blank line).  if you
add \par just after #1, that should do it.

nope, won't help.  this seems to jump out and
bite nearly everyone at some time or other.
just remember the \par .

Do you really prefer

     \begin{paragraph}
     ...
     \end{paragraph}

to

     \noindent ...

?

However, \parindent=0pt avoids paragraph indents forever. Good old 
parskip.sty increases \parskip so paragraph breaks are better visible.

The bad ones are broken, but regular latex used to choke
on such spaces a long time ago.

Are you in a position to fix it?  If not, then it is
best to bite the bullet and type no spaces.  Also,
suggest to the maintainer, if any, that the cite code
could be updated to a more recent version of latex.

Another suggestion...

\usepackage{cite}
\renewcommand\citepunct{;\penalty5000\ }
or
\renewcommand\citepunct{;~}


> This is BibTeX, Version 0.99c (Web2C 7.5.5)

And if bibtex were anything but apparent abandonware, it would have
been changed to ignore spaces after commas many years ago.

Seems that I'm the person.  But I don't know how to read the code
enough to make an appropriate change.  If you know how, I'd much
appreciate it.

You mean I should add this to the cell.sty?  Exactly what change
should I do?

Isn't it a key part of the LaTeX system???

Subject: [texhax] Using eurm10 font chart
Message-ID: <87my782yt0.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi to all (La)TeX users.

I need some greek letters that I see in the file amsndoc.dvi (p.38 for me),
under the eurm10 family.

I use plain TeX.

I put:

 \newfam\eurmfam
 \font\teneurm=eurm10
 \textfont\eurmfam=\teneurm
 \def\bb{\fam\eurmfam\teneurm}

, and it works if I do:

$$\bb A$$

; but, if I do:

$$\bb \varphi$$

, it does not work.  What is the best way to solve this?

Thanks for any help
Rodolfo

The only change I see from basic (old) LaTeX is the change of "," 
to ";" so one solution is to grab the current definition of cite
(\@citex specifically) from latex.ltx and put it in cell.sty (.cls?) 
but changing the "," to ";".

This might bother users of very old LaTeX versions by introducing
incompatabilities though.

I was thinking of in your document, after cell.sty, to over-write 
the definition with a functioning new one.  But yes, it would be 
quite sensible to replace the cite definition with loading another
package like "cite", which should relieve the burden of tracking
changes to LaTeX.  Use \RequirePackage or \RequirePackageWithOptions  
rather than \usepackage.  Check that the features meet the cell
requirements.

Yes, and it hasn't been maintained properly.

    I put:

     \font\teneurm=eurm10
     \textfont\eurmfam=\teneurm
     \def\bb{\fam\eurmfam\teneurm}

you shouldn't actually need the extra \teneurm
in \def\bb -- i suggest a definition modeled on
\def\eufm (p.11 of amsfndoc):

  \def\bb#1{{\fam\eurfam\relax#1}}

that way it should also be usable for other
sizes if you decide to extend your definitions
to include \scriptfont et al.

    , and it works if I do:

    $$\bb A$$

    ; but, if I do:

    $$\bb \varphi$$

    , it does not work.  What is the best way to solve this?

this is a function of how \varphi is defined.
in plain.tex it's

  \mathchardef\varphi="0127

which fixes the font as family 1 (cmr).  this
is essentially the case for any non-latin
symbol.  i suggest redefining \varphi thus:

  \def\varphi{\bb{\char"27}}

i realize that the eurm font isn't covered
very well (not at all?) in amsfndoc; that's
up for revision later this year, so i'll put
on the list a note to warn that the non-latin
items in eurm aren't accessible by the "usual"
commands.

Ok, I modernized cell.bst and cell.sty using cite.  Thanks for your

Hi, Barbara,

thanks for your help, but that does not work for me.  I had to define \varphi
as:

\mathchardef\varphi="B27

, where `B' is \eurfam, my 11th family.

Bye
Rodolfo

Strange your suggestion didn't work, any idea why?  Does it for you?

Message-ID: <a5c3d8350907140323y2314fa38v1f347b6f603480ed@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Texhax,

I've posted this question elsewhere, but having discovered this list,
I hope that this would be an appropriate place to ask it.

Has anyone managed to get tex4ht to work with biblatex?  Matthias Damm
says he has done, but I haven't been able to successfully re-create
his setup yet.  I currently have the texlive pretesting files
installed, so I hope that I have the latest versions of everything,
and I've pasted minimal example files at the end of this email.  I've
also pasted the error messages that htlatex produces on my system.

I've used tex4ht / htlatex very successfully with other packages.
Does anyone have any suggestions for making it work with biblatex?

Best wishes,

Nicholas

It might be fine, but I'm not sure how long ago \@cite at ofmt was
introduced in \@citex.

And that's fine too!  Hmmm, I see now it is an author-year system (I
just looked it up) whereas cite.sty is mainly intended for numeric 
citations.  That isn't specifically a *problem* but you should probably 
select [nosort,nocompress] options (\RequirePackageWithOptions), though
using another package as the basis might be better.  It is clear
that \citepunct should be \renewcommand\citepunct{;\ } to allow
line breaks in the best place.

I had assumed cell.sty was a more complete template for a journal layout,
rather than just the cite format.  Even the bibliography definition is
commented out!  I guess it was taken over by the change to \@biblabel
(great!)

I looked at the author instructions for Cell, and they don't really say
much about the citation format, just a bit about the bibliography
(references) format (need 10 authors to use et al!).  Lots about copies 
of consent forms!

Oh!  Back to biblabel... what you have now will indent the bibliography,
so it is probably better to use:

\def\@biblabel#1{\hspace{-\labelsep}}

\RequirePackageWithOptions[nosort,nocompress]{cite}

crashed:

Subject: [texhax] combnat package: extra space in author-year textual
	citation
Message-ID: <20090715224330.7c06bc4e@christina-desktop>

I am preparing conference proceedings using the combine package, and
using the combnat package (which is the combine-compatible version of
natbib) for the bibliographic referencing. It is working really well on
the whole, but I have a small issue with an unwanted extra space being
inserted after the year when I use \citet.

So while \citep{foo1962} gives "(Foo and Bar, 1962)" as desired, \citet
gives "Foo and Bar (1962 )".

When running on an individual paper in the proceedings and therefore
using the natbib package, the extra space does not appear.  So \citet{foo1962}
gives "Foo and Bar (1962)" as desired.

I tried delving into the .sty files in the hope I could work out what
was going on, but rapidly got very confused :-(

I have put together a minimal example at
http://www.btinternet.com/~roads/min_example.tar.gz (2.8KB) including
all aux/bib files, logs, and the resultant dvi output.
Unfortunately by necessity the problem involves multiple files, so I
couldn't think of a way of including it clearly in this message itself
-- hope this is OK. LaTeXing each of individual_doc and whole_doc shows
the problem.

I can get round it for simple cases by defining another macro
which splices together \citeauthor and \citeyearpar, but I'm not sure
this will work when things get more complex (plus it's ugly!), so it
would be good to be able to correct the behaviour of \citet if possible.

Many thanks for any help you are able to give on this.

    Has anyone managed to get tex4ht to work with biblatex?  

I asked CVR from TUGIndia, who has volunteered to help carry tex4ht
forward.  He found the following workaround (we'll fix it in the next
full tex4ht release, whenever that turns out to be):

-----------
There were two macros not initialized which I have done in the  
preamble of the document (test.tex):

\let\blx at resetpuncthook\@empty
\let\blx at csq@ifkernmark\@empty

Have noted the problem in the current version of biblatex.4ht package  
also. I have attached a small archive which has the  
source document, output and relevant aux files too.

Please add the following lines before \begin{document}:

\let\blx at resetpuncthook\@empty
\let\blx at csq@ifkernmark\@empty

This seems to be a bug in the biblatex.4ht.

The attached archive, test.zip has your test file and output html's.

That does indeed seem to have fixed it (how did you track it down, out
of interest? Or was it just inspiration?).

What's the best way of submitting this fix to distributions like TeXLive?

Thank you 
Luca 
That is not a bug. It is the established behavior of dvips for decades. What is reported in the line in the PostScript file is not the name of the PostScript file, which would surely be redundant, but the source from which the PostScript file was made. That way, if you should rename the PostScript file, you would still have a traceback to its origin. Such a clue can sometimes be a real timesaver.

Please add the following in the preamble of your document:

This will do the trick.

I guess you want to have a list of exercises and their solutions, and you want to have a printout *without* solutions and one *with* the solutions. 

My versions.sty has been used for this. In the document preamble, you mark environments to be included or to be excluded. 

The UK TeX FAQ discusses many other packages for related tasks:

Hope it helps

I correct myself: what I want exactly is:

\item{bla} bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
\item{bla} bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
\item{bla} bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

Dear good people of Texhax,

I was referred to you by Uwe Lueck who suggested that you might be able 
to answer the following random question:

Do you have any idea how to typeset a hooked-e in LaTeX (I attach a 
sample)?

I can do this with font encoding T4, but this encoding causes all sorts of 
unforeseen problems. I was wondering if you know of a simpler way to do this.

Best,

Still not sure what you want, but maybe this:

    \centerline{\hskip\parindent centered text}

I can do this with font encoding T4, but this encoding causes all sorts of unforeseen problems. I was wondering if you know of a simpler way to do this. 

I have run into this problem where I tried to use the "ogonek" in a macro with several levels of grouping. The solution---if you have a font in which the character exists as a fully formed composite is, if you are already using a font in which the character exists, is to \def\ehook{\char<whatever>} and use {\ehook} (don't forget the braces) where you need it. (The simple definition will work inside many levels of braces, where complicat ed accentuation macros will not.) If your working font does not have the composite character, you will have to invoke one that does in the macro sugg est ed above.

I tried it at

Detexify2 - LaTeX symbol classifier
http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html

but it mostly gave me thetas or other symbols.

I've sent a note to the person who runs that page.

It is very close to ogonek accent.  

Try this example:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}
\k{e}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Yes, this is what I expect.  It is supposed to support math symbols
only, not glyphs from arbitrary languages.

It certainly doesn't make sense to support anything but math symbols.
Or do you think it should support Chinese too?

Well, I can see that it might be technically difficult, but otherwise
the ability to recognize all symbols would be more powerful.  I just
thought of it as a symbol.  The page doesn't say that certain symbols
are not listed.  Also, the classifier page listed above points to

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/

which does give alphabetic-like symbols, see page 13 where there are
hookb, hookd, hookg, hookh and a few others.

Thanks.  It seems that also something like

\item{bla} bla bla bla
$$x = y$$

does such a job.

Would have helped if the sample was still attached. I don't know LaTeX
well. I only know how to build web applications...
So how does a hooked-e look? I may remember by sight if it is in list
of supported symbols as I have seen quite a lot of crazy symbols
lately ;)

Package ogonek worked well for me, although the ogonek symbol it produces is
not as robust as the one produced with \k command in T1 or T4 encoding.

But it will have to do!

Many thanks for this.

Dear List,

I have a horrible feeling that this is something that might be an FAQ,
but I can't see an answer to it if so despite Googling.

I'm getting a couple of errors like

LaTeX Warning: Label `cbx at 4' multiply defined.

I assume from the cbx that this might have something to do with
biblatex, but does anyone have any thoughts on how best to track down
the error?

Best wishes,

Nicholas

if you are at the start of a project, then use the memoir class instead.

\aliaspagestyle{part}{empty}

fixes the first

the other is the default

 to append argument to default list label, instead of replacing it.
Message-ID: <4A65DB67.2000302@uit.co.uk>

I want to change the behavior of \item within a list, so that any \item 
argument is *appended* to the default list label ("ABC", say) instead of 
replacing it.

The following is what I would like.  Let's say my "foo" environment 
typesets a list with "ABC" instead of bullets.  Then:

  \begin{foo}
  \item the quick
  \item[BONGO] brown fox
  \item jumps
  \item[bar] over the dog
  \end{foo}

should produce:

  ABC the quick
  ABC BONGO broxw fox
  ABC jumps
  ABC bar over the dog

Can I do this?

    Thanks,
    Niall

There must be a reason Knuth decided to provide a primitive rather
than a macro, while he even didn't provide primitives for such basic
things like loops.

However, recently I had the great pleasure to meet Klaus Lagally, the
author of ArabTeX.  I'll never forget his words:

  "You can do everything in TeX.  TeX is a Turing machine, ...
  ... and it can be programmed as conveniently as a Turing machine."[1]

This obviously describes your problem very well.

    by Aarhus University, Denmark), this is what you are looking for:

\let\semihalign\halign !?

Admittedly, this is not really "macro programming". And \semihalign will 
behave differently if another macro calls \halign: \semihalign will not 
feel much being called.

The trouble is that packages to be included into updates should be
repackaged by TL team and if I understand correctly the repackaging
scheme of TL2009 differs from one of TL2008. I also understand that TL
team just has no resources to repackage twice. This is not automatic
process as many package authors have different ideas how package
submission should look like. So, tlmgr 2008 most likely will not
update any package. It does not render it useless as there are other
commands like list, show, ... but no updates.

If I understand correctly there is a good chance that TL2009 will
self-update to TL2010 but not this time

Only very few of my esteemed colleagues switched from teTeX3 to TL.
They explain that some ancient file will stop compiling. I have seen
few such files and one of the biggest mysteries in the Universe is why
these files ever compiled :)

Subject: [texhax] Beamer, WinEdt
Message-ID: <C690CB1B.AF25%dafshartous@med.miami.edu>

All,

I'm trying to create a presentation with beamer and MikTeX 2.7 with WinEdt
5.5 on XP.  

Previously, this worked with MikTeX 2.6 but now it doesn't work since I've
installed MikTeX 2.7. Looking at MikTeX options --> Roots, I see that I
still have C:\Program Files\MikTeX 2.6 set as the installation directory, so
perhaps this is causing the problem.  However, there is no option to remove
this when I click on it in the root list.

As my problems seem to have started after updating to MikTeX 2.7, I tried to
remove MikTeX 2.7 from the root list but this resulted in error "unexpected
condition" in MikTeX problem report.  I also made sure to refresh FNDB under
MikTeX options but no luck.

Any other diagnostics I should try to sort this out?  This must be something
simple since things were working find before.

Thanks!
David

Sorry for the needless post, it seems the source of the problem was that I

I guess this is the essential answer to the original posting. Answering it 
seems to need much guessing indeed. I guess the misconceptions of TeX's 
hyphenation are irrelevant, and if the original poster sees the result of 
\sloppy, he will be happy and no longer insist on his hyphenation 
suggestions. The only remaining question is that of \bTABLE, I am unable to 
comment it. Regarding \sloppy, a ConTeXt user may need the definition of 
\sloppy (I don't know whether ConTeXt has something similar):

     \def\sloppy{%
       \tolerance 9999%
       \emergencystretch 3em%
       \hfuzz .5\p@
       \vfuzz\hfuzz}

I think I have never seen an overful \hbox with \sloppy -- until I now tried

     mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

I wonder whether such cases are relevant.

The rest is mere theory.

This was criticized, but it is correct in that the user can force a 
hyphenation that TeX would not do by its hyphenation algorithm. The wording 
however, creates an impression that there were something like a TeX message 
`I am unable to hyphenate this nicely, please do it for me!' This idea 
resembles the idea below that if one kind of hyphenating fails, TeX might 
try another; special case here: ask the user for doing the hyphenation. The 
user may force a hyphenation that TeX will not perform, and indeed 
sometimes TeX does not hyhenate as wanted; it is just strange to say `TeX 
does not know how to ...' then. Indeed TeX may not know that certain 
hyphenations are wanted. Real life examples happen almost each paragraph in 
German with umlauts and OT1 encoding.

Indeed, the answer `\sloppy' seems to answer the previous sufficiently.

The idea here resembles the fact that TeX first tries linebreaking without 
hyphenation and leaves it this way depending on \pretolerance. But there is 
no built-in mechanism to try another linebreaking with different 
(hyphenation) settings if the first try was "too bad". This may perhaps be 
implemented, however, as a macro storing the code for a paragraph in order 
to typeset it under different settings and somehow choose among them then. 
But I would need some hours for this and won't try.

A "more aggressive" hyphenation could be implemented by defining another 
language and associate it with a hyphenation pattern list that allows all 
hyphenations of the first language, but adds some "arbitrary" hyphenations. 
Then you could switch to the second language for another try at 
linebreaking according to the idea above. But who will generate such a 
pattern list, and is it worth it? I am not inclined to try this and to 
improve my knowledge of the matter for it.

"More aggressive" hyphenation may as well include (varying Pierre MacKay's 
comment) \lefthyphenmin=1, \righthyphenmin=1 and \hyphenpenalty=0.

Use font expansion and protrusion (setupalign[hanging,hz]), reduce  
left/righthyphenmin (\setupalign[lesshyphenation])

\setupTABLE[align=right]

or

\setupTABLE[align={verytolerant,stretch}] % or  
align={verytolerant,stretch,hz,...}

The link indicates that the symbols are really new, years away from getting

Subject: [texhax] columns, tables, margins?
Message-ID: <289e001d0907271801s3fe17fbfw78c042d6d9539e4e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I've spent nearly the entire day looking for a solution to this problem in
vain. Not being a TeX expert, I pray someone here may help. I'm (seemingly
simply) looking for a way to create a table with two columns whose widths
will adjust according to even or odd page numbering. That is, I'm looking to
set "inner" and "outter" widths to a table rather than left or right.
tabular and multicol don't seem to do this. I've been spinning my wheels
trying to adjust margin widths while using marginpar, but to no avail (I
only need 2 columns). The nature of the document is that a great majority of
the text must exist within such tables (using identical column widths),
except I must also be able to enter text outside such tables assuming
normal page dimensions. If this makes sense, can someone please at least
point me in the right direction?  Any and all help appreciated! Thank you in
advance!
Edward

Donald Arseneau sketched the (informal) complexity of the \halign algorithm 
under subject `Alignments and Knuth's uncertainty principle ...' in January 
here, see archive. The algorithm was not entirely revealed. It can be 
derived from the code underlying \halign. I believe that a very small 
fragment of TeX is Turing-complete, excluding primitives for typsetting ... 
to define a macro "emulating" \halign in TeX minus \halign measuring, 
storing, comparing all the cell widths should suffice and work with \wd and 
more general calculating and storing facilities. I expect that dealing with 
\hfil and \hfill will be quite complex here. So I believe the answer to 
your question, Vafa, is `yes,' but it is not likely that I will ever tell 
such a macro emulating \halign.

Donald Arseneau then also wrote that \halign is quite primitive or not very 
smart as compared to table interpretation of modern browsers, so why not 
emulate by TeX macros such a modern table interpreter instead of \halign?

This reminds me of LuaTeX ...

not really hoping it helps -- Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] "vertical" text within tabular cell
Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.64.0907281223340.224@bryan-lepores-powerbook-g4-12.local>

i want a table to have the text of one of the columns with "vertical", or 
"rotated-by-90-degrees" text so that it is read from bottom to top of the 
table, e.g. along the table edge.  it is impossible to provide an 
appropriate plain-text email example, so please see the attached source 
code.

some webpages describe this:

[1] http://tinyurl.com/lc5ru6 (uses "sideways")
[2] http://tinyurl.com/nav4s5 (uses "multirow" plus "sideways")

in my hands, method [1] puts a space that is the width of the text in the 
table, "spreading" the table out in the important table content, but is 
closest to what i want.  method [2] puts carriage returns after each word 
and again "spreads" the table out, but only in column 1.  i clearly do not 
understand how each works.

so i am asking for any suggestions or insight, especially to eliminate the 
"spreading" from the "sideways" method.

I'm afraid I can't draw up a page, but I'll try to describe it more simply:

This is for a book where each page will have two columns, the inner columns
(holding the main content) being wider than the outter columns (holding
comments). There are some places where I need to stop using columns to span
text the length of the page.

If you can picture this, you would understand why tables with "left" and
"right" lengths won't work. The closest I've come is adjusting margins using
marginpar for the comments, but this does not allow for easily inserting
text the full length of the page.
Does this clear things up at all?

Thank you for your interest in helping,
Edward

I think it does for me. I've used the package textarea:

http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/ncctools/doc/textarea.pdf

If you use TeXLive, you already have it.

Perhaps parallel.sty or something like it will help?

This was just what I looked into in my first attempts at a bidi TeX, but DEK looked at it and decided that it broke too many other aspects of TeX. That was what inspired him to produce his own solution, which became TeX-Xet.

According to an earlier posting, wawan called glyphs by control sequences 
like \ha. This makes me guess that he didn't have any interword spaces (no 
hyphenation either), so there was no line break. In this situation 
interword spaces must be inserted using `\ '.

Subject: [texhax] \documentclass{letter} Greek characters
Message-ID: <4A721F52.3000805@tollyboy.demon.co.uk>

I have an odd problem with the documentclass{letter} when using Greek 
and English. Everything seems to work just fine except for the headings 
on the second page of the letter which are rendered in Greek characters 
even though they show as Latin characters on the 1st and 3rd pages.
This only happens if there is a linefeed between the English and Greek 
environments on the page following the error.

Attached are the tex, dvi and pdf showing this.

I haven't been able to find an answer on the web and don't know where to 
look.

I can work around this simple example by removing the linefeed but the 
original problem was caused I think by an \enumerate containing both 
English and Greek spilling over a page break. I no longer have this file 
to play with.

Any suggestions on what is happening and why?

Regards
Richard.

The greek is active at the moment the headers are built. Add english
to the definition of the header:

\pagestyle{headings}
\makeatletter
      \def\@oddhead{\selectlanguage{english}%
                    \slshape\headtoname{} \ignorespaces\toname
                    \hfil \@date
                    \hfil \pagename{} \thepage}
\makeatletter

Subject: [texhax] problem with bookmarks
Message-ID: <BEE7397936278E4DB6D7CC5B88A2FFA145025DB9AC@STEAMBOAT.ucdenver.pvt>

Hello

I am a new user of Latex and I have a simple question.

When I write an email in WinEdit, say "email at domain.com," and then I convert the file into a .dvi and subsequently into a .pdf file the email address in the .pdf file shows up with a bookmark i.e., when I put the mouse over it shows a yellow box saying mailto: email at domain.com and if I click on it, it opens my email program. Do you know how I can get rid of this? That is, I want the email email at domain.com to appear just a plain text, without any bookmark.

Thank you,

Subject: [texhax] Making URLs live
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0907311725430.13292@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

Is there something simpler than hyperref that will make URLs live?  I 
tried adding the hyperref package and got an error the first time it hit a 
\ref in my paper.  I tried RTFM, but it was formidable and I am not 
interested in the options, only in getting live links.  Is there anything 
simpler?

\usepackage{html}

and then

\htmladdnormallink
{http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/toms/delila/hgraph.html}
{http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/toms/delila/hgraph.html}}

works for me.

See the example at
