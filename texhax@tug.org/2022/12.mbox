Hi all.

After upgrading TeXlive in my Debian system, the simple folowing example:

\input color

hallo

\vfill\eject\end

processed with simply `tex test, produces the following error:

$ tex test
This is TeX, Version 3.141592653 (TeX Live 2022/Debian) (preloaded format=tex)

! Undefined control sequence.
l.548   \protected
                  \def\mathcolor{\begingroup\@ifnextchar[\mlx at mathcolora\mlx...

? 


Please help with this issue.

Thanks,

Rodolfo

having said that, graphics-pln does mostly avoid  \protected so you could
change line 548 from

 \protected\def\mathcolor

to

\csname protected\endcsname\def\mathcolor

I'll make a ctan update

You need to run
	etex test
since tex is DEK original TeX, without a lot of extensions that are
nowadays required by most packages. The "etex" binary contains the
etex extensions.

This is true, but perhaps not the best design that miniltx, since the last
release, uses \protected exactly once, just before color.tex carefully
tests if it is defined or not...

Blurg I'll look but perhaps my first "use etex" answer was best there isn't
any downside to using  etex here.

Thanks!  But at

I still see Version 1.3d 2022-01-06, and in README.md it says there aren't any
installation instructions.

Thank you.  From

 https://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphics-pln

I simply downloaded color.tex and minilitx.tex and put them in the same
directory as my file's and the problem seems to be fixed.

I hope and expect it'll be all right now for the next 200 years!  ;-)

Thanks indeed,

Rodolfo

Message-ID: <202212052310.2B5NAKpn022494@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers

This is the last month of 2022.  A difficult year for many of us.
December celebrations coincide with the season of charitable giving;
I hope you would not forget those who are now in the need of your
help---especially those without power, heat and water.

Among the most important news of the month for TUG is that the Board has
decided to have an in-person meeting in 2023---the first one since the
COVID pandemic started. The conference is scheduled for July 14 to July 16
(Fri-Sun), 2023, in Bonn, Germany. The preliminary information is at
https://tug.org/tug2023/. We plan to include streaming and virtual
options; the details will be published later. Many thanks to Gert
Fischer, who is making this possible.

2023 is an election year. The rules and dates have been announced by the
Election Committee and the notice and nomination form can be found at
https://tug.org/election/. If you want to serve the community, this
might be your opportunity.

In the last newsletter I mentioned the new release of LaTeX.  In
November, Patch Level 1 was published by the LaTeX3 project.

Two conferences took place in November: TeXConf 2022 (Japan) and
the DANTE meeting 2022.

In other news, History of Desktop Publishing by Frank Romano was
awarded Honourable Mention by the Jury of the 18th ILAB Breslauer
Prize for Bibliography.  This book was reviewed for TUGboat by our
late friend and TeXer Dave Walden, so it is a good occasion to reread
his article: https://tug.org/books/reviews/tb127reviews-romano.html

On a related front, just last month, Frank Romano had a conversation
with famous type designer Matthew Carter at the Museum of Printing. It's
available online (in three parts) at https://youtube.com/@museumofprinting.

Also, the MoP is looking for additional YouTube subscribers, so if
you're interested, please check them out -- lots of overlap between the
MoP and various TeX/typographical topics. Their home page:
https://museumofprinting.org/

New packages on CTAN in November:
- crossrefenum, smart typesetting of enumerated cross-references for
  various TeX formats;
- cvss, compute and display CVSS (vulnerability) base scores;
- euler-math, OpenType version of Hermann Zapf's Euler math font;
- hershey-mp, MetaPost support for the Hershey font file format;
- hwemoji, Unicode emoji support for pdfLaTeX with sequences;
- lgrmath, use LGR-encoded fonts in math mode;
- luacas, a computer algebra system for users of LuaLaTeX;
- songproj, generate Beamer slideshows with song lyrics;
- unimath-plain-xetex, OpenType math support in (plain) XeTeX.

Happy TeXing and best wishes for the holidays!

Boris Veytsman, TUG President

Subject: font will not display bold in lualatex
Message-ID: <Y49rgmLjnerRn79D@histomat.net>

I have a lualatex document, but am beginner with lualaTeX. In its 
preface I consruct a text block header, the first line of which 
should be bold:

  \usepackage{libertinus}[??
    Scale=1.5
    BoldFont?????????? = lmromandunh10-regular.otf,
 ? ?BoldFeatures?????? = {FakeBold=4}
  ]

  \newfontface\Dunhill{latinmodernromandunhill}
  \usepackage[absolute]{textpos} % to create a block I can position absolutely
  \setlength{\TPHorizModule}{10mm} % defines module
  \setlength{\TPVertModule}{\TPHorizModule}
  \textblockorigin{10mm}{10mm} % start everything near the top-left corner
  \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}

Then in body appears the header:

  \begin{textblock}{5}(7.5,0.5)
  \center{
    {\large \bfseries\Dunhill{Should be bold}}\\
    Normal text\\ 
  \end{textblock}

Everything is OK except the first line "Should be bold". It is not 
bold.

that is no valid code. Next time give complete examples and not only

I believe the name would be lmdunh*, matching the naming pattern of
other latin modern fonts.  But a CTAN search for lmdunh* doesn't
turn up any boldface version.  Computer Modern Dunhill exists only
as lightface upright, so I'm not too optimistic that bold would have
been added for latin modern.

Is that not the reason for the fake-bold parameter, Barbara ?

Probably.  Thanks, Phil.
So that leaves the font *name* as suspect.  lmdunh* does exist, so
perhaps shortening "latinmodernromandunhill" to "lmdunh" might
produce useful results.

erh, you defined it right there in \mydate but your not using it in the redefinition of \today.

So what actually is the problem with the example?

As Lars Madsen already pointed out, you need to use the \twodigits macro
within \today if you want the two digits form, for example by making use
of the \mydate macro you just defined:

\renewcommand*\today{\mydate}

I didn/t see in Lars' post this replacement for my original line 
\renewcommand*\today{\number\year.\number\month.\number\day} 

When I made this replacement the date display as I wanted. Thank you.

Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB6338CFB477E9CCBC3A165C03BE1F9@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>


I get pubmed search updates and sometimes there is a retraction
notice included. Updates like this can be a problem.
This paper was recently retracted, 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35815265/

in the past, I had run into cases where the default toobib
entry did not pickup a retraction in cases where Zotero
may but I could eventually find it- it looks like publisher
html gets updated before doi entries if those ever get updated.

This one however neither Zotero nor TooBib picked up.
The TooBib "-all" flag however did find a retraction keyword
in one entry. I'm not sure if Zotero has a mode like this
as they seem to have one handler for each domain or something
similar. Anyway, TooBib had to scrape the html in a very
liberal way to get the "Retracted" keyword. Someone like Zotero
may want to include this. For TooBib, when I am looking for
retractions for now I will just run the "-all" mode
and use a fancy grep :) It looks like the bibtex collection
contains binary and I need to use grep -a :)  
 

grep -i "etrac\|handler"  xxxx

I use my own tcsh script to convert PubMed entries into bibtex format.
It uses a Pascal program - ancient but reliable tools (like LaTeX!).

https://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/delila/medlinebib.html

So I ran it.  I got this entry:

@article{Zhang.Wang2022,
author = "H. Zhang
 and J. Xian
 and Y. Li
 and L. Xiao
 and L. Wang",
title = "{Effects of Tenofovir Combined with Recombinant Human
Interferon alpha-2b on Negative Conversion Rate, Liver Function,
Immune Status, and Drug Safety in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B:
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis}",
journal = "Evid Based Complement Alternat Med",
volume = "2022",
pages = "1889628",
pmid = "35815265",
pmcid = "PMC9262527",
note = "\url
{https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/1889628}",
comment = "2022/12/10 16:00:11 ",
year = "2022"}

While generating that it told me that the way to get the medline
format entry is:

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pubmed&id=35815265&rettype=medline&retmode=text

If you try this link, it should be a clean text page (attached).

My medlinebib program parses this since it is a reliable format.

In there I found:

PT  - Retracted Publication

So you can use that to identify retracted publications - no unreliable
html scraping needed!!

See below, but 
IIRC, my script does it in two requests with this being the fetch,

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?tool=biotechmarchywka&email=marchywka at hotmail.com&rettype=medline&retmode=text&retstart=0&retmax=1&db=pubmed&query_key=1&WebEnv=MCID_63951073a293d76eb91c7f17

Thanks. Actually this is what I should try first but I checked the 
file and wget could not find the server ?!?!?!?. I have noticed
several times lately that the pubmed links seem to be slow
and go to the fetchpage handlers instead of using eutils but I
don't usually check. WTH it would have DNS problems is beyond me-
in the past the PMCID was not found on very recent articles
so I assumed it may just be flakey at the NCBI. 

But, this last run worked and one design feature was to include
unused fields like "PT" as a comment and this what happened here,

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the clinical value of tenofovir combined with recombinant human interferon alpha-2b in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and to provide evidence-based medicine for its popularization and use. METHODS: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of tenofovir combined with recombinant human interferon alpha-2b in the online database of PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, China knowledge Network (CNKI), China VIP database, Wanfang database, and China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) were searched. The data included in this study were extracted by two independent researchers. After extracting the data of the study, the Cochrane manual 5.1.0 standard was used to evaluate the bias risk of all the literature included in this study. RevMan5.4 statistical software was used to analyze the collected data by meta. RESULTS: Entecavir combined with recombinant human interferon alpha-2b can inhibit the activity of HBV polymerase and improve the inflammatory response of the liver. Recombinant human interferon alpha-2b can regulate immune function by inducing T cell differentiation and maturation and enhancing the production of cytokines. The systematic evaluation showed that entecavir combined with recombinant human interferon alpha-2b had higher serum HBeAg negative conversion rate, higher drug safety compared with entecavir alone, and improved liver function and immune status. CONCLUSION: Tenofovir combined with recombinant human interferon alpha-2b has a high serum HBeAg negative rate and safety profile for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. The combination treatment can improve liver function and immune status in patients, but more studies with higher methodological quality and longer duration of intervention are needed for further validation.},

I modified the code to deal with the "PT" field however.
Now it includes it in the bibtex although the phst field should have
a date retract entry :) ,

I think this fixed it, adding the 8.8.8.8 by hand also  speeded up
one slow page that may be shadow banned by ISP lol.

They changed things recently for the eutils, but I have not noticed
any speed problem with NCBI for some years.

Message-ID: <Y5cgRZlrVUQw07yf@histomat.net>

I have no trouble witn Feynman diagrams in a LuaLaTeX document, but 
find it difficult to construct one in a LaTeX document. I construct a 
c.tex file with the sample from the fmf manual:

  \documentclass[12pt]{article}
  \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
  \usepackage{feynmp-auto}
  \begin{document}
    \begin{fmffile}
    \begin{fmfgraph*}(40,30) 
      \fmfpen{thick}
      \fmfleft{i1,i2} 
      \fmfright{o1,o2}
      \fmf{fermion}{i1,v1,o1} 
      \fmf{fermion}{i2,v2,o2}
      \fmf{photon,label=$q$}{v1,v2} 
      \fmfdot{v1,v2}
    \end{fmfgraph*}
    \end{fmfile}
  \end{document}

When I do $ pdflatex c.tex I get error:

  ...
  [Loading MPS to PDF converter (version 2006.09.02).] ) 
  (/usr/local/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/tex/latex/epstopdf-pkg/epstopdf-base.sty
  (/usr/local/texlive/2022/texmf-dist/tex/latex/latexconfig/epstopdf-sys.cfg))
  ! Argument of \begin  has an extra }.  

If from a command prompt before running pdflatex I do:

  $ fm \mode=localfile;' input c.tex

in the result c.log I get 

  ! Forbidden token found while scanning to the end of the statement.
  <inserted text>
                ;
  <to be read again>
                   end
  l.11 \end
         {fmfgraph*}
  A previous error seems to have propagated,
  causing me to read past where you wanted me to stop.
  I'll try to recover; but if the error is serious,
  you'd better type `E' or `X' now and fix your file.

Should this not be followed by the name of the <METAFONT-file>, as per 
page 8 of the manual ?

Yes, that struck me as a _possible_ reading of the manual. But then 
I've no idea how to generate the mf file. I tried this with a feynman 
source file named c.tex:

  $ mf '\mode=localfont;' input c.tex

and it returns:

  This is METAFONT, Version 2.71828182 (TeX Live 2022) (preloaded 
    base=mf) (c.tex
  >> documentclass432
  ! Isolated expression.

                   {
  l.1 \documentclass[12pt]{
                         article}
  ?

I was not sure what to enter at the ? prompt, so quit. All the 
pddflatex command did so far was to create a log file. In it is: 

  OK, entering batchmode...
  ! Extra tokens will be flushed.
  <to be read again>
                   {
  l.1 \documentclass[12pt]{
                         article}
  I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
  so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
  but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
  everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
  now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete. 

  (See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)
 
This means nothiing to me. I downloaded the book and chapter 27
did not have example, but was about errors.

Herbert, thanks, but not much luck. 

I now use a corrected Feynman tex file named feynman.tex:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{feynmp-auto}
\begin{document}
  \begin{fmffile}{test}
    \begin{fmfgraph*}(40,30)
      \fmfpen{thick}
      \fmfleft{i1,i2}
      \fmfright{o1,o2}
      \fmf{fermion}{i1,v1,o1}
      \fmf{fermion}{i2,v2,o2}
      \fmf{photon,label=$q$}{v1,v2}
      \fmfdot{v1,v2}
  \end{fmfgraph*}
  \end{fmffile}
\end{document}

When I run pdflatex on this file a "test.mp" file is generated. I saw 
nothing problematic in it but wonder about "LaTeX_unitlength:=1.0pt;".

A PDF file is also generated 

  Output written on feynman.pdf (1 page, 3805 bytes).

  3805 bytes I'm sure is too small. In any case the PDF file 
  lacks any Feynman diagram.

I meant that the complete line is nowadays superflous.

Sorry, what I meant was the bibtex lookup was slow because
the "fast" eutils lookup was failing and so it had to get the html
and scrape it. All TooBib does is invoke my "eutilsnew" script which
AFAICT has worked ok alone. No idea why it was failing enough
to notice in TooBib other than the DNS lookup ( I just added
8.8.8.8 to resolv.conf at a different ISP as I had a troublesome
web page fail to load here ).

I am not entirely convinced that pdfLaTeX (which is what you are 
apparently using, even though you invoke it as "LaTeX") should be using 
the DVIPS back-end ?

Maybe you need to tell one of the packages that you are loading that you 
are planning to compile using PdfLaTeX, not just LaTeX + DVIPS.? Nothing 
to do with TeXworks, of course, so more appropriate list cc'd.

But still a problem, which perhaps I can apprend to this thread. I 
believe my orginal problem was failure to have the mode switching 
required by the feynmp-auto package. Thanks to you it was corrected by 
running pdflatex twice.

I embed the working Feynman diagram into a LaTeX book. However, the 
diagram again does not display.

The preamble of the book already contained:

  \documentclass[12pt]{article}
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

  etc

To incorporate the Feynman diagram I added:

  \usepackage{feynmp-auto} 

The environment for the diagram is \begin{fmffile}{test} and so when I 
ran $ pdflatex --shell-escape twice on the LaTeX source for the book, 
a test.mp file is created. However the diagram does  not display. 

The log ends: 

  Output written on HistoMat.pdf (382 pages, 926326 bytes).
  PDF statistics:
  1991 PDF objects out of 2073 (max. 8388607)

did you include the mp file with \includegraphics?

I wonder whether it is the HistoMat.pdf that he should include rather

I have just installed texlive 2022, specifically mactex. Whenever I install a new version of texlive, I also have to update font mappings because I use some special (commercial) fonts. The 2-step procedure for this, which I long ago gleaned from latex help sites is the following. In a terminal run

  1.  sudo -H mktexlsr
  2.  sudo -H updmap-sys --force --enable Map=newfont.map,

where newfont stands for the name of my commercial font. This time around the updmap command failed with the complaint that the options were not recognized. Specifically, the response the updmap command as given is
Unknown option: force --enable Map
The man file for updmap tells me that the syntax is still good.
I assume that updmap is actually specific to the active tex distribution texlive 2022, but I switched my default tex distribution back to texlive 2021 and tried this again, and the same thing happened.
Any suggestions?

I found the reason why the Feynman diagran fails to show up in my 
document. When I compile the LaTeX file with C-c-c in Emacs, it 
converts the LateX command to pdflatex. 

The Feynman diagram does not show up because the fenymp-auto package 
requires runing the pdflatex --shell-escape twice. So I compile
my .tex source docuement from a terminal with the needed command and 
the diagram displays correctly.

That is of course possible, but I would suggest:
- putting the map files (and related font files) into
	TEXMFLOCAL
- add a updmap.cfg file in
	TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap.cfg
and with this setup, the font will be automatically be picked up by
updmap, since it reads *all* cfg files found.

> Unknown option: force --enable Map

That sounds like you called
	updmap-sys '--force --enable Map=newfont.map'
which would be passed as *one* long argument named
	force --enable Map
with value
	newfont.map

Can you please check the invocation?

Best

Thanks.   I prefer to continue doing it as I indicated.  I?ve been doing it that way for a decade at least, and it is the way recommended here: https://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html.  The fonts are installed in the texmf-local tree.

The command invocation was as indicated.  In fact, I just cut and paste from my notes which I use every year when I install the new texlive. But I agree with you that the command seems not to be parsed correctly, and the mystery I?d like to clear up is why.

updmap is actually a perl script, and it could conceivably have to do with apple having changed the perl implementation.  But I also tried to force the use of perl 5.18, and that didn?t make any difference.

Thanks again, Fred

I ask, because here in Japan where I live I often make the failure to
insert a Japanese space, and eg Emacs does display Japanese full width
spaces as half width, so they are hard to distinguish.

Another idea is your IFS? Do you have some strange setting for IFS env
variable?

The problem is **independent** of Perl! It is a problem of your shell.
The shell splits the input string into words (by $IFS) and passes those
words on as separate arguments to Perl.

What perl sees is *one* argument
	"--force --enable Map=newfont.map"
and process this one with the usual argument parser.

So if there is a problem, it needs to be searched in the shell.

Well, that was an excellent suggestion.   I typed in the command by hand and put extra spaces between each word, and then it was parsed correctly.    (It did NOT work when I put the command with extra spaces in a text file and then copied and pasted the line into the terminal ? I had to actually type the spaces in the terminal!)

I?m not sure what other implications this has, but the immediate problem was solved.

Many thanks, Fred

And here we go, there is the error
	--force --enable...
should be
	20 2d 2d 66 6f 72 63 65 20 2d 2d

But you have
	20 2d 2d 66 6f 72 63 65 c2 a0 2d 2d
So you have
	c2a0
instead of
	20

c2a0 is "Unicode non-breaking space" or something, so this is NOT a
proper space you have in your editor. Probably changed by the editor or
by something else.

Subject: another pubmed retraction, Zotero appears to miss this
Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB63381F3471A2F2BECEE0FF50BEEA9@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>


I got another retraction notice today, 


https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24587999/

After the conversation earlier ( with 8.8.8.8 still in resolv.conf no idea what ISP's have against NLM  lol),
TooBib did pickup pubmed and found the ignored "PT" field
with the retracted word. Interestingly, despite a big red RETRACTION
on the webpage, it did not appear in all keywords except from a
more open html scraping which would not normally be used.
The Zotero output is at the bottom but first TooBib found
17 candidates ( some largely redundant ) but only the pubmed
eutils result and the hacked scrape found the word,

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of Leishmania specific KMP-11 antigen through comparison of immune responses after presentation by DCs and M?s to T cells in Indian patients with VL. Patients with DCS and M?s were directed against a purified Leishmania donovani antigen (KMP-11) and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). The cytokines (IL-12, IL-10, and TGF-?) producing abilities of the DCs and M?s against these antigens were determined by flow cytometry. The transcription factor (NF-?B) and T-cell cytokine support (IFN-?, IL-10), which could be significant in effector immune function, were also determined. Severe hindrance in the immune protection due to Leishmania parasites, as revealed by decreased expression of IL-12 and upregulation of IL-10 and TGF-? expression in the M?s compared to DCs, occurred in VL patients. The production of IL-12 in response to L. donovani KMP-11 antigen was increased in DCs which was reduced in M?s of VL patients. In contrast, the presentation of KMP-11 antigen by DCs to T-lymphocytes in VL patients significantly increased the IFN-? produced by these immune cells, whereas the levels of IL-10 were significantly elevated after presentation of KMP-11 antigen by M?s. The VL patients were observed with severely dysfunctional M?s in terms of NF-?B activity that could be recovered only after stimulation of DCs with L. donovani KMP-11 antigen. Immunologically the better competitiveness of KMP-11 antigen through a dendritic cell delivery system may be used to revert T-cell anergy, and control strategy can be designed accordingly against kala-azar.},

I ran across this url,

http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/74/35.abstract

 and the Zotero web form returns a perfectly good result,

@article{doolittle_step-by-step_2009,

	doi = {10.1101/sqb.2009.74.001},
	abstract = {The availability of whole-genome sequences for a variety of vertebrates is making it possible to reconstruct the step-by-step evolution of complex phenomena such as blood coagulation, an event that in mammals involves the interplay of more than two dozen genetically encoded factors. Gene inventories for different organisms are revealing when during vertebrate evolution certain factors first made their appearance in or, on occasion, disappeared from some lineages. The whole-genome sequence databases of two protochordates and seven nonmammalian vertebrates were examined in search of {\textasciitilde}20 genes known to be associated with blood clotting in mammals. No genuine orthologs were found in the protochordate genomes (sea squirt and amphioxus). As for vertebrates, although the jawless fish have genes for generating the thrombin-catalyzed conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, they lack several clotting factors, including two thought to be essential for the activation of thrombin in mammals. Fish in general lack genes for the ?contact factor? proteases, the predecessor forms of which make their first appearance in tetrapods. The full complement of factors known to be operating in humans does not occur until pouched marsupials (opossum), at least one key factor still absent in egg-laying mammals such as platypus.},

However, in this case I wanted to contact the author and the original
philosophy of bibtex was to include as much stuff as possible-
generally no one cares if it is cluttered. It turned out the
author email address was available but I'm not sure
if Zotero does hunting and gathering as much as just
taking stuff someone thought was important. This makes possible
cleaner bibtex but so what? TooBib did find the email
when it was availble and note too that even thinks
is issn may differ between print and e  
with inconsistent presentation,

I'm not sure if the full Zotero includes hunting and gathering
but it may be useful. I have a code to read and maybe
merge entries dealing with duplicate keys but have
not tried to integrate it to TooBib yet. 

I did notice the Zotero web form finally did handle
one pdf file- not sure if they got headless chrome to
work with pdf now :) Still, my "chromate" may make a useful
download utility although I want to replace wscat with
a websocket library :)

fwiw.

The editors of the journal to which I am submitting a manuscript want
the revised version with the changes visible in the compiled PDF file,
a la M$ Word.  This is the first I've encountered this sort of
request. I have my LaTeX source file under version control with git,
but that doesn't seem to be what they want.

I found this package on CTAN

https://ctan.mirrors.hoobly.com/macros/latex/contrib/changes/changes.english.pdf

but have no experience with it.

Any advice?

Thanks.

If you have both the original PDF and the revised PDF, you can use Adobe 
Acrobat to indicate the changes in a third PDF which you can then send 
to your editor.

I have used the latexdiff package/software to do this [ https://ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff ]. It doesn't require you to insert any commands in your latex file. You simply run latexdiff on a command line giving as inputs the old.tex and new.tex files. It then outputs diff.tex which is a fully compilable latex document - building on your doc's header,  that shows the changes using colored text, cross-outs, etc. As long as the original tex files will latex properly, diff.tex should as well.

You need a working version of perl as it's a perl script. There are various alternative commands, such as latexdiff-so, which provide an internal diff function if you don't have a diff program installed, or it's not compatible, etc. That's what I've always used.

I assume since you have your source under version control that extracting an old.tex file that corresponds to your original manuscript version should be straightforward.

<SNIP>

Just thought I'd let you know that I *did* receive your missive
(which was very clearly expressed and looks like it could be very
useful) yesterday.  So apparently your message was indeed sent.

The fact that the message (also) ended up in your Drafts folder would
appear to be one those annoyingly inexplicable instances of the way
that computer gremlins mess people around! ??

cheers,

Subject: More accessible research on arXiv.org
In-Reply-To: <CALD=Yf96=uasHFG1Gt7AL40w9Ret=umQA-RN8qvRJoH0X+9Dtw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

The preprint service arXiv.org is a major hub for open science research
publications. Last week arXiv staff published a framework for making these
publications more accessible. They intend to provide "HTML alongside
existing PDF and TeX formats".

This arXiv.org framework document, which includes the underlying desk and
field research, is available in both HTML and PDF. Please take a look.
HTML: https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_research_report.html
PDF: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07286

They wrote "incorporating the conversion [to HTML] into arXiv?s submission
process will mean substantial changes to the pipeline behind the scenes".
I'm sure we all wish them well with the major endeavour, and will where
possible offer them our help and encouragement.

On Thursday 19 January, 6:30 to 8:30pm UK (ie GMT) time there'll be a
special TeX Hour on STEM access, and in particular the document toolchain /
pipeline. We are fortunate to have Jason White, Jonathan Godfrey and
Patrick Smyth as speakers. All have expert knowledge and experience both
personal and professional. If interested, please do come to listen. They'll
also be an opportunity for discussion.
https://texhour.github.io/2023/01/19/stem-access-author-reader/

wishing you all seasons greetings and best wishes for the new year

Jonathan

Subject: latex math code generation ( and parsing )
Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB63382DFE9A4B82936DB4E139BEEC9@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>

ok, so I set out to duplicate mathmatica :)
Actually, make a simple algebra aid and give my
scattered math code a "front end." 
The first part seems pretty easy- in fact, the hardest
part was giving up an old rationals class I had made
for fixed size 32 or 64 bit ints. After spending days
debugging bizarre math errors, I just wrote a simple
one,  as the compiler complained, 
predicated on indefinite length ints ( GMP )
and it seems to have fixed the problems. Everything that
is evaluated is indefinite length rationals.  
It does some basic manipulations and I gave
it some trig sub rules ( trig to exponential )
and the basic approach seems to work. However,
the latex code genertion needs to be addressed.
You can see the "mikemath" output below but 
what I was going to try to do was generate code
like the following where an expression component
like an integral is expressed in terms of commands
named for its parameters like a,b,x,dx etc. 
The skeleton is fixed for all integrals but the 
parameter commands vary. 
This works great when I can limit the scope with "{}"
but this does not nest. Is there a simple latex 
command I should use for parameter  generation?
Ideally it is human readable for debugging and
editing and ideally it would be parsable for input
back into mikemath lol. If I do this right I should
be able to make all the specs in simple text files making
it easy to extend. 

Thanks. 

See this scheme for example where the "int" line if
fixed but each integral instance has differnt command
defs but this does not nest.

\begin{equation}
{
\newcommand{\cmda}{x_0}
\newcommand{\cmdb}{x_f}
\newcommand{\cmdx}{\frac{1}{x^2}}
\newcommand{\cmddx}{dx}
\int_{\cmda}^{\cmdb}{\cmdx}{\cmddx}
}
=
{
\newcommand{\cmda}{y_0}
\newcommand{\cmdb}{y_f}
\newcommand{\cmdx}{\frac{Sin(y)}{y}}
\newcommand{\cmddx}{dy}
\int_{\cmda}^{\cmdb}{\cmdx}{\cmddx}
}
={
\newcommand{\cmda}{y_0}
\newcommand{\cmdb}{y_f}
\newcommand{\cmdx}{
{
\newcommand{\cmdcmda}{x_0}
\newcommand{\cmdcmdb}{x_f}
\newcommand{\cmdcmdx}{\frac{1}{x^2}}
\newcommand{\cmdcmddx}{dx}
\int_{\cmdcmda}^{\cmdcmdb}{\cmdcmdx}{\cmdcmddx}
}
}
\newcommand{\cmddx}{dy}
\int_{\cmda}^{\cmdb}{\cmdx}{\cmddx}
}
\end{equation}


Mike math output with a simple trig expression,
two rules to convert to exp and then some rearrangements,
I have to figure out how to deal with non-commutes/associates
and am seeing what I can do with matricies,

If you are curious , the input is kind of odd  RPN lol. Each node 
has a list of child names and optional values. I can
do this in my head for now but it should work with many
parsers...
