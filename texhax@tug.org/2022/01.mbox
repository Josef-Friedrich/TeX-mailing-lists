Dear TeXers,

It is difficult to believe, but we now are already living in the year
2022.  It is now becoming a tradition to celebrate with a new
production of the Tikzducks team.  Here is the link to their 2021
extravaganza: https://vimeo.com/660399886

Happy post-holiday days to everybody in the community - and happy and
safe New Year!

Since the letter omicron is in the news, this issue of Numerophile
might be relevant:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXtfKMH6X44.  It
reveals an unexpected connection between omicron and the digit zero
(and the number 70, by the way).  About five minutes into the movie DEK
explains the big omicron, big omega and big theta notations.

This is the time to renew your membership:
  https://tug.org/join/
Thanks for supporting TUG!  If you are just starting your TeX and TUG
journey, take a look at our heavily discounted trial membership:
  https://tug.org/trial/

Some people asked whether TeX is vulnerable to the recently found
Log4j vulnerability.  The answer can be found here:
https://tug.org/texlive/cve-log4j.html.  In short, we are safe.

Upcoming conferences in 2022 include:
- Grapholinguistics in the 21st Century: France, June 8--10, 2022,
  submissions deadline Jan 10, https://grafematik2022.sciencesconf.org/
- The 16th ConTeXt meeting: Germany, Sept. 12--18, 2022,
  http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2022/

Submissions for the next issue of TUGboat are welcome.  Please 
send them before March 31, and early submissions are always appreciated:
  https://tug.org/TUGboat/

Due to the pandemic we did not have a regular Annual General Meeting
(AGM) for two years: it was cancelled in 2020 and conducted online under
ad hoc rules in 2021. The Board has now developed procedures for an
online AGM and also used this occasion to revise the rules for an
in-person one. The amended bylaws were adopted in December:
  https://tug.org/bylaws/

New CTAN packages in December:
- autopuncitems, automatically punctuate lists;
- bfh-ci, corporate design for Bern University of Applied Sciences;
- codebox, highlighted source code in a fancy box;
- kaytannollista-latexia, practical manual for LaTeX (Finnish);
- kinematikz, design kinematic chains and mechanisms;
- mathalphabets, introduction to mathematical alphabets;
- numerica-plus, iteration and recurrence relations: finding fixed
    points, zeros and extrema of functions;
- numerica-tables, create multi-column tables of mathematical functions;
- pst-hsb, curves with continuous colours;
- rbt-mathnotes, Rebecca Turner'ss personal macros and styles for
    typesetting mathematics notes;
- termsim, simulate Windows 10, Ubuntu, and Mac terminals;
- texlogsieve, filter and summarize LaTeX log files;
- unbtex, a class for theses at University of Brasilia (UnB);
- wrapfig2, wrap text around figures.

Happy TeXing,
Boris Veytsman (TUG President)

Subject: a use care for Zotero or TooBib, new literature and social media posts
Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB55716FE5823AB81F1C9824DEBE4A9@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>



I posted a link that did not work with Zotero or TooBib
and some questioned the value of automation for citation
collection. I value this feedback as I will put it in the TooBib
documentation and if someone comes up with something better
that is great too. I'm trying to "sell" some ideas 
based on appeal some bodies of literture- some of it designed
to be cited as with academic works other less formal
like social media posts. Probably many works can benefit
with citations to CNN or Fox etc. There are many possibilities.
Often, people just "cite" url's which may go dead or not
be worth clicking if some basic biblio info is there. 
See the release notes here, I'd like to just put an author
and title in the box to credit the two posts, 

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357538275_Missing_the_B0AT1_Amino_Acid_Malnutrition_in_Aging_and_SARS-CoV2

If you make it to Appendix E, this was put together in maybe
a day. It is just a collection of self-cites and few additional
works ( new to me ) that helped make a case. I only had to 
skim them to find the important points. Hunting around for good
bibtex would have been a huge distraction- google scholar is
almost never good as-is and sometimes multiple sources
must be examined. A DOI scraper however can do most of the work.
It saves a lot of effort for me to copy the url and 
use the same command line code to go get all reasonable
bibtex entries and take the first or edit them.

FWIW, if everyone contacted sites that don't like robots
that would eventually stop as usually it just takes
a day or two but they come up pretty often. AFAICT, 
at least one site is looking at SSL negotation
as I noticed Chrome uses QUIC which AFAICT is not supported
yet on wget etc. Beyond that, headless needs a small tweak
and it looks like you can do that without puppeteer
( the json based debugging port is cool once you 
get to know it and hopefully this is a "final solution" for
the problem ).
The other thing is Zotero can end up on a logon screen.
Headless chrome can use your cookies allowing easier
access to whatever private literature you have.
This does of course create a security problem for 
code others may download :)  You can argue about
the point of citing private literature although in
some cases it makes sense. 

Thoughts?

fwiw.

Dear Carlos,

As much as we all would like to help you, I am afraid to say -- this is the
wrong mailing list for such request. I do believe it will be an
excellent addition to TeXworks, and I do believe that several people here
are interested and work on the development for TeXworks, but this is not
the objective of this mailing list.

The place where all the discussions on development occurs is:

        https://github.com/TeXworks/texworks/issues

and you can make feature requests right in there.

I also tried to locate where the TeXhacks mailing list is mentioned in the
TeXworks web-page and I was not able to find it. If you help me locate it,
I would try correcting the information.

Hi

Happy New Year. May you and those around you be safe and happy.

When a year ago I started the weekly TeX Hour video meetings, I had ideas
as to what would happen. I'm pleased to say that I paid some attention to
what was going on around me, and that I was able to let go of many of my
previous ideas. Experience, someone said, is knowledge you get just after
you needed it!

Therefore, please don't give my predictions for 2022 priority over your
wishes and opinions. And share with me and others if you wish. We'll all
benefit from that. At least for a while, we'll continue to meet at 6:30pm
UK time on Zoom. All are welcome. Here's the details.

Meetings are Thursday 6:30 to 7:30pm UK(=GMT) time. UK time now:
https://time.is/UK.
The URL is:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Last year, I introduced a monthly cycle of B, A, C, D, E. These letters
stand for

1st Thursday: Beginners
2nd Thursday: Accessibility
3rd Thursday: Conversions (and new for 2022 - Community)
4th Thursday: Durable Documents
5th Thursday: Experiments and Exploration

The New Year is a time for review and taking stock. And for new beginnings.
I hope this month to discuss the B, A, C, D, E topics starting from
scratch. In other words, in a way that helps us see what is habit, what is
new, what is essential and what is custom. Although our planet has returned
to its starting point for its annual orbit of our sun, much has changed for
the human (and other) beings living on the surface of our planet since last
we were here.

The appendix contains a New Year's message I sent to the members of UK TUG
just after Christmas. The context is that 2 months ago the Committee
persuaded the members of UK TUG to vote in favor of dissolving UK TUG. I've
been a member for about 30 years, and this is a sad event.

Happy TeXing and wishing you a safe and happy 2022.

APPENDIX: Community + James Webb Space Telescope + Desmond Tutu

Two international events last week have increased my optimism regarding the
support and promotion of TeX. They also shine some light on the way
forward. The first is the successful launch into orbit of the James Webb
Space Telescope,. The second is the widespread recognition and appreciation
of the public service made by Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

The Webb Telescope shows that what Newton set into motion over 300 years
ago with his Principia Mathematica still has internal vigor, and public
recognition and funding. It is also a triumph for international cooperation
for a common human purpose and need, to understand what there is and what
is possible. About 50 years ago similar forces created the environment in
which Don Knuth's creation of TeX was possible.

Desmond Tutu used his position and skills to help bring down racist,
undemocratic and inhuman apartheid in South Africa. His route was
non-violent opposition, as pioneered by Mahatma Gandhi in the struggle for
Indian Independence and Martin Luther King in the Civil Rights Movement in
the USA. His relation to TeX requires some explanation.

In the 1990s Tutu was chair of the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, which did much to bring about peaceful reconciliation and
restorative (instead of punitive) justice to South Africa. The Commission
helped transform South Africa into a "rainbow nation". Tutu's work relied
on an African world view that there is a universal bond of sharing that
connects all humanity, or more concisely that "I am because we are". It is
humanity to others.

In many of the Bantu languages, this world view is called "ubuntu". It has
a close match to the ideals of sharing, community and collaboration that
are central to open source software. Also in the 1990s Mark Shuttleworth in
South Africa developed both open source and proprietary software. In the
2000s he used proceeds from the latter to fund development of a Linux
distribution that was, at his request, called Ubuntu. Nelson Mandela
defined "ubuntu" on video as part of the launch of Ubuntu Linux.

Conditions exist for science and humanity to develop and grow in 2022. And
this includes the continuation of Don Knuth's work in Digital Typography.

Hello,


I am working with plain TeX and would like to include a small photo jpg
file.    How can I do this?

Previously I have been using only eps files along with the \input epsf
command.


Many thanks in advance for any help.

Can't help with plain TeX /qua/TeX, Walt, but if you are willing to use 
plain XeTeX then \XeTeXpicfile is the primitive that you will require.

Subject: more on use case for citation managers: silverchair.com as an example
Message-ID: <DM6PR08MB557901854D7CDCF3570BD69FBE509@DM6PR08MB5579.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Previously, there was some discussion about the utility of
Zotero or TooBib. I found a common case with one particular 
domain- see the silverchair links and bibex at the end. 
I guess their solution is to click on the link
on the right of the page that is apparently inserted by the
server but this or similar solutions are not always
included in or on pdf files and it can be a pain finding
the citation. Note also that clicking here from 
google redirects to this bizarre temp url that
creates problems for later backtracking if you are just
recording url's during note taking. 

Zotero could not return results with the wierd url
nor the base url probably be design of the server
illogic. Toobib acting locally was able to 
get a good result and report the search strategy.
It looks like it can download the file, maybe
the url is just restricted to an IP address or
time who knows, scrape the watermarked publisher
url and come up with at least one valid entry.

Ideally publishers would not do this junk 
but its hard to play whack-a-mole contacting
each one although maybe toobib could include
automated emails where possible ( request
headers are already included to alert 
whoever looks at server logs :) ).  

Getting decent bibtex may also require multiple sources
and routinely several non-redundant sources can be found.

I have gotten headless chrome to work now, with
a c++ class called "chromate" ( not sure if name is taken)
to avoid puppeter although it uses node-js wscat
to talk to the excellent json based debug protocol.
Hopefully that will be a final solution, once integrated
into TooBib,  for
many problems but IP restricted URL's may still
be a problem for remote services. It can optionally
use my cookies reproducing sign in status
on the human browser. 

Documenting a source should not be a research project.
If people would just make simpler url's or put bibtex
in the pdf ( I will happily contribute my latex code
if I can clean it up ) this gets a lot easier.
And I still do not accomodate tug.org :)

abstract = {{Parameters of tryptophan (Trp) and related metabolism were compared in male Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) and -non-preferring (sNP) rats. Liver Trp pyrrolase activity was 38?58\\% higher in sP than in sNP rats, and this was associated with a greater expression of the enzyme mRNA as measured by multiprobe oligonucleotide solution hybridization. Moderately (about 10?19\\%), but significantly, lower concentrations of free serum, total serum, and brain Trp were also observed in sP compared with sNP rats. Concentrations of whole brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindol-3-yl-acetic acid (5-HIAA) were, however, 14?21\\% higher in sP rats. Serum corticosterone concentration was 18\\% higher in sP rats. We conclude that alcohol preference in Sardinian rats is associated with increased liver Trp pyrrolase activity and mRNA expression leading to a decrease in Trp availability to the brain. Although a simple serotonin deficiency could not be demonstrated in the whole brain, the possibility could not be ruled Out that a deficiency may be present in discrete areas of the brain of the sP rat.}},

*****************************************************************
Deadline Extension (January 20th) and Final Call for Papers
GRAPHOLINGUISTICS IN THE 21ST CENTURY?FROM GRAPHEMES TO KNOWLEDGE
Palaiseau, France, June 8-10, 2022
<https://grafematik2022.sciencesconf.org>
*****************************************************************
G21C (Grapholinguistics in the 21st Century, also called /g?afematik/)
is a biennial conference bringing together disciplines concerned with
grapholinguistics and more generally the study of writing systems and
their representation in written communication. The conference aims to
reflect on the current state of research in the area, and on the role
that writing and writing systems play in neighboring disciplines like
computer science and information technology, communication, typography,
psychology, and pedagogy. In particular it aims to study the effect of
the growing importance of Unicode with regard to the future of reading
and writing in human societies. Reflecting the richness of perspectives
on writing systems, G21C is actively interdisciplinary, and welcomes
proposals from researchers from the fields of computer science and
information technology, linguistics, communication, pedagogy,
psychology, history, and the social sciences.

G21C aims to create a space for the discussion of the range of
approaches to writing systems, and specifically to bridge approaches in
linguistics, informatics, and other fields. It will provide a forum for
explorations in terminology, methodology, and theoretical approaches
relating to the delineation of an emerging interdisciplinary area of
research that intersects with intense activity in practical
implementations of writing systems.

The Grapholinguistics in the 21st Century Conference is kindly endorsed
by ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) and by ATypI
(Association Typographique Internationale).

The first edition of G21C was held in Brest, France, on June 14-15, 2018
and the second edition was held online on June 17-19, 2020. It is
sponsorized by the LabSTICC CNRS laboratory (UMR 6285)

Hi

First, there's a really valuable and important accessibility thread for us
on the Blind Math mailing list. It's deeply rooted in real-world problems
and solutions. Mainly it's Jonathan Godfrey's response to Brandon Bigg's
query: Tutorial on Using RMarkdown?
http://nfbnet.org/pipermail/blindmath_nfbnet.org/2022-January/010146.html

In tomorrow's (Thursday) TeX Hour I'll share my initial thoughts on an
architecture for accessible typesetting. This will be a technical session,
focused on having control over what happens whenever input text is added to
TeX's horizontal list for the current paragraph. Last year a similar TeX
Hour conversation led to the concept of a Portable TeX Document, so
finger's crossed for tomorrow. All welcome.

Meetings are Thursday 6:30 to 7:30pm UK(=GMT) time. UK time now:
https://time.is/UK.
The URL is:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Next week I'm delighted that Nelson Beebe has kindly agreed to be a special
guest, as a expert and long-standing participant in the annual process that
produces a new TeX Live distribution each year. Nelson tells me that the
current status of his work and the final result for 2021 are logged at
 http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2022/
http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2021/

The TeX Hour continues to evolve. I hope at least once a month to have a
special guest to talk with us about an important topic. Nelson is the first
one this month (unless I immodestly count myself). I you'd like me to
invite someone, or volunteer yourself, just contact me.

 And we're enlarging the list of topics for the monthly cycle of B, A, C,
D, E. These letters now stand for

1st Thursday: Beginners (and new for 2022 - Basics)
2nd Thursday: Accessibility (and new for 2022 - Architecture)
3rd Thursday: Conversions (and new for 2022 - Community)
4th Thursday: Durable Documents
5th Thursday: Experiments and Exploration

Happy TeXing.

Subject: Print the codepoint of a unicode glyph represented by a latex command.
Message-ID: <CAGP6POLwWyngpsRNBmSM1sbX6KTwV5a6VB=kQxGPw7PN-01bJw@mail.gmail.com>

I find almost all symbols can be retrieved from "The Comprehensive
LATEX Symbol List":

http://tug.ctan.org/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf


But I want to obtain the codepoint, say, corresponding the LaTeX
symbols in the following document:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
\documentclass{paper}
\begin{document}
\textminus, \textnineoldstyle, \textohm, \textonehalf, \textoneoldstyle.
\end{document}
--8<---------------cut here---------------end------------->8---


Any hints for achieving this aim from within LaTeX itself?

( I doubt if Leslie Lamport knew about Unicode when he
originated LaTeX.   :-) )

Tex4ht, which runs using latex, will generate

     <p class="noindent" ><span 
        class="tcrm-1000">&#x2212;</span>, <span 
        class="tcrm-1000">&#xF739;</span>, <span 
        class="tcrm-1000">&#x2126;</span>, <span 
        class="tcrm-1000">&#x00BD;</span>, <span 
        class="tcrm-1000">&#xF731;</span>.</p>

(This, no doubt, required the authors of tex4ht to look up
these codepoints.)

Now, after looking at this in a browser where the
\text?oldstyle characters failed, I am remembering that the
codepoints from U+E000 to U+F8FF are a private use area,
and, therefore, the values above for \textoneoldstyle and
\textnineoldstyle can only work with special arrangements.
I don't know what the values for these should be.  Tex4ht's
invocation of the private use area suggests to me that the
\text?oldstyle characters do not have public codepoints.

I decided to run your example through xelatex (using
textcomp and not fontspec).  It used the unicode font
LMRoman.  I examined that and found \textoneoldstyle in the
private use area at F644 and \textnineoldstyle at F64C.  I
then modified tex4ht's codes to use those values and
modified tex4ht's html output to invoke my webfont version of
Latin Modern Roman (made from lmroman12-regular.otf as found
in texlive using Jonathan Kew's sfnt2woff and served through
my private web server).  It works.

I would say that this is an error in TeX4ht support for the particular
font used in this document. We have tables with mapping from character
codes to Unicode for fonts supported by TeX4ht. Originally, these
mapping were created by hand, but we can create them automatically
using Htfgen now:

https://github.com/michal-h21/htfgen

The Unicode characters are based on glyph names used in the fonts. We
use glyphlists from various sources, and some of them contain mapping
from glyphs to private unicode area. Which is bad, as these cannot
reliably work in browsers. The current version of Htfgen ignores such
mappings, but this  font mapping was created by an older version that
didn't ignore them.

This is why PUA characters are used. I will fix the mapping in TeX4ht
to use regular numbers instead. Old style numbers can be requested
using CSS.

Best regards,
Michal

Michal --

Thanks for your reply.

You write in part:

> This is why PUA characters are used. I will fix the mapping in TeX4ht
> to use regular numbers instead. Old style numbers can be requested
> using CSS.

And thanks for pointing out the option of using, e.g.,
<span style="font-variant-numeric: oldstyle-nums;">9</span>
instead of a PUA entry with a corresponding webfont.

The first thing I want to point out here, as you yourself
must know, is that the (relatively new) CSS option will not
work with an arbitrary font.  In particular, it does not
work with the default serif font in my browser.  The old
style numerals must exist somewhere in the font, and I see
that as a kludge.

Moreover, some authors, for example TEI encoders, will (or
should) see \textnineoldstyle as differing from the regular
"9" at the content level.  If that is so, then making the
distinction between them only with style code is a semantic
loss.  It is like having \textminus and the various dashes
be CSS-characterized versions of the ascii hyphen.  ( And
this in a world where the ascii apostrophe (&#x27;) should
never appear in HTML because the glyph for it should, it is
said, always be identical to the glyph for the
right-single-quote.  :-) )

I would rather see the TeX community standardize the PUA,
synced with Latin Modern, for itself, and then down the road
leverage that to argue for public unicode slots for the ten
old-style numerals.

Hello,

I come across? an unexpected issue with the pdf file of a book written 
with eplain. I turns out that accented letters are not recognized by the 
pdf. is there anything I can modify either in the source or in the pdf 
to make accents recognized?
Many thanks in advance for any help.

Message-ID: <SN6PR08MB5582117AAEB1E3EFC5F08C6EBE5E9@SN6PR08MB5582.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>


I'm going to try to put TooBib up as a "mail order" service allowing someone 
to mail a set of URL's to the automated handler 
("Mikemail" until I find a better name) and get back various kinds
of bibtex once I can be fairly sure headless chrome via "Chromate"
( my c++ interface to the Chrome debug protocol via web socket utility
wscat for now until I can integrate a library ) 
can not do any damage pointed at malicious sites ( and no I won't have
it pointing to my cookies lol ). I played with this a little locally
and think it has some potential but personally I like email as
a central repository for documenting various activities. It also
has potential for a lot of uses including commercial putting
ads in the replies or other useful information. 
This will be even more interesting when it gets to "BomTex"
or citations for a bill-of-materials. 
Initially it
will just run on my desktop polling the email account when
I'm not developing the code so response will be spotty.   

I'd like to imagine the ability to cite any site and popular news
stories may be worth citing beyond posting links. I happen to look
at this CCN article to compare to Zotero. Zotero is certainly
a lot "nicer" while I'm just making sure there are no profanities :)
However, in the original spirit of bibtex I include a lot more stuff
by default and as things evolve there could be a lot there. One option
will be to get all sources of bibtex and this can be surprisingly diverse.
It looks like Zotero does a lot of curation and not sure if there
are options for that. 

In this case, we seem to differ on the author order and I include
the site provided update info which may even be consistent with
their advertized update time. Zotero appears to have added braces
and maybe you can argue about the entry name style but these are all
options that can be added.

Subject: How do I make an offset table?
Message-ID: <20220125193912.7775f1a7@Zen-II-x12.niklas.com>

Hello,
I wanted to create 2 tables. One should be next to the other, but have a
50% vertical offset. The idea is that the second table will have a task,
and the first will have a time. That way I can easily see when a task
ends and the next begins. A traditional two column table would work, but
it would be confusing.

Example:
(Offset is one full line. I wanted 50%.)

9:00
      1st task
10:00
      2nd task
11:00
      3rd task
12:00

David

Hi

For personal reasons there won't be a TeX Hour tomorrow. The next TeX Hour
will be on Thursday 3 February. The topic will be Basics, by which I mean
the fundamental concepts and technologies relating to TeX, Typography,
Written Language and Communication.

However, the next TeX Hour will be focussed on 2022 basics, not the basics
of 1978 (nearly 50 years ago). The basics are the forces that enable and
shape for success typesetting as a tool used for communication.

Meetings are Thursday 6:30 to 7:30pm UK(=GMT) time. UK time now:
https://time.is/UK.
The URL is:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Here's an example of rethinking Typography.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography*: *Typography is the art and
technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and
appealing when displayed.

Me, today: Modern Typography for the Blind is the art and technique of
audible, tactile and interaction conventions that make written language
legible, readable and appealing when rendered for a blind person.

In other words, Typography and User EXperience (UX) are roughly equal
partners. And "page" is a word that means both web page and printed page.
And MathJax is for many their first experience of TeX.

wishing you Happy TeXing

Jonathan

Well in LaTeX it works (if you use T1 encoding). So yes it is
possible by using the right font (perhaps you need also a cmap or
glyphtounicode). 

But I don't know if there exist some premade support in eplain.

I'm really replying to G?rald Tenenbaum.

First, I don't know what the statement "accented letters are
not recognized by the pdf" means.  If we're talking about
typesetting with pdftex, then I think that the PDF output is
UTF-8 encoded.  If one runs the program "pdftotext", which
is part of an Ubuntu package called poppler-utils on my
Ubuntu platform, the output text is UTF-8 encoded.  I think
that text TeX's algorithmic accents are implemented using
Unicode combining characters.  Thus \'e in TeX source
becomes an e followed by U+0301 (which in UTF-8 encoding is
0xCC0x81).  I believe the same statement applies if xetex is
used.

On the other hand, xetex assumes by default that the TeX
source is UTF-8 encoded unicode.  It's still OK to enter
\'e, and if you do, you'll get the combining acute accent.
If you want to get U+00E9 in PDF, which is the real thing,
then enter ?.  (It's easy enough to change, for example,
with GNU Emacs using "query-replace".)  You'll need to
specify a suitable unicode opentype (or truetype) font such
as "Latin Modern Roman".  Note: I think I've seen trouble
with xetex when one tries to mix things like \"o with real
unicode characters, say, ?.

Another method, more devious, that allows you to keep \'e is
to wrap the plain code, with the loading of a suitable
unicode font, in LaTeX.  Thus, you can run the following
through xelatex (not xetex).  Since I seldom use plain, I've
not tested this approach very much at all.

\documentclass{minimal}
\begin{document}
% plain wrapped in LaTeX
\font\lmr="Latin Modern Roman"
\lmr

This is e-acute: \'e.
\end{document}

For a more elaborate example, see my blog
https://mathbygellmu.blogspot.com/2022/01/xetexAccentHandling.html

No.

No, not with pdftex. If you compile

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
? ? ? ? ?
\end{document}

and then copy and paste you will get

    ?a ?o ?u ?e `e

that is 
   
    U+00A8a U+00A8o U+00A8u U+00B4e U+0060e

(U+00A8 is for example diaresis).

So no combining accents involved. And pdf viewer typically can't
search for this accented chars and you can't copy this in other
applications.

if you add \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} and so use a font which has the
needed glyphs then you get the correct unicode code points and a
searchable pdf

     ? ? ? ? ?

Oh! I should have mentioned that I am using Latex. If there's some

I do understand that a PDF file is not a text file if that
is why you are saying "no".  But ...

  ^^^^^^^^^

When I said that I was using TeX's *algorithmic* accents,
I meant  \"a \"o \"u \'e \`e

But, anyway, the original question was about
plain TeX, not LaTeX, and I was trying to address
that.

I have not been able to duplicate what you say.

Perhaps you have a newer version of pdftex.  Mine
is from TeXLive 2017.  But I doubt if that is the
explanation.  Perhaps there are differences in
"locale" arrangements.

With what input encoding for your LaTeX source?  Are you
saying that you have an arrangement for pdflatex to read
unicode up U+00FF when text-encoded as UTF-8 (as in your
last email) ??

That a converter outputs utf8 doesn't mean that it is there. You can
also convert pdf to html but that doesn't mean html is in the pdf. 

In a pdf only a few strings use something related to utf8 encoding
and none of them are related to text output.

That doesn't matter. LaTeX will process this as ? -> \"a. You would
get the same if you input with commands.

The core problems are quite similar in plain.

There should be no difference in texlive 2017 here.

utf8. If you have an older latex you will perhaps have to declare it
with

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}. In newer latex that is the default.

Yes.

I think what you want is a two tables,
each inside a minipage of half textwidth

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{tabular}{ll}\hline
a&b\\
c&d\\
\hline
e&f\\
g&h\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{tabular}{ll}%\toprule
a&b\\
c&d\\
%\midrule
e&f\\
g&h\\
%\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}

Perhaps this.  (For something serious the first argument of
\raisebox should be defined in terms of lengths.)

perhaps one could typeset it twice:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\newcommand{\timetask}[2]{#1\\ \kern\offset #2\\}
\newcommand{\foo}{%
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \timetask{08:00}{breakfast}
    \timetask{13:00}{lunch}
    \timetask{17:00}{dinner}
  \end{tabular}%
}
\newdimen\offset\offset=0pt
\newbox\tbox
\setbox\tbox=\hbox{\foo}
\offset=0.5\wd\tbox
\begin{center}
\foo
\end{center}
\end{document}

But that is a 100% vertical offset, is it not Hartmut ?

oh yes, thanks & sorry, i should have better read the original mail.
Then maybe this one:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\newdimen\off\off=-0.5\baselineskip
\begin{center}
  \newcommand{\timetask}[2]{#1 & \\[\off] & #2\\[\off]}
