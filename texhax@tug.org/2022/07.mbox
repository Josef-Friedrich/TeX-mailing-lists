Subject: citing Wikipedia, kind of interesting case
Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB6338A07FBCB788689E39D062BEBF9@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>


I know, there is a lot of discussion on citing it due
to reliability, authorship,etc, but even non-credible
sources made need to be cited for no other
reason than to criticise them :) In this case,
wikipedia is an accessible moderated source
of broad interest that is usually close enough
for many audiences. 

In that context, I wanted to cite this,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D

and found TooBib no longer worked. Zotero
returned something but it did not
seem useful,


@misc{noauthor_vitamin_2022,
	title = {Vitamin d},
	copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
	url = {},
	abstract = {Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, and many other biological effects.  In humans, the most important compounds in this group are vitamin D3 (also known as cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol).The major natural source of the vitamin is synthesis of cholecalciferol in the lower layers of epidermis of the skin through a chemical reaction that is dependent on sun exposure (specifically UVB radiation). Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol can be ingested from the diet and supplements. Only a few foods, such as the flesh of fatty fish, naturally contain significant amounts of vitamin D. In the U.S. and other countries, cow's milk and plant-derived milk substitutes are fortified with vitamin D, as are many breakfast cereals. Mushrooms exposed to ultraviolet light contribute useful amounts of vitamin D2. Dietary recommendations typically assume that all of a person's vitamin D is taken by mouth, as sun exposure in the population is variable and recommendations about the amount of sun exposure that is safe are uncertain in view of the skin cancer risk.Vitamin D from the diet, or from skin synthesis, is biologically inactive. It is activated by two protein enzyme hydroxylation steps, the first in the liver and the second in the kidneys. As vitamin D can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals if exposed to sufficient sunlight, it is not essential, so technically not a vitamin. Instead it can be considered a hormone, with activation of the vitamin D pro-hormone resulting in the active form, calcitriol, which then produces effects via a nuclear receptor in multiple locations.Cholecalciferol is converted in the liver to calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol); ergocalciferol is converted to 25-hydroxyergocalciferol. These two vitamin D metabolites (called 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)D) are measured in serum to determine a person's vitamin D status. Calcifediol is further hydroxylated by the kidneys and some of the immune system cells to form calcitriol (also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, having a major role regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate, and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone. Calcitriol also has other effects, including some on cell growth, neuromuscular and immune functions, and reduction of inflammation.Vitamin D has a significant role in calcium homeostasis and metabolism. Its discovery was due to effort to find the dietary substance lacking in children with rickets (the childhood form of osteomalacia). Vitamin D supplements are given to treat or to prevent osteomalacia and rickets. The evidence for other health effects of vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D-replete individuals is inconsistent. The effect of vitamin D supplementation on mortality is not clear, with one meta-analysis finding a small decrease in mortality in elderly people. Except for the prevention of rickets and osteomalacia in high-risk groups, any benefit of vitamin D supplements to musculoskeletal or general health may be small.},

I guess it is enough info for many uses and I can't figure out where
they got the abstract although it looks like a copy of the first
section of article text. When I took a look, like many other
sites, wikipedia put the cool info into json format 
but in a less obvious location. Right now TooBib comes
up with the outpue shown below. Several issues though.
For dynamic content even a "day" may not be good enough
time resolution  to make it easy for a reader to verify
whatever assertion you are making.  TooBib included
whatever it can find, in this case including modification
time,  allowing a reader manually put it in and alert
a maintainer "the truth is out there." Also all the TooBib
bibtex includes the originating request url, "srcurl"
to make verification and replay easier. This may differ
from the prefered url and is often an issue with full text
pages or pdf files. Their webform is not very encouraging if
it is meant to illustrate the citation discovery capabilities
of zotero although for many application I'm sure it is ok.
Their full install may be a lot better but based on the
forum it sounds like a lot of features I would never
use like Word integration :) I guess I'm trying to get
to a universal scraper that can store a "last successful
strategy" somewhere to speed up future requests until 
a web site changes again.

I was curious about this, 

https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/3/639

with the Zotero web form returning this, 

@article{grant_narrative_2022,
	title = {A narrative review of the evidence for variations in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentration thresholds for optimal health},
	volume = {14},
	copyright = {http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/},

	abstract = {Vitamin D3 has many important health benefits. Unfortunately, these benefits are not widely known among health care personnel and the general public. As a result, most of the world?s population has serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations far below optimal values. This narrative review examines the evidence for the major causes of death including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and COVID-19 with regard to sub-optimal 25(OH)D concentrations. Evidence for the beneficial effects comes from a variety of approaches including ecological and observational studies, studies of mechanisms, and Mendelian randomization studies. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are generally considered the strongest form of evidence for pharmaceutical drugs, the study designs and the conduct of RCTs performed for vitamin D have mostly been flawed for the following reasons: they have been based on vitamin D dose rather than on baseline and achieved 25(OH)D concentrations; they have involved participants with 25(OH)D concentrations above the population mean; they have given low vitamin D doses; and they have permitted other sources of vitamin D. Thus, the strongest evidence generally comes from the other types of studies. The general finding is that optimal 25(OH)D concentrations to support health and wellbeing are above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality rate, whereas the thresholds for several other outcomes appear to range up to 40 or 50 ng/mL. The most efficient way to achieve these concentrations is through vitamin D supplementation. Although additional studies are warranted, raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations to optimal concentrations will result in a significant reduction in preventable illness and death.},

but the "han" month appears to be wrong. This may be an issue with "real" 
print date vs date on the journal but probably not in 
this case,  history from the html:  

Received: 7 January 2022 / Revised: 25 January 2022 / Accepted: 28 January 2022 / Published: 2 February 2022

I was puzzled because I had to fix some TooBib date code recently.
The first TooBib hit is below but using the "-all" mode 
I found the source of the "jan" month by grepping the 14 candidates
TooBib found it looks like the html contains a citiation_publication_date
entry of 2022/1 making another instance where the html from the
site seems incorrect.

... etc ... 

The first TooBib hit used crossref to look up the scraped DOI. From the
local copy of the PDF it did about the same thing,

I'd post this on the Zotero forum but AFAICT they are blocking
my contributions to humanity and this tedious task does
encounter a lot of problems :) I am getting a bit sarcastic
because this scraping is detracting from more important
stuff but it should be fixed...
With a URL and DOI it is unlikely to matter if a month is
wrong and I tend to prefer to credit the authors
with the earliest useful date but that is another
issue if you are trying to establish the evolution of
thought on some topic of just who got there first...

Message-ID: <202207042243.264MhusN015886@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers,

Another month of epidemics, political turmoil, wars and looming hunger.
It is difficult to imagine this, looking at the serene San Francisco Bay
with its calm waters during a beautiful summer sunset. This brings to
mind the lines by Sara Teasdale, chosen by Ray Bradbury for his short
story. The poem was written in 1918 when another pandemic and war
ravaged the world,

     There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,
     And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

     And frogs in the pools singing at night,
     And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;

     Robins will wear their feathery fire
     Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

     And not one will know of the war, not one
     Will care at last when it is done.

     Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree
     If mankind perished utterly;

     And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,
     Would scarcely know that we were gone.

July is the month of celebration for my American readers. This day the
Independence Declaration was passed in 1776. I congratulate them with
this great date, and would like to remind them of the episode from the
journal of James McHenry, a delegate of the Constitution Convention. The
episode occurred at another important day in American history, September 18,
1787, when the Convention adjourned. ``A lady asked Dr. Franklin,
Well Doctor what have we got, a republic or a monarchy ... A republic,
replied the Doctor, if you can keep it.'' The lady in question was
Elizabeth Willing Powel; interestingly enough, her name was omitted in
many retellings of this story in the last centuries. One of the signs of
the changing times is that we no longer put up with the anonymity of
women in our history.

July is also the month of our main conference, TUG 2022,
https://tug.org/tug2022/ (July 22-24). The program is exciting and
covers many interesting topics from Accessibility to XeTeX (I did not
find presentations covering the two last letters of the alphabet, unless
a last minute submission arrives). If you did not register yet for the
conference, please do so. We also need volunteers to moderate sessions
and to manage break rooms and social events. If you want to help, please
contact the conference committee (email tug2022 at tug.org). I also would
like to express gratitude to our conference sponsors: DANTE e.V.,
Google, Overleaf, speedata, STM Document Engineering Pvt Ltd, University
of Adelaide (Australia).

The conference will also feature our Annual General Meeting.

Among other important upcoming meetings are:
- the 16th ConTeXt Meeting: Dreifelden, Germany, Sept. 12-18, 2022.
https://meeting.contextgarden.net/2022/
- BachoTeX 2022: Bachotek, Poland, Sept. 21-25, 2022.
https://www.gust.org.pl/bachotex/2022-en

In other news, I am glad to report that Andreas Papasalouros and Antonis
Tsolomitis have reported the successful implementation of the
latex2nemeth translator from LaTeX to Braille+Nemeth math, including
support of almost all of amsmath. The project was supported by Aegean
University and the TUG development fund. See
https://myria.math.aegean.gr/labs/dt/braille/index-en.html and
https://ctan.org/pkg/latex2nemeth. The TUG development fund is
continuously accepting applications. Everybody is welcome to apply:

https://www.latex-project.org/news/latex2e-news/ltnews35.pdf, has many
interesting features, including a new way to define metadata, the new
latex-lab bundle (https://ctan.org/pkg/latex-lab and latex-lab-dev) for
experimentation with the metadata and tagging, a new mark mechanism,
key/value options treatment, and many other improvements.

In May I had a sad duty to report the death of our longstanding
colleague Dave Walden.  Recently the IEEE published a new issue of
the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, which includes his
(probably) last paper as (co-)author, "Seeking High IMP Reliability in
Maintenance of the 1970s ARPAnet": https://doi.org/10.1109/mahc.2022.3171970

New packages on CTAN in June:

- asternote, annotation symbols enclosed in square brackets and marked
  with an asterisk;
- cprotectinside, use cprotect arbitrarily nested;
- csassignments, a wrapper for article with macros and customizations
  specifically for computer science assignments;
- dvisirule, superimpose the covered hline and vline in a LaTeX
  tabular/colortbl environment;
- familytree, draw family trees;
- hideanswer, generate documents with and without answers by toggling a switch;
- inlinelabel, assign equation numbers to inline equations;
- jpneduenumerate, enumerative expressions in Japanese education;
- jpnedumathsymbols, mathematical equation representation in Japanese
  education;
- latex-lab, LaTeX laboratory: Development pre-release;
- ligtype, suppress inappropriate ligatures;
- lt3luabridge, execute Lua code in any TeX engine that exposes the shell;
- magicwatermark, an easy and flexible way to set watermarks;
- multifootnote, multiple numbers for the same footnote;
- multiple-choice, LaTeX package for multiple-choice questions;
- showhyphenation, show hyphenation points;
- showkerning, showing kerns in a document;
- simples-matrices, define matrices by given list of values;
- spacekern, kerning between words and against space.

Happy TeXing!

Hi

The TeX Hour for the next three weeks (Thursday 7, 14 and 21 July) will be
an Open Space. All  are welcome, especially from beginners and outsiders. I
hope to hold further Open Space meetings on Accessibility later this year.

TeX Hour: Open Space: Thursday 7, 14, 21 July, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
UK Time Now: https://time.is/UK.

Here are my links for the Open Hours. But your contributions will get
priority (if you wish).

TeX Conference
=============
The 2022 TeX Conference is July 22 to 24 July. https://tug.org/tug2022/.
Registration (free or donation) is still open.

International Congress of Mathematicians
================================
The 2022 International Congress of Mathematicians is happening right now.
The ICM was due to be held in St Petersburg, Russia. At short notice it's
been replaced by an online conference, with in-person events in Finland.
This enormous step will influence mathematical communication for many years.

The prizes were announced yesterday (in Finland, and streamed on YouTube).

 Anything related to the ICM is welcome at the Open Space. I've a special
interest in the mathematics of June Huh, who was awarded the first Fields
Medal for combinatorics.

Subject: Using ISO date format in letter class
Message-ID: <Ysyaa+2xK50j/suU@lenin.histomat.net>

I have a lualatex document that uses the letter class. I find that 
this class automatically inserts the state to the right following the 
senders' mame and addrress.

The date is displayed default with the format July 11, 2022.

I prefer the date be closer to the ISO standard. I want it to be like 
the output of

  \def\mydate{\leavevmode\hbox{\the\year.\twodigits\month.\twodigits\day}}
  \def\twodigits#1{\ifnum#1<10 0\fi\the#1}
 
  which is 2022.07.11

I tried placing \newcommand*\today{\number\year.\number\month.\number\day}
into the preamble, but lualatex complains that \today haa already 
been defined.

Dear Texhax,
I see code like @t\4@> a lot in mf.web and elsewhere, and seem to recall it has something to do with inlining code or something.  The CWEB manual doesn't tell me much, and I was wondering what \1-\9 do and what a control token is?

Thanks,

I don't know what \4 does, Daniel, nor \2 which also appears, but the 
answer will probably lie somewhere in tangle.web, weave.web, webman.tex 
or webmac.web.? CWEB doesn't really come into the equation.

Hello, Daniel,

Indeed, "@t stuff @>" puts "stuff" in WEAVE's TeX output (wrapped in an
\hbox{}). '\4' means "backspace one notch".

> The CWEB manual doesn't tell me much, and I was wondering what \1-\9

The TeX macros \1..\7 come fairly early in 'webmac.tex'. (Pascal WEB 
does not know of \8 and \9; these are defined in CWEB's 'cwebmac.tex'.)

Happy WEB programming!

I'm terribly sorry, but Thunderbird is just bad. It shows quoted text
with '>' in blue, and then scraps the line wrap. The middle section
should have been:

I ran across this page,


https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eu578/

The Zotero webform returned this,

@misc{noauthor_notitle_nodate,
        url = {https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eu578/},
        urldate = {2022-07-18},
}

I would note right now that when TooBib fails it
does not return a placeholder
but just fails and I have found that ok but can see a point
to this too.

In any case, AFAICT TooBib managed to scrape the right doi
as shown below.  As stated in the "documentation" draft,
TooBib is a collection of hacks and the DOI scraping is
one of the worst parts but it does work amazingly well
on text and pdf files. When it seems to fail often it
is due to a 404 returned from crossref because the DOI
does not exist there ( or on datasite ). Maybe for end
users that is ok but I would think you have to manually
curate these quite often and again deleting is easier than
hunting.

I did not here for example TooBib did not extract the
publication year so I just added two fields
to a list of source fields for that,

 vdate.push_back("publication-date");
 vdate.push_back("date-posted");


I'm not entirely sure of the tech behind Zotero, I thnk
I've seen nodejs and python mentioned, but with the
c++ code delefating a lot to bash invokations with
system() has worked well. Right now I'm starting
wscat to talk to headless chrome that way but can
insert a c++ websocket library when I get around to it or
never. For handling dates initially the linux/cygwin "date"
command was useful for getting proven robust date code. 

And for whatever reasons more site html seems to be bad or
difficult to download without "chromate" ( headless chrome
used as a replacement for wget , not sure if name is taken
but that is what I call it ). From the one post on the
Zotero forum it looked like one place wanted you to
pay to get the citation so maybe it is now a money thing.

Many Nutrient Profiling Systems are founded on a reductionist assumption that the healthfulness of foods is determined by the sum of their nutrients, with little consideration for the extent and purpose of processing and its health implications. A novel Nutrient Profiling System called Food Compass attempted to address existing gaps and provide a more holistic assessment of the healthfulness of foods. While a conceptually impressive effort, we propose that the chosen algorithm is not well justified and produces results that fail to discriminate for common shortfall nutrients, exaggerate the risks associated with animal-source foods, and underestimate the risks associated with ultra-processed foods. We caution against the use of Food Compass in its current form to inform consumer choices, policies, programs, industry reformulations, and investment decisions.</p>},

Message-ID: <7be714563e6f4d1a87ae16cff6d9814cBL3PR11MB63384B92DCF837E0769C8647BE8C9@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>


I ran across this page,


https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eu578/

The Zotero webform returned this,

@misc{noauthor_notitle_nodate,
	url = {https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eu578/},
	urldate = {2022-07-18},
}

I would note right now that when TooBib fails it 
does not return a placeholder
but just fails and I have found that ok but can see a point
to this too.

In any case, AFAICT TooBib managed to scrape the right doi
as shown below.  As stated in the "documentation" draft,
TooBib is a collection of hacks and the DOI scraping is
one of the worst parts but it does work amazingly well
on text and pdf files. When it seems to fail often it
is due to a 404 returned from crossref because the DOI
does not exist there ( or on datasite ). Maybe for end
users that is ok but I would think you have to manually
curate these quite often and again deleting is easier than
hunting. 

I did not here for example TooBib did not extract the
publication year so I just added two fields 
to a list of source fields for that, 

 vdate.push_back("publication-date");
 vdate.push_back("date-posted");


I'm not entirely sure of the tech behind Zotero, I thnk
I've seen nodejs and python mentioned, but with the
c++ code delefating a lot to bash invokations with 
system() has worked well. Right now I'm starting 
wscat to talk to headless chrome that way but can 
insert a c++ websocket library when I get around to it or
never. For handling dates initially the linux/cygwin "date"
command was useful for getting proven robust date code.  

And for whatever reasons more site html seems to be bad or
difficult to download without "chromate" ( headless chrome
used as a replacement for wget , not sure if name is taken
but that is what I call it ). From the one post on the
Zotero forum it looked like one place wanted you to
pay to get the citation so maybe it is now a money thing.

Many Nutrient Profiling Systems are founded on a reductionist assumption that the healthfulness of foods is determined by the sum of their nutrients, with little consideration for the extent and purpose of processing and its health implications. A novel Nutrient Profiling System called Food Compass attempted to address existing gaps and provide a more holistic assessment of the healthfulness of foods. While a conceptually impressive effort, we propose that the chosen algorithm is not well justified and produces results that fail to discriminate for common shortfall nutrients, exaggerate the risks associated with animal-source foods, and underestimate the risks associated with ultra-processed foods. We caution against the use of Food Compass in its current form to inform consumer choices, policies, programs, industry reformulations, and investment decisions.</p>},

Subject: one LaTeX source file to produce two different pdf files: one main
 manuscript and one Supplementary Materials
Message-ID: <7f503fd3-2212-6774-05e3-0b98c7a6606e@binghamton.edu>

I suppose this is a question at the intersection of LaTeX, R, Sweave. So
not entirely sure which listserve is the best place to post it.

For my statistical/academic work, I create a noweb .Rnw file and use an
R -> Sweave -> pdflatex workflow (incidentally using emacs and Emacs
Speaks Statistics as an IDE of sorts, but I think that is immaterial.)

Model-fitting produces many graphs. I generate these each as their own
pdf file, and then use

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{}
  \caption{}\label{}
\end{figure}

blocks to include them in the manuscript.

Some grpahs are for inclusion in a main manuscript, while others are
diagnostic plots assessing the adequacy of the model that probably
should be relegated at a separate pdf file of "Supplementary Materials".
Many journals accept/encourage such materials these days.

Is there a way to generate two pdf files, the main manuscript and the
Supplementary Materials, in one fell swoop (meaning compile the Rnw file
just once)? Or do I need to write a separate LaTeX source file that
includes the supplementary graphics and compile that separately? I
suspect the latter is true, and the former would be expecting too much
magic. But thought I'd ask.

Thanks.

In the past I've used `\jobname` as a switch to generate different outputs
from the same source file, but it requires two separate compile jobs (i.e.
`pdflatex -jobname=solutions problems.tex`, and then I'd use something like
(note: it's been a while so my syntax could be way off here)

```
\newif\ifsolutions
\def\solutionsjob{solutions}
\ifx\jobname\solutionsjob\solutionstrue\fi
```

If you really want to do it with a single pdflatex invocation, you could
potentially use `--shell-escape` with `\write18{pdflatex ...}` but this of
course opens up a security hole and I wouldn't recommend it for the benefit
you're gaining over a simple shell script (for instance).

Well, since you posted this to a TeX list, I will propose a TeX solution.

It *is* possible to compile Rnw file once and output two TeX files,
but it is far from trivial.   A much easier (and a fully TeX solution)
is to generate one TeX file, and then use it to generate two different
pdf files, one for the main text, one for supplement.  There are many
ways to do it;  I'd suggest multiaudience package written exactly for
this purpose (https://ctan.org/pkg/multiaudience).  The additional
advantage is that the resulting documents can overlap: for example,
you probably want to enter the list of authors only once for both
pdfs.

Hi Boris,
there is probably a more efficient solution.  What I dislike is that
you have to pass --jobname on the command line.

For people I support when writing their theses I provide two files,
thesis.tex and thesis-print.tex.  The print version does not have
colored hyperlinks, for example.

The print-version adds a few commands to the preamble and then loads
thesis.tex.  But you still have to compile both documents multiple
times in order to get everyting right.

But what happens if thesis-print.tex contains the line

  \def\jobname{thesis}  ?

The output file will still be "thesis-print.pdf" because the PDF
file is opened before this piece of code processed.

But LaTeX is using \jobname in order to determine the names of toc,
aux, ... files.

With \def\jobname{thesis} thesis-print.tex steals all the auxiliary
files from the previous run (theis.tex).  This saves a lot of time.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi

First a personal word about the climate emergency, then tomorrow's TeX
Hour. Abstracts for my TeX 2022 Conference talks are in Appendix.

Earlier this week the heat dome over Europe split out onto the UK. (Brexit
did not protect us. The laws of physics do not obey the laws of society.)
On Monday and Tuesday we had record temperatures, reaching 40.2 C. In the
dry hot weather there were many fires. No more green and pleasant land.

Tuesday afternoon was the worst, and for about 5 hours it felt that my home
was heating up in a hot oven. I now better feel sympathy and solidarity for
those suffering much more than I am from the climate emergency.

Normal service, including refreshing rain, has now resumed. There will be a
TeX Hour tomorrow. It will be an Open House. All topics and persons
welcome, particularly beginners and new visitors.

TeX Hour: Open Space: Thursday 21 July, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
UK Time Now: https://time.is/UK.

Tomorrow and Friday I'll be preparing my talks for the TeX 2022 Conference.
My titles are

   - Access and Accessibility
   - The UK TeX Users Group - a personal history

Here's the TeX 2022 Conference  (free of charge):
https://tug.org/tug2022/index.html

with best wishes

APPENDIX A: Access and Accessibility

The Chafee Amendment [1] to US copyright law "allows authorized entities to
reproduce or distribute copies or phonorecords of previously published
literary or musical works in accessible formats exclusively for use by
print-disabled persons."

This wonderful legal exemption to copyright nicely illustrates the relation
between access (here to print works) and accessibility (here production of
phonorecords, i.e. audiobooks). Here's another illustration.

Jonathan Godfrey, a blind Senior Lecturer in Statistics in New Zealand
wrote to the Blind Math list [2] "I used to use TeX4HT as my main tool for
getting HTML from LaTeX source. This was and probably still is, an
excellent tool. How much traction does it get though? Not much. Why? I
don't know, but my current theory is that tools that aren't right under
people's noses or automatically applied in the background just don't get as
much traction."

Jonathan Godfrey also wrote to the BlindMath list [3] "Something has to
change in the very way people use LaTeX if we are ever to get truly
accessible pdf documents. I've laboured the point that we need access to
information much more than we need access to a specific file format, and
I'll keep doing so. [...] I do think a fundamental shift in thinking about
how we get access to information is required across most STEM disciplines."

This talk looks at the experience of visually impaired STEM students and
professionals, from both the point of view of easy access to suitable
inputs and tools and also the generation of accessible outputs, as
pioneered and enabled by the Chafee Amendment.

APPENDIX B: The UK TeX Users Group - a personal history

UK TUG was established in the early 1990s. I've been a member of UK TUG
almost from its start through to its dissolution earlier this year. Much
has changed both in the TeX community and in the wider world over that
time.

UK TUG was a significant part of the TeX community. Besides myself
(Jonathan Fine), former members of UK TUG include Peter Abbott, Kaveh
Bazargan, David Carlisle, Paulo Cereda, Malcolm Clark, David Crossland,
Robin Fairbairns, Alan Jeffrey, Sebastian Rahtz, Arthur Rosendahl, Chris
Rowley, Philip Taylor and Joseph Wright.

This list includes 2 past Presidents of TUG, the current Vice President and
a past Secretary.  Ten people on the list served on the TUG Board, for a
total of over 30 years.

Five are or were members of the LaTeX3 project. One was the founder and for
8 years editor of TeX Live, and another the Technical coordinator of the
NTS project. One is a Lead Program Manager for Google Fonts.

This talk provides a personal history from `\begin{uktug}` to
`\end{uktug}`, with a short `\aftergroup` appendix.

The full program is at:
  https://tug.org/tug2022/program.html

The schedule adjusts according to your computer's local timezone.
There are presentations from around the world, so everyone's local days
gets some. The conference ends on Sunday July 24 around 21:15 UTC.

Advance registration is requested (there is no charge),
but is not required: https://tug.org/tug2022/register.html

The conference will be available on Zoom and YouTube, as in previous
years. We expect that recordings of most of the talks will be available
at some point, though not immediately, after the conference.

Hope to see you online,
Karl Berry (on behalf of the TUG'22 program committee and speakers)

P.S. Please adjust all my mentions of specific days according to your
local timezone :).

Why are we forced to read TeX code in the TUG program page:
https://tug.org/tug2022/program.html
Is it not easier to read plain text? Or HTML perhaps?

Hi Kaveh,

It has been remarked by a number of people. It is being fixed.

Hi Paulo,
instead of providing a quick workaround now it would be more useful to
think about a better solution for next year, if necessary or desirable
at all.

As TeX users we are accustomed those TeX control sequences anyway
because we use them daily.  Replacing \texttt{siunitx} by
<tt>siunitx</tt> just makes the HTML file *look* better.

But for blind TeX users what we have now is even much more useful than
anything else one could imagine because they can read the markup
information on their Braille display.  They will not get this
information if \texttt{siunitx} is replaced by <tt>siunitx</tt>.  So
I'm not convinced that a "fix" makes everybody happy.

Thus my recommendation is to leave things as they are now, at least
for the time being.  I've seen TeX macros in previous TUG conference
schedules too and nobody complained.  I don't understand why it's a
problem now.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Reinhard,

I was under the impression that HTML is more accessible to the blind than
TeX source.
I could be wrong, but will look into it.

The other thing you have to consider is that -- despite the name of the
conference -- there
people there, speakers included, that know exactly nothing about TeX, and
for whom these
codes have absolutely no meaning.

That is the main reason for my suggestion. Many novices might have heard of
TeX for the first time and would be confused at the mark-up.

At the same time I can see the point for accessibility. I made a point of
attending and recording the Math for the Blind conference conference in
Milan in 2008!

That was exactly my reaction when I first read the page ? to find 
constructs such as "in a world of 21st-century technologies\Dash where 
interactive displays" just smacks of amateurism.? I realise that those 
responsible for preparing the web page are probably more experienced in 
TeX than in HTML, but if they did not know how to represent a "\Dash" in 
HTML then they should either have sought advice or else converted the 
TeX to PDF and presented the page as a PDF.? My Eur 0,02.

While one can create inaccessible html, switching from \texttt to
<tt> doesn't do that.
Screen reader of blind users can handle html markup. Beside this:
there is no conceptual difference in the meaning between \texttt and
<tt>. 

There would be a difference between \package{siunitx} and
<tt>siunitx</tt>, but proper html markup can handle that too.

Hi

Just to let you know that I intend to use this thread as a one-slide case
study for my talk Access and Accessibility at the TUG Conference. This talk
will be at 16:45 pm UK time on Sunday. I won't mention names, but I might
mention roles.

with kind regards

Jonathan

Hi

Here's my slide, as TeX source as that's perhaps most convenient. But I've
also attached the PDF. There's not enough room for any names, and besides
they're not relevant to the message.

Any suggestions on how to improve the slide, and complaints also if you
wish, are welcome.

with best wishes

Jonathan

  \frametitle{Case study: TUG Conference Abstracts}

  2022: 21 July (paraphrased)\\

  [Contributions from experienced \TeX\ users.]

  \medskip
  Why TeX source in TUG abstracts web page?\\

  \medskip
  Several have reported this. It is being fixed.

  \medskip
  As \TeX\ users we're used to reading \TeX\ code.

  \medskip
  And this is the best for blind \TeX\ users.

  \medskip
  I thought for blind HTML better than \TeX\ source.

  \medskip
  The \TeX\ source would confuse [sighted] novices.

  \medskip
  Improve the HTML or convert \TeX\ source to PDF.

That seems to me to be a very good question.  I struggled for quite
a while to find an answer and was unable to.  The "\footnotemark"
seems to get defined differently when \maketitle is invoked (in
which case it uses the footnote symbols produced by \fnsymbol{}),
from the way it is defined in "ordinary" contexts (in which case it
uses digits).

I am surprised that none of the gurus who contribute to this list have
responded to this question.  I suspect that the answer would be very
easy for them! :-)

cheers,

Hi Jonathan,
like Kaveh I have no problem if my name is mentioned.

Maybe I should provide some background information regarding my
statement.

About 20 years ago a teacher and a blind schoolboy attended our local
monthly TeX meeting at the university.  The teacher was employed by
"Landesbildungszentrum f?r Blinde Niedersachsen (LBZB)", an
organization which supports blind people's education in Lower Saxony.

In the past blind pupils attended special schools.  The LBZB launched
a pilot project where blind pupils attend regular schools, supported
by a teacher of the LBZB.

Blind pupils usually used Microsoft Word if only text is involved.
For mathematics the situation is more difficult because formulas are
two-dimensional and couldn't be displayed on a Braille line.  The
solution was that the blind typed math formulas in LaTeX syntax.
Since LaTeX (source code) formulas are one-dimesional they could
easily be read on a Braille display.

The LBZB-teacher helped whenever problems occurred with the
translation from LaTeX to PDF.  Class exams were judged by the
teachers of the regular schools, who had no idea about LaTeX at this
time.

Nowadays I assume that more teachers are familiar with LaTeX because
they used it already during their own education.

I must admit that I don't know very much about the requirements of
visually impaired people and the tools that are available now.  I've
heard about Nemeth but I actually don't know anything about it.  

After all, I've been told recently that the blind schoolboy I met
about 20 years ago now has a doctoral degree in economics.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I think we are all agreed that we want maximum accessibility for everyone
including the blind. There is a blind man, Ross, living near me and I
befriended him a while ago. We had coffee last weekend and it was
fascinating to find out more. Some memorable points that I did not know:

   - The harness on his guide dog (as opposed to the flexible lead) is a
   two-way communication channel. One example is that when the dog mounts a
   kerb, he gets a measure of the height difference from the movement of the
   harness.
   - There are no blind schools any more as integration is seen as the way
   forward. Downside is the teachers are not as specialised
   - Braille is no longer mandatory for blind kids as there is text to
   speech. We both agreed this did not seem right. It is akin to sighted
   readers always using audiobooks
   - Mobile phones, e.g. iPhone, are very accessible. He shops for
   everything online with no trouble.
   - Ross got O-level in math. For geometry he would use a wooden board
   with pins and a rubber band to draw a triangle etc!

Coming back to the original point, I think pure text would have been better
for sighted and for blind users. The code is messy and unhelpful. TeX was
not designed to be read by end users. Some examples that unnecessarily
complicate simple text:

   - \begin{itemize} \item each cell
   -  \cs{begin}\tubbraced{uktug} to \cs{end}\tubbraced{uktug}
   - \texttt{{luatruthtable}package. The \texttt{xkeyval}

Note non-matching braces in last case.

Hi

Last weekend was the 2022 TeX Conference, organised by the TeX Users Group
(TUG). It went well. I thank the organisers, volunteers, speakers and
participants. This week's TeX Hour is on The Future of TUG.  All members of
TUG, TeX users and friends are most welcome. As usual, this TeX Hour will
be recorded and published on YouTube.

Date: Thursday 28 July, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.

If you have specific ideas or topics you'd like to discuss, or are unable
to attend, please if possible email them to me soon. Here are three talks
from the TeX Conference (in order of presentation). The video URL will
change when the conference live stream is split in talks.

You may want to also try  the Zotero forum- https://www.zotero.org/ .
They apparently support bibtex but it is just part of a larger effort. 
They apparently won't let me post but maybe you will have better luck. It may fit into

Hello,
I would like to have a row with almost no entries but I cannot seem
to get the last vrule to show up where it should be.

I have two different attempts, one the the word "preesent" and the
other with "past".   I have attached a complete tex file below.  The
"present" line shows the vrule but in the wrong place.   It should be
at the rightmost end of the row!
The "past" line doesn't show a rightmost vrule.    The "subjunctive" and
"past particle" lines are similar to the "past" line.

Many thanks for any insights you can provide.

Walt Burkhard

I guess we can all easily agree that pidgin-TeX is NOT even close to any
ideal dialect to communicate with the blind - the reasons being multiple:

pidgin-TeX is extremely verbose: it takes 9 characters to do bold in TeX,
\textbf{word} while Braille does it with ONE character. A hell a lot more
concise. The rate of tactile reading is proportional to the number of
characters, and as such LaTeX is not used EVEN to represent Mathematics in
Braille.


The drivers that increase accessibility on phones and computers (sound or
tactile) do it by reading text and HTML and they will easily interpret ?,
?, ?, ... but have no idea what is ``, ' ', \Dash{}, ...

These drivers will read pidgin-TeX like


          \cot{\alpha}


by sounding the entire sequence of characters, which will make no sense for
a non-trained TeX person.


Nemeth is an ASCII linear representation of Math (just like TeX is
another), but one that is very concise and wastes no characters in the
representation.

Bottom line: there should be no space for TeX inside HTML pages, specially
for reasons of the blind.

Hi Burkhard,

I couldn't read the LaTeX-part of your message, so I'm guessing.

For the area right of "past", do you just add a line break (\\)? You
could combine the remainder of the columns into one cell using
\multicolumn, providing the necessary vertical lines so the end line is
added: \multicolumn{7}{|c|}{}, followed by the line break.

Hope that helps,
Julius

Hi Walt,
you wrote

  &&\bf present &&\multispan{14}\vrule\cr

but \multispan takes two arguments, the number of colunms to span and
the content of this "supercolumn".  Please try this:

  &&\bf present &&\multispan{14}{\hfill}\vrule\cr

In your case \multispan took \vrule as a second argument and placed it
at the very left, next to the \vrule after "\bf present" which was
already inserted by the template.

I used pdftex for testing.

>From your example file I deduce that you are teaching German.  It then
makes more sense to switch to LuaTeX or XeTeX and use UTF-8 as an
input encoding.  The reason is that if you type \"o in plain TeX the
letter ? is produced by combining o and the dieresis.  (Negative)
kerning is used for proper horizontal positioning.  But an explicit
\kern denotes a word boundary and thus prevents many possible
hyphenation points due to \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin.

In order to get proper hyphenation the font has to supply characters
with dieresis as single glyphs and with distinct code points so that
no explicit \kern is needed.

It's also more convenient to use German characters instead of TeX
macros in your TeX input file.  Operating systems and good text
editors allow you to select a proper "input method" for a particular
language.  When I select VIQR as an input method for Vietnamese I can
type "Ha` No^.i" on my German keyboard and immediately see "H? N?i" on
screen.  It's always a pleasure to see how fast Chinese type Chinese
on a German keyboard.

Regards,
  Reinhard
