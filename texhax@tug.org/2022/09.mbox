Message-ID: <202209052226.285MQHkm009419@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers,

September is upon us. I hope the days of autumn bring health and
peace to fellow TeXers.

Thanks to the hard work of TUG volunteers, all videos from TUG2022 are
now online and available from the conference main page
(https://tug.org/tug2022/) and from our YouTube channel
(https://youtube.com/c/TeXUsersGroup). It was a huge task to
edit the videos, add the metadata, check the transcriptions. I want to
thank again the volunteers who performed this task, notably
Paulo Ney de Souza, Norbert Preining, J\'er\'emy Just, Chadrack Besongo,
and Barbara Beeton. Thanks also to all the volunteers who helped
organize the conference. You rock!

The proceedings issue of TUGboat is at the printer, and is expected to
be mailed around September 13. The electronic copy will be available
for TUG members as soon as the new issue is mailed. At that time, the
spring 2022 issue, 43:1, will be publicly available. By the way, I
just reread some of the publicly available issue from fall 2021, 42:3
(https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb42-3/), and thought it was a very good one.
Many interesting tidbits, from classical typography to the modern usage
of Unicode and open street maps.

Articles for the next issue of TUGboat are most welcome. The deadline is
October 15. For the article template and other information, see
  https://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html

Speaking of TUG business, 2023 is an election year, so you might want
to consider serving on the Board. The official announcement is in
the TUGboat proceedings issue, and is also posted online:
  https://tug.org/election/

The 16th ConTeXt Meeting is scheduled for Dreifelden, Germany,
Sept. 12-18, 2022, https://meeting.contextgarden.net/2022/

In other news, last year mathematicians celebrated a centennial of a
great logician, Boris Trakhtenbrot
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Trakhtenbrot). He was born in
Moldova, studied in Ukraine, and worked in Russia and Israel. Recently
his son found unique photos of him, Stephen C Kleene and DEK picking
cotton in Uzbekistan. You can find these photos on DEK's page, just
above the list of lectures:
https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news.html#lectures

Hi

The TeX Hour now has a website https://texhour.github.io/ and full details
of future meetings will be posted there. The Zoom and YouTube details are
at https://texhour.github.io/about/.

Date: Thursday 8 September, 6:30 to 7:30 BST (UK time).
Title: Publish with Jekyll and LaTeX compared.
This TeX Hour is about publishing. It compares the process with LaTeX (for
PDF) and with Jekyll (for HTML). This includes installation, authoring and
publication.
URL: https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/08/publish-jekyll-and-latex-compared/

Date: Thursday 29 September,  6:30 to 8:30 BST (UK time).
Title: Rethinking TeX in STEM.
This special meeting of the TeX Hour is fortunate to have three special
guests. Peter Williams will speak about Tectonic. Martin Ruckert will speak
about HINT. Dennis M?ller will speak about sTeX.

The 29 September TeX Hour has  two parts. The first hour will be
presentations followed by a panel discussion, with audience questions and
contributions. The second hour, which is optional, will be more like a
workshop. If numbers require we will break into small groups of about 8. It
would help if you could register in advance.
URL: https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/29/rethink-tex-in-stem/
Register: https://forms.gle/j5opJ7bjkjDJFYJ98

wishing you happy authoring, publishing and reading

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is open to all topics. Come and share your screen to
present something if you wish. The Zoom and YouTube details are at
https://texhour.github.io/about/.

Date: Thursday 15 September, 6:30 to 7:30 BST (UK time).
Title: All topics welcome

I'm catching up on the YouTube backlog. Already available (and all
recommended if you're interested in accessibility, the arXiv or the future
of TeX in STEM) are:

8 Sep 2022: Publish with Jekyll and LaTeX compared:
https://youtu.be/tcpJSOQzzKM
8 Sep 2022: Extra: Mainly web and HTML and arXiv:
https://youtu.be/nUg2cH1QrlQ
1 Sep 2022: The Future of TeX (Knuth) and Tagged PDF (Mittelbach and
Rowley): https://youtu.be/VvtZA2i-veg

Next week (Thu 22 Sep) I'll present my recent progress on using git as an
archiving and distribution system for the TeX Live distribution. So this
week it's over to you, if you wish.

On Thu 29 Sep (6:30 to 8:30 BST) we have a special TWO HOUR long TeX Hour
focussed on Rethinking TeX in STEM, and with THREE special guests (with
workshops in the second hour).

   - Peter Williams will speak about Tectonic
   - Martin Ruckert will speak about HINT
   - Dennis M?ller will speak about sTeX

Hi Jonathan, everyone,

I am pleased that you had time and interest in discussing some of the finer
points around generating HTML for arXiv. Some interesting open questions to
consider.

If I may, I would like to contribute a quick point of information:

I have recently started working on "locally running latexml for arXiv" for
users who can't stomach the installation process. With a basic familiarity
with Docker, one can already use a turnkey solution, while letting Docker
take care of the installation details. More details on that here:
https://github.com/dginev/ar5ivist

I think there is still room to make it more convenient. I would like to
create a template github repository with a Github Action that automatically
deploys the HTML to gh-pages on "git push" for a LaTeX source - just as you
were describing in the call Jonathan.

Similarly, I know Overleaf has had interest in utilizing latexml since
2017, and maybe there is a way to inspire them to expose an "ar5iv HTML"
preview to their users in the foreseeable future.

I enjoy a healthy challenge. We can make the systems that make ar5iv
possible even better, especially when we have an explicit laundry list of
where they fall short today. So please send feedback our way, and we'll
keep the ball rolling.

And of course - do evaluate the other conversion tools available today. I
am just as curious as everyone about how arXiv is converted through each of
them, especially with a rigorous evaluation on the resulting HTML quality
and the fidelity of the browser rendering.

As always, thank you for making these conversations public, for everyone to
enjoy and learn from!

Greetings,
Deyan

Greetings - (with apologies to those who registered for TUG'22
and hence get this twice.)

We are now starting planning for TUG'23, and would like your feedback on
whether we should organize an in-person conference (in addition to the
online component).

If you are willing and interested, please fill out this very short
survey (three questions, all optional) to help us plan for TUG'23:
   https://forms.gle/yPmiXUS7Y2j8iwjq8

Again, many thanks!

On behalf of the entire conference committee,
Karl Berry (tug2022 at tug.org)


P.S. Back on TUG'22 for a moment, just to let you know:

1) Videos for all the talks at TUG'22 are now
individually available on TUG's YouTube channel:
  https://youtube.com/c/TeXUsersGroup/

2) The proceedings (TUGboat vol.43 no.2) will start to be mailed
shortly.  The issue is online at: https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb43-2
(For now, technical articles are only available online to TUG members;
all articles will be publicly available after the November TUGboat issue
is published.)

 I've  taken a look at these details. I'd be most grateful if you could
talk me through the process. I'd rather be using distrobox (with podman
underneath) rather than Docker. But I'm confident that won't be a problem.
Would you like to come along tonight and do that with me? I'd be most
grateful (and apologies for the short notice).

with best regards

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is "Using Git to subset TeX Live".

Date: Thursday 22 September, 6:30 to 7:30 BST (UK time).
Zoom and YouTube details are at https://texhour.github.io/about/

Famously, Don Knuth?s TeX produces identical outputs from identical inputs.
It is reproducible computing, across space time and platform. It provides
archival quality digital documents. This talk is about ensuring identical
inputs from TeX Live in a quick and economical way. For more see:
https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/22/git-subset-tex-live/

On Thu 29 Sep (6:30 to 8:30 BST) we have a special TWO HOUR long TeX Hour
focussed on Rethinking TeX in STEM, and with THREE special guests (with
workshops in the second hour).

    Peter Williams will speak about Tectonic
    Martin Ruckert will speak about HINT

Hi

I write to warmly invite you to a one hour online meeting on TeX in STEM,
followed by an optional one-hour workshop. It will take place on Thursday
29 September at 6:30pm BST (UK time). Please forward this invitation to
others if you wish. Here are the most important links:

Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.

We are fortunate to have as main speakers Peter Williams, Dennis M?ller and
Martin Ruckert. All three have projects (Tectonic, sTeX and HINT) based on
rethinking TeX for our changed times. All three have spoken on this at the
annual TeX Conference organised by the TeX Users Group. For more
information see:

https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/29/rethink-tex-in-stem/

The world has moved on since the 1990s (and the invention of the
world-wide-web). Print and PDF no longer dominate as they did, even in the
world of STEM publishing. Here's an example, which surprised me, of just
how good HTML can be for heavily mathematical STEM content. Quality
technical typography is no longer confined to print media (and its digital
representation PDF):

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)
Lattices in Tate modules
Bjorn Poonena and Sergey Rybakov
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2113201118  # HTML
https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2113201118 # PDF

In late November or early December there will be another special TeX Hour,
this time focussed on LaTeX and Accessibility. We're pleased that Jonathan
Godfrey, a blind senior lecturer in Statistics and stalwart of the Blind
Math list, will be one of our special guests. For more details see:

with kind regards

For something befitting the education of technically capable people, one thing is to reject Zoom.
Zoom is unjust, because it requires users to run nonfree? programs, mistreating and limiting users.? 
Zoom lied to users for years about its software's encryption capability and security. It also

Besides sending personal data straight te Facebook, Zoom enforces Chinese censorship against

Do you have any suggestions for a substitute?

Open Source evangelist that believe there is only one god should show the
way.

There are many quarters of the software space where there is no OS
equivalent -- try pre-press, for example. There are no open source software
that can determine the color spaces of a PDF file.

The Calyx Institute also offers a free, public Jitsi Meet server. I like
this a lot better than zoom. I used it for the first time in a teaching
event at my university and worked great. My other employer, a county
government, blocks it, sadly. And for reasons I don't understand.

Paulo, I thank you for your question.  Remember that since 2013, Gnu runs the computing needs of
the International Space Station.  When one is in unfamiliar territory, you can only progress
consciously by seeking the assistance of a local guide.  For one thing, calling us "Open Source 
Evangelists" show that you have no idea about the people you are talking about.  Saying that we 
are Open Source Evangelists is like saying that "Cows Have Wings" or "If my mother had wheels she 
would be a motorcycle".  Completely wrong.

You know what happened to Columbus when he went by himself?  He wanted to go to India and 
ended up in America.  Do you know how many thousands of sailors did not even manage to land
anywhere?  If you go somewhere without any guidance, this is what will happen.  I am not saying
you cannot do it by yourself, but we do not know how many lifetimes it will take by yourself.
Not that it is impossible, but 99% of the people will just get lost and washed away. 

There are Jitsi, BigBlueButton and Jami.

Jami is a peer-to-peer serverless system, which I like.  But if you are at a terrible
venue, they might have a firewall blocking non-web ports, you have a problem.  Jami is
able to punch through NATs if you stress it.

Jitsi also works well.  The Jitsi server is a heavyweight.

BigBlueBotton also works, but one needs an account somewhere. And again, BigBlueBotton is
also resource intensive.

Subject to the laws of libel, you are, of course, free to express your 
opinions on any subject under the sun.? However, "technically capable 
people", as you refer to them, will be very familiar with the concept of 
references.? May I therefore respectfully suggest that if you wish your 
views to be taken seriously, rather than just more? misguided 
"proprietary software is evil" propaganda, you back up each of your 
assertions with a reference to a reliable and reputable source, the 
authority of which is beyond all reasonable doubt?

This is where me disagree.  It is a valid contrarian view for the absolute requirement
of documented proof by what some decide to call authority.  Naturally, I am not here
to dictate how people run the event.  For one thing, this shows how computer science and
computer engineering departments today are not providing much innovation to their
community.  What people can do is to encourage their computer science and computer
engineering departments about the value of working on honest development of technology
that serves the best interests of those who use the software rather than some other entity.

I provided an explanation on valid reasons to thumb down the use of Zoom.  But some got really
offended.  I am used to the approach of individuals whose modus-operandi involve insults,
shame, guilt and the need to be right.  People whose education has educated them out of it.

I did not have more to say than the initial comments.  Yet I see quite a few starting freaking
out about it.  It is the latter part that has been unnecessary.  Who have I disrespected exactly.
The mathematical community has a reputation in the world that it can take criticism.  But perhaps
Grigori Perelman was right to reject the community's accolades.  So I shall continue to be his
friend and agree with him.

Christopher, this is not the forum to be talking about extermination 
camps in any circumstances. It is way off topic from the initial 
discussion on Zoom and free software alternatives. I do understand the 
point you are making in regards to the use of alternatives but not when 
it comes to the atrocities that happened at these camps.

I would ask that you apologise for your comments on this list and 
refrain from using these in the future

I am sorry being off topic but I do not understand it well. The zoom
server which hosts my meetings is physically located in the Czech
Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic, and is operated by the
best experts at network security. Can you explain me how exactly the
server is censored from China and how the personal data are leaked? I
will then forward it to the experts and they will certainly find a
solution and make it available to other hosts. Anyway, in both the
open source and closed source SW it is normal that people do not just
speak about vulnerabilities but they either fix them and publish the
patches or report them immediately to expert. Why you have not done
that? These vulnerabilities could have been fixed a long time ago if
you acted as you should.

In the open source world meritocracy is applied. Those who contribute
most have higher right to decide. Those who do not contribute can file
a feature request but they have no right to decide. I have good
experience with zoom, terrible experience with MS Teams and Jitsi is
difficult, it happened several times that other users were not able to
connect.

Anyway, if you develop an alternative to zoom which will be equally
stable and available at reasonable price, I will probably switch to
it.

Remember that two years ago, work with New York State Attorney General 
Letitia James led to the launch of an inquiry into Zoom's privacy and
security practices, with Zoom continuing with its policy of not admitting
to any wrongdoing whatsoever.

I understand your point.  There would be benefits that would bring those
who currently refuse Zoom for them to speak or for them to listen to your 
meetings.  Still, many do contribute even though they do not get involved
in any such meetings.

The only people who would benefit from what I said in your community itself,
I do not gain much from it.  As you said, I have no rights or authority to
decide anything.  I leave the community to take the direction it wants.
You do it on your own and at your risk, and I will not be involved in it.  
In my community, you are welcome, but we do not use Zoom, that's all.

Thank you so very much
Kristof

Dear Community

This is about our online meetings. Since 2020 the online TeX Conference,
kindly organised by the TeX Users Group, has been widely recognized as a
good thing. I've certainly welcomed the opportunity to present and listen
to talks, and to watch and link to the video recordings afterwards. I thank
TUG and its volunteers for making this possible.

I have organised an online video meeting that brings together 3 past
speakers to the TeX Conference, on the theme of rethinking the role of TeX
in STEM subjects. I've made this a 2-hour meeting with presentations first
followed by small group workshop discussions. I think it is important that
we meet in small groups during the year, between the large TeX conferences
organised by TUG.

On Monday I sent an announcement of the TeX in STEM meeting to this list.
The response surprised and disappointed me.

Someone, I will mention no names, criticized the meeting in very strong
terms for using Zoom rather than an open source alternative. This is a
legitimate point of view. I contacted that person off-list inviting them to
discuss with me moving future such events to an open source platform. By
the way TUG has for 3 years used Zoom for its annual TeX Conference.

There then followed a mostly heated and often bad-tempered discussion of
video conferencing software and off-topic social and political issues.
There was no discussion at all of rethinking the role of TeX in STEM, in a
time when HTML rivals PDF even for technical material. [Not all of the
messages were sent to this list - see the PS.]

I kept out of that discussion. No-one seemed to notice that a thread
started for one purpose had been completely taken over by another purpose,
at best only peripherally related to TeX. This was detrimental to
discussion of topics presented by 3 speakers at TeX Conferences, including
this year's opening keynote Peter Williams.

It saddens me that this has happened. The health of your community requires
us as a group to discuss and understand present and future challenges, as
well as celebrate past successes. Details of the TeX in STEM meeting, which
happens tomorrow (Thursday), are at:
https://texhour.github.io/2022/09/29/rethink-tex-in-stem/

I do look forward to improved sharing of mathematical content in video
meetings. Surely we can do better than sending a video bitmap image of a
Beamer presentation.

wishing you happy TeXing

Jonathan

Subject: trouble installing a new MacTeX distribution
Message-ID: <CAGpwxLvEpgZDAbcDcZV8_OujWKBF=LtS9yf+w3W9rsxbpkXkMw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir or Madam:

I?ve downloaded and installed the 2022 distribution of MacTeX and ran the
installer, which said the installation was completed successfully, yet I
can?t seem to activate this distribution.

In System Preferences > TeX Distribution, I can only see the 2015, 2014 and
2008 versions.

I?m reading the ?READ_ME_FIRST? document, but so far I haven?t found a
solution to my problem. I?ve looked into the following:

I?ve navigated to /usr/local/texlive, and I can see folders for the three
distributions mentioned above, as well as 2009, 2021 and 2022. It indeed
seems everything was installed properly.

When I open Tex Live Utility (version 1.53), it tells me I?m using the 2015
TeX Live version and I should update to a newer version; it provides a
button labelled ?Upgrade? which takes me to the TUG website so I can
download one (which is what I?ve already done). Under the ?Actions? menu,
the ?Update All Packages? option is greyed out. Under the ?Configure? menu,
there is no ?Reconfigure Distributions...? option.

If it matters, this is all on an M1-Max MacBook Pro running macOS 12.5.

Thanks in advance. Regards.

The solution to this problem is very easy. The System Preferences module "TeX Distribution" is out of date and has been for many years. Ignore it. You have the distribution.

I don't understand why "TeX Live Utility" does not see the distribution. To debug this, please write me directly so we don't clutter the list.

Incidentally, TeX Live Utility has the ability to switch distributions, and that might solve your problem. In the program's Configure menu, choose "Change Default TeX Live Version." TLU utility should list all available distributions and allow you to pick the active one.

This will work unless the old Preference Pane damaged the data structure. Try this method. If it fails, please write me directly.

Subject: how to separate captions from figures, and put them at the end
Message-ID: <2313e698-c820-430e-bb8d-5bd2afb900d2@binghamton.edu>

I'm a statistician and do my analyses and academic writing with an R ->
Sweave -> pdflatex -> biblatex -> PDF worflow.

The journal to which I am submitting a uses an online manuscript
submission system (they seem ubiquitous nowadays) that seems to assume
submission of Microsoft Office files, although it does accept LaTeX
files . . . sort of . . . and then itself compiles them into a PDF. They
want gures and captions in this manner:

==================
Each Table and Figure should be removed from the manuscript file and
individually submitted as separate Table and Figure files and ordered
after the manuscript file.

Figure legends should be moved to the end of the manuscript file after
the references.
==================

I pretty much know how to do the first part with the endfloat package.
But how to accomplish the second part--stripping the legends (I'm
assuming "captions" here)--and printing them separately toward the end?

Thanks.
