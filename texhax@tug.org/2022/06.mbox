Subject: TeX Hour: 2 June: 6:30pm UK time: Setting up workstation with
 Distrobox
Message-ID: <CALD=Yf_01ev44Hv+=Ruf_CV55vuhq3VNwC7YdxQ9w0tfRx9GUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Sometimes I make or find the thing whose absence is blocking me. It's nice
when this happens. In tomorrow's TeX Hour I will share what I've learnt
about Distrobox, and how it will help me repackage TeX Live so that it can
be stored and distributed using git as a distributed content
addressable store. This is part of the foundation for Portable TeX
Documents (PTD).

Software tools for creating accessible documents have many components.
Reproducing this environment for others to use is hard work. Portable TeX
Documents will make it much easier and quicker to build the environment
needed to a source document.

TeX Hour: Thursday 2 June, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
UK Time Now: https://time.is/UK.

Here's the background. I've rebuilt my PC to have a 24-thread CPU, 64 GB of
memory and 1 TB of NVME storage. The new parts (including motherboard and
cooler) cost about ?1,000. It's an upgrade from a machine built about 10
years ago, and I hope it will also last about 10 years. I'm keen to do
large reproducible calculations, and to develop systems that work on
multiple platforms. Setting things up now will bring benefits later (and
soon, I hope). One is better understanding of the NVDA screen reader.

And here's why Distrobox. Yesterday in The Register I read:

If you routinely have to work with multiple different distros [...]
> DistroBox could save you a fair amount of time and effort. The tool is
> intended to simplify the creation and use of Linux system containers,
> making it easy to run one distro on top of another without the overhead of
> virtual machines.

Message-ID: <202206022138.252Lc0LF006824@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers,

One of the prized items in my collection is the program of the world
premiere of DEK's Fantasia Apocalyptica, his musical interpretation of
the Book of Revelation.  It was performed on the occasion of Knuth's
80th birthday at Studio Acusticum in Pite\aa, Sweden by Jan Overduin on
Wednesday, 10 January 2018.  The description of Fantasia Apocalyptica
can be found here:
https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fant.html.  The page
includes Knuth's musings, scores, and links to the audio and video
files.

One of the most popular images from the Book of Revelation is the four
horsemen in Chapter 6.  The interpretation of the first horseman is not
universally agreed upon, but many people associate him with
Pestilence.  The other three are named more explicitly: they are War,
Famine and Death.  It seems that since 2018 we have seen world
pestilence and a European war.  Experts worry about at least local
famines caused by this war and the consequent disruption of the export
of wheat.  Of course, these events increase the toll of death among
us.  While the scale of these calamities is relatively limited
compared to the end of world, each individual death is a universal
tragedy, and even the "limited" scale boggles the mind.

Knuth writes that the Book of Revelation is, in his opinion, "totally
mystical and spiritual rather than literal or prophetical. It probably
was written to provide an underground movement (early Christianity)
with some coded messages of hope."  The last part is very important.
Indeed the message we should extract from it and from the world is
hope.

One of the things that make me hopeful is that we continue to work and
create even in these hard times. I am happy to report that the
Polish TeX Group GUST after a long hiatus announces BachoTeX to be held
September 21--25, see https://gust.org.pl/bachotex/2022-en. At the last
BachoTeX in 2019 we helped a group of Ukrainian students to attend. I
hope we can do it again.

Speaking of conferences, the deadline for submissions to our flagship
meeting, TUG 2022, is close: June 15. Please do not forget to register
for the conference. I also strongly encourage you to submit a talk. As
in the two previous years, the conference is virtual and free. See all
the details at https://tug.org/tug2022/. Please note that this
conference will be accompanied by the Annual General Meeting of TUG.

Other important meetings are the DANTE meeting 2022,
Otto-von-Guericke-Universit\"at, Magdeburg, Germany, June 23-25,
https://www.dante.de/veranstaltungen/dante2022,
and the 16th ConTeXt Meeting,
Dreifelden, Germany, Sept. 12-18, 2022,
https://meeting.contextgarden.net/2022/.

In other news, TUGboat 43:1 has been mailed to current TUG members.
Among its papers are a discussion of the Markdown language, tutorials on
l3build and tikz-cd, a review of the long-expected second edition of a
LaTeX beginner's book by Stefan Kottwitz, and much more. Following our
policy, TUGboat issue 42:3 is now open for the general public (the
current issue is available for TUG members only).

Speaking of free journals, ACM has opened its journal archives for
1951--2000; see the discussion here:
https://associationsnow.com/2022/05/the-way-things-were-why-open-access-to-the-acm-digital-library-matters/.

New CTAN packages in May (https://ctan.org/pkg):
- beamerthemeamurmaple, a new modern beamer theme;
- chinesechess, typeset Chinese chess with l3draw;
- fixdif, macros for typesetting differential operators;
- mathsemantics, semantic math commands in LaTeX
- prettytok, prettyprint token lists;
- sidenotesplus, place referenced notes, alerts, figures and tables;
- simpleicons, simple icons for LaTeX;
- srbtiks, the STIX2 font for Serbian and Macedonian;
- symbats3, macros to use the Symbats3 dingbats fonts;

Subject: June LaTeX release: final call for testing
Message-ID: <202206022152.252LqjC5009018@freefriends.org>

The June 2022 release of LaTeX is going to show up in all major 
distributions during the next few days.  Because it was delayed a bit 
there is still time to do some further testing using

   pdflatex-dev, xelatex-dev, and/or lualatex-dev

in your current distribution, to help ensuring that everything works
well. If not, please submit a bug report. The tests so far showed that
all is well, but the more people have tested it beforehand the better,
as always. Thanks!

I got a bibtex entry for this url,

https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1097&context=physicspub

 with Toobib and with
Zotero (  using
http://api.crossref.org/works/10.1103/PhysRevA.24.183 since AFAICT
its webform does not work with pdf ),

and if you look at the PDF the title on their cover sheet has "2s12"
but then the paper has the likely accurate "2S_{1/2}" in
the title.

Note first it used  TooBib's  "handlediss" method to try to sort out the
awful way university libaries handle dissertations. But the title
entry looks messed up. This mml stuff in the title  is in the result from
crossref and apparently Zotero just drops it at least
on their webform. Is there some easy utility or c++
code to convert this stuff to latex? In the past, for unicode
and html I have just written brute force handlers for
common expressions or idioms and this looks a lot like
html and of course dropping it is an option too.

Thanks.

The conference will be held online July 22-24.

It would be great to receive more proposals, so if there's anything TeX-
or typography-related you'd like to give a talk on, don't hesitate to
send in a title & abstract. Presentations are usually around 30min, but
shorter or longer is fine.

We also greatly appreciate accompanying papers for the TUGboat
proceedings (deadline: July 31), but this is not a requirement.

Registration for the conference is free.

Subject: TeX Hour: 9 June: 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time: Learning Platforms - books
 to containers, Euclid to Katacoda
Message-ID: <CALD=Yf9G3p1YG1O+Fp4GQd8WyjVi4H0B2QOib8mSarLtbJhu4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

At tomorrow's TeX Hour we'll explore Learning Platforms. Many years ago,
even before the invention of the printing press in 1440, the book was a
prominent learning platform. Euclid's Elements consists of 13 books,
written about 300 BCE. A learning platform is a posh word for a library of
digital interactive books. Let's ensure they're accessible to the visually
impaired.

TeX Hour: Thursday 9 June, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
UK Time Now: https://time.is/UK.

Since the rise of cheap computing and the internet, the nature of learning
has changed. The covid pandemic has accelerated that change. Last week,
completely by chance, I discovered a new "Interactive Learning and Training
Platform for Software Engineers". It is https://katacoda.com/, and I
encourage you to explore it.

In late 2019 O'Reilly acquired katacoda.com because it was "a powerful
solution for developing critical tech skills for the 2.8 million members of
the O'Reilly learning platform". Last month O'Reilly announced that public
use of katacoda.com will end, and that the site will be shuttered on June
15 (a week from today).

Here's an analogy that arose at last week's TeX Hour on distrobox. The
printing press is expensive, but it makes each of multiple identical copies
of a book cheap. Before the press, each copy of a book was written out by
hand, and was expensive. There was a time when each server was
hand-crafted. With cloud computers and in particular the introduction of
containers (as in docker) each of multiple identical copies of a server is
cheap.

Here's the punchline. O'Reilly started in 1978 as technical writing
consultancy. From there it became the publisher of "Nutshell Handbooks" on
Unix. From 1988 publishing became the focus. In 2001 O'Reilly launched
Safari Books Online, a joint venture with Pearson Technology Group. In 2018
Safari was re-branded to O'Reilly Online Learning. And in 2019 they
acquired Katacoda, to provide a consistent interactive learning experience
to users of O'Reilly Online Learning.

I've signed up to katacoda.com as an author, and at tomorrow's TeX Hour to
start the discussion I'll share my experience.

At last week's TeX Hour Nelson Beebe and I had an energetic discussion on
containers (the interactive digital press of our time) and the distrobox /
toolbox interface provided for software developers. The video is available
at https://youtu.be/-Kro60y4Pmc.

Happy TeXing in the age of the interactive digital book

Dear Luis,

I would suspect that the problem has a LOT to do with the particular
machine (printer) you are using to print it. It is definitely making some
font substitution that is not called for. Would you kindly provide more
detail? it would be especially helpful to:

   - Know what this printer is and how you are sending the file to it.
   - Know a bit more about your TeX set up (TeXlive? Which version?
   Operating system?...)

and if you could also upload:

   - the first page of your TeX sources
   - the first-page of this PDF file

that would also be helpful.

My strong suspicion is that you probably do NOT have cm-super installed, so
the usage of

       \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

is triggering bitmaps fonts to be included in the PDF and this printer is
unable to deal with it.

This is just a guess, we will be able to check better with a bit more
detail.

Best,
Paulo Ney

Hi Luis,

Your TeX set-up is recent enough, it is 2 years old, but for this type of
files it should be completely okay, and your files are indeed completely
okay.

Your main problem is the printer and especially the way it is configured.
The set-up of this printer is fairly elaborate and someone must have set it
to substitute bitmapped fonts.

There are two path you may follow to solve this problem:

A- Work with the person that set the printer to fix it. It is a
horrendously expensive printer, I am pretty sure it is capable of printing
PDFs with bitmapped fonts.

or better

B- Change it to a better font-set, for example

      \usepackage{lmodern}

or something that will look even better. This should print fine everywhere.

Best,
Paulo Ney

My guess is a bug in the printer driver or the PostScript implementation
in the printer.

With or without the T1/fontenc, different sets of fonts are embedded.
Can you show the output of 
	pdffonts <PDF FILE>

In my case:

** with T1 fontenc**
PZAQTZ+SFRM2074                      Type 1            Custom           yes yes yes      8  0
THBJDT+SFRM1440                      Type 1            Custom           yes yes yes      9  0
FVYBMM+SFBX1728                      Type 1            Custom           yes yes yes     11  0
VCMVDW+SFRM1200                      Type 1            Custom           yes yes yes     13  0

** without T1 fontenc**
JJRFPZ+CMR17                         Type 1            Builtin          yes yes yes     12  0
AKYEZP+CMR12                         Type 1            Builtin          yes yes yes     13  0
MXCKHB+CMBX12                        Type 1            Builtin          yes yes yes     14  0

All the fonts have been tested and vetted on thousands of printers and
environments, so unless you have a broken font file, I assume a printer
driver error.

Best

Norbert

I was browsing the Zotero webforum, still nothing I have submitted
as a post or reply has been published lol, and
ran into this site that apparently creates xml descriptions
of citation formats. For example, 

https://editor.citationstyles.org/styleInfo/?styleId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zotero.org%2Fstyles%2Fapa


IS there some utility to translate this stuff into bibtex
or is that some other descrption language commonly used?
I was still playing around with generalized bibliographies,
adaptation to "bill of materials" and it seems languages
like this may be useful. 

I've noticed with TooBib many places are making it harder to
download webpages with wget and reliance on headless
chrome, I have made a utility called Chromate, seems important
now.  Any other automated tools running into problems? 
Still have not gotten the Zotero web form to work with any
pdf file however... 

Thanks.

What happens if you shorten the example so that it not longer uses
?C (and so no longer load sfrm1200.pfb)?

Thanks,
I guess the excerpt from your link  is pretty close, 
but AFAICT it sounds like you should be
able to generate a bst file from the CSL ? So I guess the specific
question still remains, " can you generate a bst file from the CSL?"

\begin{quote}

I'm the creator of CSL, which I originally created for very simple reasons:

While I used LaTeX, I work in a field which requires Word-compatible files; LaTeX not accepted.
I saw no reason why such styling needed to be tightly-coupled to the output format. So my prototype XSLT implementation had output drivers for LaTeX (bypassing BibTeX), HTML, and RTF, IIRC. I found that worked pretty well and so was a proof-of-concept (I used it to format my first book), and has since remained a priority.
One additional advantage of that output flexibility is a much larger potential user base for CSL styles, which in turn can lead to many more supported styles.

I have a lot of respect for biblatex though; it's a great solution if you can work exclusively in LaTeX.

But you probably want to use CSL if you need non-LaTeX output targets.

Thanks. I wrote my own c++ code to read the aux file along with the
bib files the target document searched and output a bbl file. I guess
in theory I could also parse a CSL file and impplement
arbitrary logic to generate a bbl file from at least part of
the CSL spec. I expected to need good flexibility for a 
bill-of-materials "bibliography" but have not gotten far on this yet.

Subject: CSL code to bibtex citations styles?

In practical it?s impossible to convert a CSL style to BibTeX (.bst) style.
The bst language doesn?t provide enough features to implement CSL?s
complex specifications. For example, there are no data types like list or
hash map so it?s difficult to disambiguate names as required by CSL.

If you want to use CSL with LaTeX, you may consider 
https://ctan.org/pkg/citation-style-language <https://ctan.org/pkg/citation-style-language>. I started this package not
long ago and some CSL features are not implemented yet.

In your case,
	supp-pdf.mkii
is not loaded, probably due to MPS to PDF converter stuff not present on
your. OTOH, on my systems

is not loaded.

I can. Since the newest latex release, color.sty loads mathcolor.ltx
for the \mathcolor command and this requires expl3.

You can avoid the error by giving \mathcolor a definition then the
loading of the file will be skipped:

\input eplain

\beginpackages
\def\mathcolor{}
\usepackage{color}
\endpackages
\long\def\red#1{{\color{red}#1}}
\red{ab}
\bye

You should I think be able to add


\ifx\mathcolor\@undefined
  % simplified version of \mathcolor
  \protected\def\mathcolor{\begingroup\@ifnextchar[\mlx at mathcolora
\mlx at mathcolorb}
  \long\def\mlx at mathcolora[#1]#2#3{\color[#1]{#2}#3\endgroup}
  \long\def\mlx at mathcolorb#1#2{\color{#1}#2\endgroup}
\fi

to the end of miniltx.ltx  If  that works for your real documents I'll
arrange an update at ctan

Thank you.
Actually, I found up that it is the update of the package graphics that 
broke the use of color, that was previously known to work with eplain. I 
reverted graphics to the previous version and color works again.

That may be OK on a personal installation if you don't use latex, but I
can't really recommend it. It's an untested and unsupportable configuration
and would break color and graphics support in latex

been sent to ctan so should appear in distributions in the next day or so.

btw, is XML really a good language to describe what amounts to
algorithms? Its good for a bunch of parameters and data but
adding logic sounds kind of odd. I guess LISP for windoh's users
was not an option although I guess an invented language, heck
even a stack based thing like postscript or FORTh ( or bst lol )
may have been better. Any comments on the culture behind this?
It may be a better topic for a flame war but always curious
why these things get adopted.

Thanks.

XSLT which is the standard xml transformation language is written using xml
syntax, and works very well.
Certainly proved a lot more popular than its immediate predecessor, dsssl
which used scheme lisp syntax.
I think the csl developer mentioned in that stackexchange post that initial
prototyping was done in xslt...

Subject: another Zoterro webform questionable result, 
Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB63384752D15A65EF8C25BDF4BEAD9@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>


I ran into this link this AM,

https://core.ac.uk/reader/74394360

it contains a link to the journal version but as a service to the reader
I'd like to get the bibtex from this link allowing it to be included
as a link to full text as the journal is behind a pay wall. And,
clicking through is a hassle while researching. The Zottero webform
returned the following, 

@article{goulis_vitamin_nodate,
	title = {Vitamin {D} during pregnancy: why observational studies suggest deficiency and interventional studies show no improvement in clinical outcomes? {A} narrative review},
	shorttitle = {Vitamin {D} during pregnancy},
	url = {https://core.ac.uk/reader/74394360},
	urldate = {2022-06-15},
	author = {Goulis, D. G.},
}


In general their output is quite terse whidh may be configurable in
the real product and may appeal to some users but it leaves out a
bunch of stuff and most warnings I've seen suggest erring on the
side of too much information- a noncluttered bibtex only
matters if you read it and if yo are reading it you probably want
as much info as possible. TooBib however found a lot more by
default ( and I confess to patching it to get the doi which was not
immediately isolated  but will be next time ). 
Note too that Zoterro did not get the author list right or
even indicate a DOI is available. If you had to manually
investigate, which is common, there is nothing to go on. 
If the webform is intended to promote the software to
users "on the fence" it really should be more informative
AFAICT. Running TooBib with "-all" returned a bibtex
entry with only one author matching Zoterro which apparently
was scraped from the thml instead of using the
embedded json info. FWIW.

Subject: TeX Hour: 16 June: 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time: From Alpine Linux to
 DocBook via AsciiDoc
Message-ID: <CALD=Yf8wrJRgD+TA6tkVOSN-4G+7KcEeGyaQY0LTrpnH+cxpCw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX hour is on a successful human interface to DocBook XML, as
used in practice.

Recently I revisited Alpine Linux (small, simple, secure and good in
containers) and discovered that it has new documentation pages. I liked the
pages and so wondered how they were created. They use AsciiDoc (new to me)
which is a human-readable document format, semantically equivalent to
DocBook (a long established XML markup language for technical
documentation).

This greatly interests me. There are many tools that can process DocBook
XML, which underlies the math accessibility project PreTeXt (which can
generate braille output). And AsciiDoc is being used by Alpine Linux who,
in my opinion, have very good taste in their choice and adoption of
technology. What I've learnt will be the subject of tomorrow's TeX Hour.

TeX Hour: Thursday 16 June, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
Zoom URL:

Last week's TeX Hour was Learning Platforms - books to containers, Euclid
to Katacoda.
Video is available at  https://youtu.be/n_Ew8Gol0TE.

Next week's TeX Hour (Thus 23 June) will be on PDF and typeset output in
the web browser. I used to collect stamps and I will start as a case study
with two high level stamp auction sites.

By the way, for security and other reasons from 1840 until about 1950
postage stamps were miniature masterpieces of design and printing (in other
words graphic typography), as on a larger scale were banknotes. Both are
part of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_printing. New security
measures include polymer printing and holograms. And bar-code readers in
postal systems allow users to print their own pre-paid postage labels, a
substitute for the postage stamp.

By the way, the Universal Postal Union, founded 1874 by the Treaty of Bern,
is the world's third oldest international organisation, and now part of the
United Nations.

wishing you well

I'd be happy to reply to these guys except they won't post my
threads or repsonses. This guy complains he can't cite a PDF  doc,

https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/97839/referencing-a-pdf#latest

the link is here for ref,

TooBib automtically mutates URL's when nothing else works and
appears to have found a solution. The Zoterro guru offers a link
which I did not hit since I have automated most of the process.
Again, happy to answer their question to help improve the product
but I seem to be blocked.  I can't believe they don't try url
mutation. It is a bit risky but manual curation is better than
nothing. And I'm doing pretty well right now. I did have to
patch my date extraction code though, still getting all the 
date mutants :)

Subject: from user reports on zotero forum, if "The Button" doesn't work
 users are stuck
Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB63384B116ED7A42DD7EA106DBEAC9@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>


I guess I'm still curious about any feedback authors have on the
approaches to getting bibtex entries. 

There are common posts on the zotero forum about this site or that
site does not work well. This is to be expected, TooBib
has problems too, but I'm not sure the users have much freedom
to look at all the ways to get a bibtex entry. AFAICT the
zotero design is a lot of "shiny objects" with all the trendy
features but not a robust way to get the bibtex. 
 TooBib is just designed to find the available bibtex entries
and may be useful for some zoterro users.  

Apparently zotero is written in or around node- I hated node  although
I'm using wscat as a temp way to talk to headless chrome :)
 TooBib is just
c++ code although a lot of the hard work is delegated to linux/cygwin
utilities for now and headless chrome is used for fetch where 
sites require it. Just from their online intro, it sounds like
they have a lot of dedicated "translators" and I'm not sure
it is designed to "hack" much lol. If anything I wish TooBib
could do more trials and rank results better but just taking
"all" or the first good one is mostly working.  

This is the most recent one I saw,

Hi,
I am Nur Asikin, a newbie. I would like to learn and use Latex.
I read that Texlive would be a good choice. I use windows 10 on a laptop.
As suggested, I install from the internet. I didn't expect it. It was a big
installation, more than 7gig and took 12 hours, installing/downloading
everything that I don't need. And there seem to be a problem, a failure or
incomplete installation (mirror from unpad.ac.id) as indicated in the log
below:

Installed on platform win32 at C:/texlive/2022]  >>

Later on, I thought that I might not have installed Texlive to be
functioning.
So, I enter the C:\texlive directory and run        *install-tl-windows.bat*
I direct it to install to  *C:\texlive2*, carry out advanced install {only
english and german, some graphics, (total expected to be about 5giga), and
choose mirror from singapore  (unpad seems to have a problem).
But, installation could not proceed!!  On display was the following:

[install-tl-windows.bat
Installing to: C:/texliv2/2022
Undefined subroutine &TeXLive::TLUtils::expand_tilde called at
C:/texlive/2022/install-tl line 1014, <STDIN> line 477.]

What did I do wrong? What should I do to install Texlive properly? Can I
use Texlive on Win10?
Thank you for your kind attention and help.

This would suggest that you have previously installed MikTeX.

Although I do not use Windows 10 myself (I prefer to stick with Windows 
7), I am /certain/ that if TeX Live could /not/ be installed on Windows 
10 we would have heard about this many times over.? As we have not, I 
think it safe to assume that TeX Live /can/ be installed on Windows 10.? 
Those more expert than I will have to address your "What did I do wrong ?".

Subject: adding a field to citation links, how would this work in bst or CSL?
Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB63386BFC3F32DDFBEB36F1ADBEAE9@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>



Trying to explore limits of biblio specific languages here. 

As I indicated in earlier email, I was playing around with the bibliography
entries to achieve two objectives. One was making a bill-of-materials
or similar list. A separate but related objective was to make
the links indicate the document of origin to allow crediting
the works more easily as click sources. The easiest way
to do the latter AFAICT is just add a latex command to the query
string and then it is "constant" for all documents that use the
citation as long as the command is defined in the document. In theory
this could just be done in the bibtex entry and as it may confuse
some servers there needs to be a way to avoid it selectively.

   \href {http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.120.020551?src_doc=\mjmbib}

I define a document specific "mjmbib" which you can find in the bbl
blocks below. Curious if this is easy in bst or CSL. 

Right now this tries to include every link in the bibtex entry
and duplicate detection is too literal :) I can eventually code
arbitrary link sorting in c++ but not sure how that works in a 
biblio specific thing without a lot of really idiosyncratic
features.

Hi

I've added the texlive list to the recipients. The original post is
https://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2022-June/025706.html.

@Nur: Thank you for your message. I hope you're not discouraged and will
soon get help with your problem.

@texlive-dev: It seems to be that the undefined 'expand_tilde' is an error
in the TeXLive install script. What do you think?

@texlive-dev: Please consider further checks before installation for
obstructions to installation. Nur's experience of "conflicting [pdf]tex
program" surely could be issued prior to installation.

when you get there, happy TeXing

Jonathan

You have installed MiKTeX system wide, and now try to install TeX Live
for the current user only. This does not work.

If you **really** want both installed, you need to run install-tl as
administrator.

But it seems that it has successfully installed on second try, so
nothing to worry.

That is **really** strange, and I am not really clear how that has
happened, in particular because your explanations are not clear what you
have actually done.

To give you a bit of context:
- the installer package you downloaded contains the newest code as in
  the repo, and in included TeXLive::TLUtils::expand_tilde
- what is actually installed contains a vetted and properly released
  version ot the TeX Live Perl utils, which does NOT at the moment
  contain TeXLive::TLUtils::expand_tilde
- You should NOT be able to MIX the two variants unless you do some
  really interesting invocations

> What did I do wrong? What should I do to install Texlive properly? Can I
> use Texlive on Win10?

Many things:
- You have MikTeX installed for all users (system-wide) and then tried
  to install TeX Live only for the current user
- reinstallation with "install-tl" are not supported, please use tlmgr

All the best

Norbert

Subject: contacting webmasters re bad citation info, use for TooBib vs Zotero?
Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB6338E795CA829321819A4F0DBEB19@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>


I found this comment on Zotero forum which is
quite a common problem in general with at least one citation source
being messed up, 


https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/97741/zotero-not-scraping-proquest-properly#latest


Zotero seems to only offer one approach per link AFAICT and users
are stuck as if they generate revenue from tech support :) Also note
this site seems to be at least partially a pay site, money no
assureance of quality :)


https://www.proquest.com/docview/2248552422/12335014?parentSessionId=zoAJxQkdJArShpajyaELc1t71zRp2wkllU4Qf%2B9idmg%3D&pq-origsite=primo&accountid=55036


I am not sure if Zotero supports this and TooBib did not originally,
except allowing an "admonish_webmaster" option in a request header lol,
but it would be nice to create informative output to 
explain to the web site WHY their citation info is messed up.
After a little dev on TooBib, I was able to get a passable
bibtex entry and the TooBib commentary could explain what TooBib
had to do to make it acceptable. In this case, there was plenty
of info in json format but obscured in a text/javascript entry.
And then the JSON was messed up with a useless key "author3," containing
a comma making the bibtex invalid. TooBib finally
came up with this but since they provide a "cite" button the user
seems to like maybe they are just pushing the pay feature
( I tried to hit their cite link andadd it to too bib but they
wanted to login )  lol,

	urldate = {2022-06-20},
}

which looks awfully sparse although maybe for a legal scholar it is sufficient.
The site provides a lot more information though and if you were going to
write a dedicated Zotero translator it may help to see how the information
is offered. TooBib maanged to find this, although again their "json" was
in a non-standard location. I had to do a relaxed search and then added
their quirky location to a default search.

Of course, you could probably eliminate the breadcrumb 
components but it is a lot easier to delete information
then go hunt for it and type it by hand. I should prbably eliminate
the futile commentary in this case re the author entry...  
Apparently the "date" command does interpret the decidedate
properly as milliseconds since epoch :) Quite nerdy for a legal
site :)

Subject: researchgate bibtex and Zotero, apparently no SOP for reacting to
 sites
Message-ID: <PH7PR11MB635616DAB73A37B327FE45DDBEB39@PH7PR11MB6356.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>

If they would let me post I would comment over on the Zotero
forum but getting citations is a larger issue for the 
author communities and espeically those recognizing that computers
may be able to automate data processing :)

A discussion on research gate, 

https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/37945/save-from-researchgate#latest

apparently they can not download when logged in. TooBib right now
is not using my login creds with headless chrome so I avoided that
problem but it does not sounds like the have strategies to deal
with exceptions from flippant let alone adversarial sites.
Writing dedicated translators may be sort of normal, and then
complaining that the site does not support their code normal
too- heck I've tried that and have an "admonish_webmaster" flag
lol. However, just for the developers you would think they would
have strategy output to share - my default dev output for this is about
20Meg which may be too large for production but easy to switch
on and off. 

It looks like my dedicated RG handler is failing, wget is now
being blocked, but the generic strategies that are more
paranoid and use headless chrome seem to be finding
ld+json which I'm not sure Zotero bothers to use as a rule.

Dear TeX hackers,

Do you see any chance to replace this working (!) example

    \newcount\countD \countD=0
    \ifpdftex \ifnum\pdfshellescape=1
      \countD=\input{|"countmodules \jobname.tex"} \fi\fi

(from pwebmactex in development: 
https://github.com/ascherer/web/blob/master/pwebmac.tex#L88 in 
conjunction with the shell script countmodules: 
https://github.com/ascherer/web/blob/master/countmodules)

with the desired compact version

    \newcount\countD \countD=0
    \ifpdftex \ifnum\pdfshellescape=1
      \countD=\input{|"grep \\\\:\\\\X \jobname.tex | wc -l"} \fi\fi

leaving out the external shell script?

Thanks in advance,
Andreas

Hello again,

>  ?? \ifpdftex \ifnum\pdfshellescape=1
>  ???? \countD=\input{|"grep \\\\:\\\\X \jobname.tex | wc -l"} \fi\fi

can be accomplished as such:

   \ifpdftex \ifnum\pdfshellescape=1 {\let\\=\BS
     \global\countD=\input{|grep -c -e '\\:\\X' \jobname.tex}} \fi\fi

Thanks to the '-c' option of 'grep' (tested with GNU grep on Linux and 
with BSD grep on macOS) we get rid of 'wc -l'. Thanks to '\BS' we get 
the backslash in the regular expression. In all, 'countmodules' can be 
flushed.

Case closed!

Is not your fundamental problem that \\, \\\\, etc., are not TeX escape 
sequences ?? If I were you, I would create a new TeX escape character 
(e.g., !), then re-catcode \ such that it does not require escaping.? 
Something along the lines of :

\newcount \countD
\countD = 0
\ifpdftex
 ??? \ifnum \pdfshellescape = 1
 ??? ??? \begingroup
 ??? ??? ??? \catcode `\! = \catcode `\\
 ??? ??? ??? \catcode `\\ = \catcode `\@
 ??? ??????? !global !countD = !input {|"grep \\\\:\\\\X !jobname.tex | 
wc -l"}
 ??? ??? \endgroup
 ??? \fi
\fi

E & OE, of course.

>From time to time I find sites that Zotero does better and
some sites just don't have the info there. I can usually
add to TooBib from existing tools, although not good
with books yet but apparently LOC has that service for
ISBN. I'm not sure how Zotero supports "translators"
or fallback strategies but after a while you get a set
of tools - macro's or maybe make a new language-
and there aren't many types although many quirks.

Hi

There won't be a TeX Hour tomorrow. The next TeX Hour will be on Thursday
30 June, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.

The TeX Users Group 2022 conference will be 22-24 July. It's an online
conference, free with donations welcome. There's about 35 presentations and
110 participants.
https://tug.org/tug2022/

Off topic: This afternoon I went to a local event to mark and celebrate
Empire Windrush Day. The organisers and community state and embody the
principle that "together we will make a difference". I like that.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windrush_Day
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61884535

Here's the earliest use I've found of "together we will make a difference."

Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB63389BFC2C62B48BA1273D94BEB49@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>

 I ran into another "fails" post,

https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/97682/error-when-saving-for-some-acm-dl-publications#latest

that mentions this link,

https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3428284

and I would be happy to reply and discuss there except nothing
I have posted has made it to the board...
Really I'm  not sure what the objection would be to some 
additional input on downloading citations as this is a common
problem that may have many resolutions. 
But, in any case,
without knowing what the OP is seeing, I did find
TooBib could return 6 candidates. The first two 
used the coi from the link and page text and appear
to return good results. The later ones scraped 
citation info from the html. I have noted
that Zotero appears to look for html metadata
first ( when it returns sparse bibtex it seems consistent
with meta scraping )  and ignores json or apparently doi
lookup. Probably the "professional" approach is
just to try to perfect one fragile translator per site without
a fall back to other strategies but I can only
speculate :)  Everyone is aware the html is not case in stone
and a search strategy would seem to be prudent especially in
this setting.

Subject: More flexible \multicolumn command?
Message-ID: <20220626163708.1b9d8cb8@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


I would like to be able to change, mid-table, the column specification
from e.g. llcl to e.g. cccc.

I can of course do this using \multicolumn, e.g.
\begin{tabular}{llcl}
a & aa & aaa & aaaa \\
a & aa & aaa & aaaa \\
\multicolumn{1}{c}{xxx} &
\multicolumn{1}{c}{xxx} &
\multicolumn{1}{c}{xxx} &
\multicolumn{1}{c}{xxx} \\
a & aa & aaa & aaaa
\end{tabular}
However this seems a bit kludgy and inelegant.  I would like to be able
to do something like:

\moreflexmc{4}{cccc}{xxx & xxx & xxx & xxx} \\

Are there any possibilities?

Thanks.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Hi, I'm Michele Durighello from N-E of Italy, using LaTeX from 2019. I like
using it, I know about Overleaf but I'd like you to create a minimal
multi-OS TeXlive distribution to put on a USB stick, it'd be great also for
users with no internet connect. & possibly with different OS over the 5
continents.
Wishing for this to be done as soon as possible.
Best regards, thanks a lot!
Michele

Hi Michele

Something similar to what you asked for existed in the past, and can exist
in the future.

I'm looking at my copy of the TeX Live 3 (1988) CD-ROM. It states that it
is a "Ready-to-run TeX system for Linux, Unix (DEC, HP, IBM, SGI, Sun),
Amiga and Win32 systems".

Being a CD-ROM, it will easily fit on a USB stick, and there's plenty of
room left for the Mac binaries (and Raspi).

I fully support your suggestion.

Hello:
I spoke with the technical service of the printer, they updated the
firmware and the problem has been solved.
Thanks

Guide:
- make udf file system
- install TL with --portable onto the udf file system
- write the udf file system to the USB stick
- try to get Windows and Mac to mount a udf usb stick

Enjoy

Could one put three partitions (FAT32 ?)  On your USB stick. Install TeX
for Windows on one, TeX for MAC on a second and use the third for
documents, etc? You might even install a MAC file system on one partition.
I have used Windows and Linux systems and have never used a MAC ?.

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour will be a general discussion on the themes of society,
computers and networks. All views on this are welcome. My personal interest
is continuing the good in the past and adopting what is good in the future.

TeX Hour: Thursday 30 June, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
UK Time Now: https://time.is/UK.

Next week's TeX Hour will be case studies on software documentation.
Examples include:

https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/index.html
https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/
https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/
https://docs.python.org/3/

By the way, X-windows turned 38 last week. Its replacement, called Wayland,
is now adopted by major Linux distributions, with compatibility with X.
This is a nice example of continuity and change.

Here's a link to the 1986 manual for V-system (a predecessor to X). It's a
paper manual scanned in as a PDF, with OCR providing search and copy. How
things have changed.

I still can't believe I can't find my CP/M manuals- IIRC they
were only a few pages thick and covered in maybe thick bright
construction paper :)

I guess if you are lacking in topics from time to time, 
I would like to suggest a few topics on LaTex and specifics
of documention creation. I have posted ad nauseum about 
relationships between dcouments as reflected in bibtex
and hopefully bomtex at some point. There are a lot of
issues with getting dcent bibtex from arbitrary links
not withstanding the existence of Zotero and TooBib
( any others people care to throw in ?) as many
sites seem almost adversarial toward people who want
to cite their works and I'm not even sure it is always
a business or revenue thing.  

There is another issue of using LaTex in less obvious
roles for "automated" PDF creation via computer
generated LaTex code. I'm not familiar with PDF
and LaTex and IIRC it was focused on DVI with 
converters to PS and at somepoint pdf.  
If I understood Bruno Lowagie's
story on iText, it was created in response to a lack

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IText

of good ways to make PDF files but yet LaTex
is there and would certainly work where speed is not
a factor. Due to the typeseeting issues, there may 
be some unpredictability for arbitrary data input however
and maybe this is easier to manage with iText or
other normal PDF related API's. However if you 
can use the geerated LaTex this may be an under appreciated
flow.

The other thing I keep bringing up is the "Latex syntax"
which I think in general is an excellent tradeoff
for human readability , at least at the top level in LaTex,
 of the source code compared to
something like  any {X,HT,...}ML. If there are appliations for this,
I'm like to see it in email, that may make a good discussion.


 I also curious about WYSIWYG work flows given speed
issues and multi-platform target destionations for readers.
How do these work out or do people make documents for 8-1/2 x 11 
and let the platforms worry about viewing?  
I like editing LaTex in vi :)


fwiw.
