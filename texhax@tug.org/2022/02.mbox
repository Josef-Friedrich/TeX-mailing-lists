Hi

Reminder: TeX Hour tonight, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

The topic will be Basics: The social, economic and technical context for
TeX: Past, present and future.

The past will start the release on 1 May 1840 of the Penny Black, the
world's first postage stamp. It was part of changes as revolutionary then
as email was in the 1970s. The bank note printer Perkins Bacon produced the
Penny Black, and they were sold at the Post Office. Today many of us pay
electronically for a barcode label which we print ourselves.

In modern language, each Penny Black was a fungible token, and the barcode
label a non-fungible token.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Black
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token

The future will conclude with two definitions.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography*: *Typography is the art and
technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and
appealing when displayed.

Me, last week: Modern Typography for the Blind is the art and technique of
audible, tactile and interaction conventions that make written language
legible, readable and appealing when rendered for a blind person.

Reminder: TeX Hour tonight, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time.
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Looking forward, next week the TeX Hour will be a case study of a paper on
"Accessibility of Command Line Interfaces" by Sampath, Merrick and Macvean
(all at Google, Seattle).

HTML & PDF: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445544
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b_dlMBUAw8

In part we will follow McLuhan, that
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message.

Of particular interest to LaTeX users is that some of the CLI examples are
inaccessible in PDF, and in HTML rendered as an image together with a
no-display paragraph giving a figure description.

Of interest to all is that screen shots seem to be the lingua franca
(bridge language) for sharing CLI interactions on a web page.

wishing you Happy TeXing

The typesetting algorithm is very close to the time-tested procedures designed by Knuth, but otherwise it's a different program. MathJax can also take as input MathML and AsciiMath, and the internal representation of formula is essentially a MathML tree. Also, MathML supports a few more constructs than TeX.

Hi OLiver,

Would you mind explaining that a bit better ? If possible with examples. I
am not sure I understand it.

   * Also, MathML supports a few more constructs than TeX*.

Message-ID: <202202040223.2142NhcL022713@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers,

February 1 is the Lunar New Year 2022, the most important date in the
traditional Chinese calendar.  I congratulate all TeXers who celebrate
it and wish us all a happy and fruitful Year of the Tiger.

While the life in many countries is slowly going back to normal, new
variants of virus sometimes shut down or severely limit theaters,
museums and libraries. This makes virtual museums especially important.
I have spent hours enjoying digital exhibitions, and would like to share
with you one of them: the Yale University Library has digitized their
copy of the Gutenberg Bible; take a look at:
  https://hdl.handle.net/10079/bibid/3391099

In other news, the TeX Live team has reissued the HTML version of the manual:
  https://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html
This version, thanks to the new features of tex4ht, is compliant with
accessibility guidelines. Therefore TeX Live is now fully compliant with
US and EU accessibility requirements, which is reflected in the updated
VPAT statement at https://ctan.org/pkg/tex-vpat.  And, by the way,
we encourage releasing updates to packages and programs before the
TeX Live pretest starts later this month (https://tug.org/texlive/).

The easy creation of accessible documents with TeX is an ongoing task.
While tex4ht helps to create accessible HTML, the efforts of the LaTeX3
team make the direct creation of accessible PDF come closer. For those
interested in reading, testing, or otherwise contributing, see
the PDF Accessibility TeXnical Working Group web page:
  https://tug.org/twg/accessibility/

Speaking of output formats, the LaTeXML project offers another way to
create accessible output.  Recently it announced a huge breakthrough
(https://twitter.com/dginev/status/1488157927001268231):
https://ar5iv.org.  It is a great preview site, automatically
converting arXiv preprints into HTML5 (just replace X with 5 in a url).
LaTeXML is available from:
  https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/
It is a difficult technical problem to include it in TeX Live, but
perhaps that will happen at some point.

On another front, we have started planning for the TUG'22 conference. It
will again be wholly online, and take place from July 22-24. More
details will be forthcoming, but early submissions are welcome; the
conference committee can be reached at tug2022 at tug.org. Nothing much on
the web yet, but updates will happen here (as usual):
  https://tug.org/tug2022/

TUGboat: the deadline for the next (regular) issue is March 31. Your
submissions on all things about TeX and typesetting are welcome. The
instructions for authors are available at
  https://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html

In TUG news, if your membership includes automatic renewal, it is
probably renewed by now.  If it is not, it is a good time to check
that you did not forget to renew. You can log in to the TUG members area
to check your current status:
  https://tug.org/members/
And you can renew at:

This year our membership forms use PayPal by default: it is faster and
less expensive for us. However, if you cannot or do not want to use
PayPal, the usual form we've used in the past is available at:

Subject: Toobib another case Zotero may not work and email interface
Message-ID: <DM6PR08MB55791F38E0481E3C9C00D8EDBE299@DM6PR08MB5579.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>



I'm trying to clean up Toobib to the point where it is safe to
make available by email. In some quick tests, it is nice
if you can wait minutes for the results and want a record
in email. I also realized that with the log file it is possible
to generate suggestions and commentary about other users as well as include
text ads :)

Right now, the handler reacts to "toobib toobib" in the subject
line and finds bibtex for each line in the message
body of the form,
toobib [clip,all] url
where "clip" returns the first reasonable bibtex
and "all" returns an entry from each candidate source
( and these can differ a lot ). Eventually an option
for high quality automated merge from the differne sources may exist.

But the reason I'm posting is to document another link that
fails on the Zotero webform,


https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Abstract/1974/02000/Effect_of_Pore_Size_on_Diffusion_Coefficients_in.2.aspx


Looking at my old bash script, the LWW handler used to look for a doi 
but this entry from 1974 does not have one. The html however
contains a bunch of entries that start "wkhealth_" using a motiff
similar to "citation_" entries. Once found it was easy to add
and maybe a prefix finder could be devised ( this is somewhere between
a bunch of hacks and AI lol ). 
I'm not sure how Zotero is organized but there are probably two
issues: robot exclusion and quirky biblio info. Headless chrome
in emulation mode probably gets around most detectors
that don't want to slow down humans. The quirks generally
fall into patterns that are easy to add once familiar with this
mess. 

Further, their "cite" button is limited to a specific rendering,
RIS , and EndNote or similar. This kind of junk is ideal for automation
or gasp standards gasp lol. 


Adding this, Toobib came up with,

I'm not interested in bashing Zotero, all of these are works in progress,
but if anyone knows competitors I'd be happy to look at those too.
A good product will benefit all writers and those exploring
bibliographies for various issues. I had a few problems
updating a ubiquitous class to handle expanded hierarchies
in html and json but I think the thing is ready to put up
for testing via email.  This may be best suited for anyone wanting
to review the links in an existing bibliogrphy although
since the debug build is running on my laptop it
may be a bit slow :) 

Lately I've run into a lot of places with "digitalcommons"
collections such as this link,

https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3467&context=etd

I was able to find the link in the pdf file and come up with this,

Zotero errored out on the pdf linke but 
if you find and click the link on the pdf cover page, Zotero does return
this which accurately reflects it as a phd these but otherwise is
a bit terse and the author name order is wrong. I have a name re-order
thing which did not handle the PhD thing right yet but easy to fix
and the formatting is ok for now.

	abstract = {Elderberry (Sambucus sp.) fruit is a healthful food with a variety of reported curative properties and is among the richest sources of anthocyanic pigmentation, which are the primary factors for its commercial use. Although a variety of value-added elderberry products are available to consumers, it is questionable as to which product form contains the highest nutrient levels and color stability characteristics, and represents the best value to consumers. It was the objectives of this research to evaluate a variety of commercial elderberry products, and to develop a value-added elderberry product with enhanced nutrient and color stability.
The first part of this research evaluated the nutrient and color stability of several value-added elderberry products (syrups, tinctures, concentrates, capsules, lozenges, dried fruit, powder) throughout 10 weeks of accelerated temperature (32? C) storage. Most of the products contained appreciable amounts of anthocyanins and other nutrients, which generally exceeded the values observed within raw elderberry fruit. However, the elderberry tinctures contained low levels of anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and sugars; high levels of moisture/alcohol, and displayed poor nutrient and color stability throughout storage. The elderberry syrups, capsules, and lozenges generally displayed favorable phytochemical and color stability characteristics. Kerr Elderberry Concentrate and NP Nutra? Elderberry P.E. 10:1 powder contained substantial amounts of phytochemicals and pigmentation, which demonstrates their value within wholesale food markets.
The second part of this research determined the nutrient and color stability effects of copigment additives (rosemary extract, tannic acid, black carrot color, purple sweet potato color, enzymatically modified isoquercitrin) within elderberry tinctures throughout 6 weeks storage at 21? C. The results did not demonstrate effective copigmentation among any of the tinctures with copigment additives, which was likely due to the high ethanol content of the tinctures. All of the copigment additives contributed to increased phenolic contents and antioxidant activity within the tinctures, and black carrot and purple sweet potato color additives caused significant (p?0.05) effects to the L*a*b* color values, monomeric anthocyanins, color density, and polymeric color of the tinctures. The results demonstrated that elderberry anthocyanins degraded into colorless products prior to converting into brown colored anthocyanin-tannin products throughout storage.},

I admit my statement was not very clear. The MathML description 
language, and its specification, largely draw inspiration from TeX. 
However the MathML specification describes a few mathematical elements 
that, in (La)TeX, would require to use a dedicated package. That is the 
case of some exotic things like detailed multiplication stacks or long 
divisions (https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/chapter3.html#presm.mult).
In fact, in TeX, even alignment environments (align, gather, etc.) are 
not primitive but provided by packages such as amsmath, whereas there is 
dedicated support for them in MathML.

That being said, it doesn?t mean that TeX is less powerful, since 
anything can be written in TeX. I simply used this as an argument to say 
that it stands to reason that the implementation of MathJax must be 
different from that of TeX, since it has to support a different set of 
primitive constructs.

I respectfully disagree.? Which is not to suggest that I believe that 
the implementation of MathJax is necessarily the same as that of TeX (I 
have no idea whether it is or not), merely that I challenge the 
assertions on which I believe your argument to is based.

For a start, why do you assert that "[MathJax] has to support a 
different set of primitive constructs" ?? Why must they be /primitive/ 
constructs ?? If MathJax were/is the same as that of TeX, then those 
constructs could be handled by a format file.

As to "the MathML specification describes a few mathematical elements 
that, in (La)TeX, would require to use a dedicated package", there would 
be no requirement for "a dedicated package" at all ? a competent (La)TeX 
programmer could write code to handle those elements without needing any 
extra package(s).

The defence rests.

Researchgate is a common place to find full text articles and their
support for bibtex is debatable. This link failed on the
Zotero webform and the pdf does not appear to contain
helpful information for computer aided citing, 

https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frederik-De-Wolff/publication/309726905_Acute_Ethanol_Intoxication/links/581f65c308ae12715af8eff4/Acute-Ethanol-Intoxication.pdf


However, Toobib contains a few ways to get at least some information.
Most of the time this is usable but RG also seems to create its own
DOI's and not tell crossref about them so those are not always
useful. This accurately determined it was a part of a book but
did not get the book info. This entry should be enough to use
and an interested reader could decide to  hit the link or otherwise follow up
based on the author, title, and year. Note also there was
a problem with the name prefix- I'm still tweaking the name
fixing code as this is annoying...  

Like some sites, they tend to change their html every so often. With
places that use standards, Toobib can eventually figure it out but
really quirky stuff requires domain specific code. Keeping the
code behind a server allows for better deployment of updates
like that. Although a patch push facility may help too :)

Message-ID: <tencent_4D533D53E10527DF097D94DFEA456AF66C08@qq.com>

Dear Sir/Madam,

I?m writing to ask how to uninstall the whole TeX Live 2021 when there is no uninst.bat file in installation directory.

I installed TeX Live 2021 via ISO image (double-clicking install-tl-windows.bat file) on Windows 10 today. Due to some reason, I want to uninstall the whole TeX Live 2021 and re-install it, but I couldn?t find the uninst.bat file in ?<texlive_root>\tlpkg\installer? directory.

Could you please tell me what to do to clean it all, so that I can re-install it with no extra concerns?

Best Regards,

Olivier

Under WIndows 7 (I do not use WIndows 10), Start / Control Panel /

Thanks for your reply, Philip.


Well, unfortunately I can't find TeX Live 2021 in control panel.


When installed it, I toggled "Portable setup" on installer, and that made options&nbsp;including "Adjust searchpath" and "Desktop integration" grey. I think this is the reason I didn't find TeX Live in control panel and environment PATH.


I'm wondering if an uninst.bat file from others could solve this problem?

Further, the names are mangled as the one with a "c" including a wierd descender
is hacked up even in the crossref output. I would blame by handling

Has anyone had a problem with crossref results and foreign chars? 

This is what I came up with, and you can see author_orig and "author" entries
after I triedo to concat "DelFava" as I thought it should be- is that not
right? Normally I ignore stuff like this as most users would but since
I was cleaning it up I thought I would try to make it more conventional :)

the c is c cedilla Unicode U+00E7 but it seems to have mangled all the
names.

Can you use the jats xml which has pretty much all the information you need
in machine readable form

https://d197for5662m48.cloudfront.net/documents/publicationstatus/38127/preprint_jats/ec977818c5c0ae0420e3501ce604b48e.xml

google suggests several existing jats to bibtex convertors eg

Thanks, I would not have clicked on the jats/xml link even if I had found it :)
I guess I can add that capability to look for jats now but it will take some
time and then I need to deal with the non-ASCII consistently. It looks
like most new stuff is going to json and dealing with xml conversions
may be a throw back but important to have... 

I take it "Del" does not concatenate with "Fava" in the native language :)
This is becoming an infinite time sink for little gain, I think I will mostly
leave the names alone but dealing with these odd chars may be important.

I also generally now have issues with chosing between some alternatives
for a first choice although when I return all of them there is usually
a good one in the first couple...

In general, you?ll find that most if not all text on the internet these days will be Unicode, and in particular UTF-8. Most modern toolchains handle it fine, what are you doing that you?re not getting the characters coming out correctly after processing?

I have not bothered to look into this as almost all of the stuff I care
about is ASCII.
I just brought this up since it seemed wrong coming from crossref.

A lot of the code calls linux command line utilities or some simple parsers
for html and json. While I have worked with these, I have not bothered
to look at anything beyond 7 bit ASCII and not sure how or if they handle
larger things.

My c++ code uses a lot of typedefed strings that I guess could be easily
set to use wide characters and I have a char class parser that is perfectly
general upto to at least int size chars probably. However, I still use 8 bit char
for characters in places, routinely test based on ASCII etc.

I'm not sure what would be involved in making this work uniformly
with larger char sizes... Although I have been pretty impressed 
at how easy it can be to convert floating point code to using
rationals with the gmp library and changing a few c++ typedefs :)

I must disagree as well Oliver, but for different reasons than Phillip.

First to see that MathJax *is* different from TeX you could browse the
sources. MathJax is Open Source:

      https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src/

It does use a few algorithms and techniques that are in the original TeX,
and it mimic the original display of formulas awfully close, but if you
build a display using the same fonts, and specially if you use
enlargements, you can see the differences.

Now to believe that TeX can't process MathML is just plain incorrect. It
may not be the best language to do so, but in order to use it you just need
the appropriate macro and package set

If you choose ConTeXt and the "mathml" module and you can process results
immediately, as seen here:

It does not appear to be a problem with my existing html parser so I can get
it into the internal common format ignore the xslt stuff I guess.
I'm generally trying to find ways to include miscellaneous stuff in the
bibtex so that unexpected additions are included and an interested user can
modify them as needed. If I happen to find them I can modify the code
as cases come up.


I don't know if the descending c thing will go in the email ok but the parser
had not problem , 

1 html 3 body 4 article 15 front 22 article-meta 30 contrib-group 46 contrib 51 name 52 surname 53 text = Gon?alves

Now I just need to scrape jats links as with bibtex or doi info. 

Thanks.

Thanks to you both for your input. I see now that my arguments to say 
that the two programs are different were by far not the simplest ones.

Also, I didn't know about processing of MathML in TeX! Thanks for the 
discovery.

UTF-8 uses 8-bit values exclusively, but, for non-ASCII characters they?ll be represented as multi-byte sequences. So, for example. ? (c-cedilla) is codepoint U+00C7 but in UTF-8 this will be two bytes: 0xC3 0xA7 (in some circumstances you may also encounter the semantically equivalent c + combining cedilla which will be c then U+0327 which is represented in UTF-8 as 0xCC 0xA7).

Pretty much any new code that deals with generalized inputs should assume that its input is UTF-8-encoded. UTF-8 has the advantage that for any multi-byte sequence, the starting byte can always be identified as such (so the classic interview problem of reverse this string can almost* be handled by determining whether a byte is a starting byte for a sequence or a continuation byte?the classic interview problem?s contrived nature begins to show itself in the 21st century).

Depending on the level of support you need, 
http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net <http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net/>
should suffice for your needs. I?m guessing though that the biggest problem you?re running into is that you?re likely running your code under Windows and haven?t done whatever is necessary to communicate to the OS that the program is outputting UTF-8 which might be all that?s necessary.

-dh

* The almost comes into play when you remember that Unicode allows for combining character sequences like the above-mentioned c+combining cedilla, not to mention oddities like some emojis which are generated by combining sequences like bear+ZWJ+snowflake = polar bear, flags which are (mostly) two-character sequences of regional indicator letters, etc.

lol, I'm right there now :) This is a big distraction for me, right now I just
wanted to accomodate the xml and that looks like it is coming together
as I have all the pieces. 
If you are interested however, 
the chars however are jumbled. For example,
"Gonzales" ( my english lol ), began ok afaict using printf,
( this just runs an html parser on the input xml and isolates the name )

 toobib -hhtml ref/jaxk.xml 2>/dev/null | grep Gon | sed -e 's/.*Go//'  | od -ax
0000000   n   C   '   a   l   v   e   s  nl
           c36e    61a7    766c    7365    000a
0000011
marchywka at happy:/home/documents/cpp/proj/toobib$ toobib -hhtml ref/jaxk.xml 2>/dev/null | grep Gon | sed -e 's/.*Go//'  
n?alves

But the output of "TooBib" the bibtex generator  ( or standalone c++ clas to be intergrated into
TooBib ), 


 echo load ref/jaxk.xml | ./a.out  2>&1  | grep "|Gon" | sed -e 's/.*Go//' | tail -n 1 
n??alves
marchywka at happy:/home/documents/cpp/proj/toobib$ echo load ref/jaxk.xml | ./a.out  2>&1  | grep "|Gon" | sed -e 's/.*Go//' | tail -n 1  | od -ax
0000000   n   C etx   B   '   a   l   v   e   s  nl
           c36e    c283    61a7    766c    7365    000a
0000013

As long as bibtex accepts it I'm just going to leave it there for now.

Thanks...

Subject: the "authorea.com" link and JATS XML in Toobib, 
Message-ID: <SN6PR08MB558222A0A41BDAE278DA5067BE2D9@SN6PR08MB5582.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>


So, a day later I seem to have a passable JATS XML parser and
a prefered handler for the authorea.com domain ( although I 
noticed the handler name is spelled oddly ... ). Toobib
found 6 strategies for getting the info although some
are a bit redundant but produced varied results depending 
on details such as html quality. Once fully integrated,
the JATS XML handler should be able to scan most html
for links that look like similar information and
use that as a source for bibtex entries. In this case, the 
xml link was just text processing on the original link
although that may not always work it can be added 
as a strategy- right now I may mutate things like "pdf" to
"abs" for example and that could now include "xml."
A sufficiently large collection of hacks is not distinguishable
from AI :) I also got a chance to read the article and
it may be worth all the effort to cite it :) 
I'm ending up with a header library of handlers most of which
can also be compiled standalone for testing.  I'll get
back to the character set and encoding stuff as it comes up
but the basics seem functional now. Thanks.

abstract = {This study aimed to describe an outbreak of abomasal bloat in kid goats and its clinical, pathological, microbiological, molecular, and epidemiological characteristics. In the kidding season, increased mortality of kid goats with a history of abdominal bloating, dullness, and death was reported. Clinical examinations were carried out, and biological samples from necropsied kids (n = 11) were collected for pathological, microbiological, and molecular diagnosis. Likewise, an epidemiological survey was carried out in order to verify possible associated factors related to the disorder. A therapeutic protocol was also implemented. The main necropsy findings were dehydration, pale mucosa, ascites, abomasal and intestinal meteorism and congestion, emphysematous abomasitis, and cranial areas of lung consolidation. Through staining techniques for cytological evaluations of the abomasum, it was possible to identify Gram positive bacteria, coccoid, with a cuboid shape suggestive of Clostridium ventriculi, Gram positive bacilli suggestive of Clostridium perfringens and ovoid basophilic yeasts compatible with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By anaerobic culture and molecular tests, C. ventriculi and C. perfringens type A were confirmed. The main histopathological findings were cholangiohepatitis, nephrosis, emphysematous abomasitis, hyalinization of the gastric and intestinal walls, gastroenteritis, intestinal thromboembolism, pulmonary edema, and non-purulent pneumonia, overall suggesting a systemic enterotoxemia picture. The early detection of sick kids and quick initiation of treatment were the primary determinants of the prognosis of each case. There was a final mortality rate of 24.4% (20/82), and the agents C. perfringens type A and C. ventriculi were identified as the main ones involved, with the possible participation of S. cerevisiae. Among the possible associated factors, the erroneous use of the milk replacer associated with inadequate kid management was verified. Among the prophylactic measures, hygiene care, proper use of milk replacer, vaccination plan containing C. perfringens alpha toxoid associated with a good colostrum management were suggested.},

abstract = {This study aimed to describe an outbreak of abomasal bloat in kid goats and its clinical, pathological, microbiological, molecular, and epidemiological characteristics. In the kidding season, increased mortality of kid goats with a history of abdominal bloating, dullness, and death was reported. Clinical examinations were carried out, and biological samples from necropsied kids (n = 11) were collected for pathological, microbiological, and molecular diagnosis. Likewise, an epidemiological survey was carried out in order to verify possible associated factors related to the disorder. A therapeutic protocol was also implemented. The main necropsy findings were dehydration, pale mucosa, ascites, abomasal and intestinal meteorism and congestion, emphysematous abomasitis, and cranial areas of lung consolidation. Through staining techniques for cytological evaluations of the abomasum, it was possible to identify Gram positive bacteria, coccoid, with a cuboid shape suggestive of Clostridium ventriculi, Gram positive bacilli suggestive of Clostridium perfringens and ovoid basophilic yeasts compatible with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By anaerobic culture and molecular tests, C. ventriculi and C. perfringens type A were confirmed. The main histopathological findings were cholangiohepatitis, nephrosis, emphysematous abomasitis, hyalinization of the gastric and intestinal walls, gastroenteritis, intestinal thromboembolism, pulmonary edema, and non-purulent pneumonia, overall suggesting a systemic enterotoxemia picture. The early detection of sick kids and quick initiation of treatment were the primary determinants of the prognosis of each case. There was a final mortality rate of 24.4% (20/82), and the agents C. perfringens type A and C. ventriculi were identified as the main ones involved, with the possible participation of S. cerevisiae. Among the possible associated factors, the erroneous use of the milk replacer associated with inadequate kid management was verified. Among the prophylactic measures, hygiene care, proper use of milk replacer, vaccination plan containing C. perfringens alpha toxoid associated with a good colostrum management were suggested.},

Thanks. I thought this was going to be another infinite time sink
but it turned out to resolve pretty easily. This may be a bit
off topic but relevant to dealing with almost-ASCII lol.   
It looks like I had two problems. The first was in the html parser
despite being invoked with the same encoding flag produced one output
from the c file input and a diferent one from the c++ ifstream. Changing
the encoding parameter to indicate UTF8 helped a lot. The second problem
though was this char-class parser I have that tries to break up 
a string into groups of chars of the same class - letters, digits, whatever.
This works well for a lot of ad hoc stuff although the logic afterward
may be a bit contorted its often easier than trying to make 
a custom parser. I have a bunch of included and user defined
bits for things like printable, alpha, upper case, etc.
 The UTF8
sequences were singled out as breaks in the groups of letters. I 
found for now it is easier just to piece them back together although
I could modify the char class parser thing ( or just check the high bit )
to note an "atomic" group... 
 
After all that, it mostly seems to work now and I'm playing with
the email server. I had to add a bunch of things to remove
all the debug output ( all of that is a macro but I just
left it in adding  a global var for gating it out at runtime ). 

Once I started looking at it though I thought about creating
a simple text "ad generator" lol. Creating customized ads on the
fly in the context of a user query and current events
is kind of interesting and there are a lot of real time news
feeds to use :) However I do have important stuff to do ...

Hi

Tonight's TeX Hour is based on the paper "Accessibility of Command Line
Interfaces" by Sampath, Merrick and Macvean (all at Google, Seattle). I'm
delighted that Alice Merrick will be joining us. You can read the paper and
watch a short presentation on it at:

HTML & PDF: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445544
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b_dlMBUAw8 # 5 minutes

The TeX hour is from 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time. The UK time now:
https://time.is/UK.
The zoom URL is
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

If you've time to read only one thing, look at the paper's recommendations,
which are:

1. Ensure that a HTML version of all documentation is available.
2. Provide a way to translate long outputs into another accessible format.
3. Document the output structure for each command.
4. Provide a way to translate tables in CLI output into another
accessible format.
5. Ensure that all commands provide status and progress indication.
6. Ensure that all status and progress indicators used are screen
reader friendly.
7. Ensure that error messages are understandable when read aloud.

Next week I'll focus on Community and Communication. In particular, I'll
explain why I think our community would benefit from a monthly newsletter,
and what I'm doing in response to that need.

Once again, Accessibility of Command Line Interfaces tonight, 6:30 to
7:30pm.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

I?ve been looking at getting a copy of the informal math fonts for my own documents.

Subject: getting bibtex from a url via email with Toobib
Message-ID: <DM6PR08MB5579186375FE4C8FDBA08628BE309@DM6PR08MB5579.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>



After the extensive comments here on Toobib and Zotero, I was
trying to make Toobib available via email using my existing
"mikemail" code ( probably similar to many other packages for
automating email stuff ). I ran into a lot of little things 
however, some of them relevant to bibtex and latex hackers
while others are not. In the process, I had to hack
up some code ( the little changes before deployment )
possibly creating gross errors I have mised so far. 
Many problems were easy to anticipate- leaking temp files
for example were great for debugging but
a quick disk killer in routine usage  - and not hard to fix 
but others came up. Dealing with email and simple
security issues has been enother thing. 

My current format is to accept email with "toobib toobib" exactly
as the subject and then parse lines of the form "toobib {clip|all|about} [url]"
and then return appropriate text in a response body with bibtex in
an attached file. While the utf-8 chars may still be flakey via email,
everything else seemd fine. 
So, I could send a plain text mesage body  like this, 

toobib clip file://asdfasdfasdf
toobib clip https://127.0.0.1
toobib clip adcascascascascasa eqrqwerew
toobib about
toobib clip https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.22541/au.159103680.00306295
toobib clip https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-020-02296-8
toobib all https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34978597/

and get a decent result as an attachment in a reply email. 
Worried that I had hard coded my return address, I tried
it from other accounts. 
Using my mom's cable
email account it looks impossible to get truly
"text/plain" as they apparently render the made up
html and call that "plain text",

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

which decodes to (WTF, every link is messed up and most are repeated junk  ):

After wasting almost all day on this garbage, I don't know
or care wth it is doing now... 


Note that it even inserted a "chtrmail.spectrum" in front of
my "file://" bad url in the links sectionlol. 
I don't see any amount of swearing or hacking that can fix
this now although I guess I could relax the syntax a bit to ignore
"[0-9]" and white space specifics.  

If you think you may be interested in using Toobib by email to
evaluate it or get bibtex from links for which alternatives do
not work, at some point hopefully you can send mesages to 
mjm_mailproc AT yahoo.com
with exactly "toobib toobib" in the subhect line. 
Lines in the body with no leading white space starting with
"toobib ' will be processed and acceptable commands will result
in a response whenever the server is running. For now, if you 
send in some
requests I can get some idea of the email format variability
and try to accomodate it.

I'm logging all the requests, both short form user and links,
as well as complete email. If you mail a message in a bad format
it likely won't work but I can try to fix it and replay it...


Thanks.

It went kaput. The web-site was alive till a few weeks ago:


https://web.archive.org/web/20211217191741/http://www.micropress-inc.com/

but seems gone now.

I am not sure what "informal fonts" are, but you can find the bitmaps
version of theirs fonts here:

     https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/micropress?lang=en

Michael Vulis seems to have stopped answering the emails on MicroPress a
long time ago. He is a Professor in the Computer Science department at City

Too bad.  The BA math fonts were really good, and done with the sort of
care it's hard to find elsewhere.

Hi Paulo,

It?s the font shown in figure 8.16 on page 523. It?s based on the Tekton font from Adobe. It would work well for the documents I?m producing at the moment. 

I imagine I could always make a font that would be suitably similar?

Kind Regards,
Keiran Harcombe

If one searches at CTAN for "Baskerville", there are at least two hits that
mention Math support:

 baskervillef ? Fry?s Baskerville look-alike, with math support

mathkit ? Generate maths fonts to match outline fonts, including Monotype
Baskerville

I guessed page 523 of The LaTeX Companion, 2nd edition.  And that is
exactly right.

Hi Agnieszka - the exact DVD image is not available as its own download,
but the individual components are all available on the net, as described
on https://tug.org/texcollection.

As for payment options if you want the DVD, either PayPal or a standard
credit/debit card is fine, via https://tug.org/store. If you need an
invoice or something else unusual, just email office at tug.org. --best, karl.

Is there some standard way to modify entries in a bib file so that the links
in a given pdf file are specific to that document? Normally when you open
a link in a pdf file there is nothing in the headers about the document
from which the click originated - no referrer header for example. 
However, this seems like it would be a good
thing to know for measuring the impact or conversion rate of a given work.

I'm playing with this now and wrote a bbl modifier that does what I want
but it seems like it would have occured to someone by now. For example,
this takes "oldrec.bbl" and creates "doh.bbl"  with the corresponding changes
in the pdf file after re-running pdflatex,

 diff doh.bbl oldrec.bbl | tail

All the links now have a document specific key-value pair in the query string
that can be tracked for academic or business purposes. It will not interfere
with most servers AFAICT but this program also opens the bib entries
and they can have entries specifying how the url is to be modified
or not modified. I think I'm going to start doing this in my build
script now once I determinte that it does not mess up the links
and I have a decent scheme that could be extended - a DOI would be
ok but a lot of documents won't have a DOI including many DIY 
projects or new articles. 

This would be easy to spoof but may still have uses. 




I never put the Toobib mail server up for long as my "Chromate" talks
to headless chrome on a fixed port number right now and it interferes
with development.  I fixed a few more issues while clearing out things
I wanted to cite from my browser tabs and it may be approaching 
"stable." Adding headless chrome in two mode- DOM and pdf- should
pick up a lot of sites that otherwise are difficult with wget. 
I think I may have fixed the utf-8 issues too :)

Another use case is to allow  authors to check all the
bibtex sources that can describe their works. 
If they can put all the links into one email and tell toobib
to get all the likely source ( google scholar is not supported
as that is typically very sparse ) it may be worth examining
for obvious errors. While retractions or other updates do 
not seem to occur uniformly, checking the bibliography prior
to submission may at some point be worthwhile.

 


Thanks.

Message-ID: <DM6PR08MB557902462C7B118CEE5489F1BE359@DM6PR08MB5579.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>



I recently changed my default builds from pdflatex to lualatex
and now the foreign chars are creating cryptic failure modes.
When I finally figured it out, neither of these suggestions
seemed to help.

https://www.latex-project.org/news/latex2e-news/ltnews26.pdf
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}

\usepackage{luaninputenc}

I finally just changed the odd things to nearest ASCII equivalents
although I guess there may be latex commands to typset the character
but that does not help for searching within the bibtex files
based on author names...


In vi they looked either normal or had the "<90>" syntax for
unknowns. I did not bother with od or looking at hex some other way.

I just wronte some code to write a bbl file based on the aux output
and the bib files. It seemed to work- I could get pdflatex to run
with the home brew bbl file and appropriately formatted
biblio entries but not sure if there are existing programs
for creating the bbl files. I do not know how to write
a bst file and thought this gives me more chances to fix problems
are they come up for bomtex or related specialtry formats.


Thanks.

Well it would help if you would mention the actual error (and would
show a concrete example)

Do not use fontenc (OT1 or T1) with lualatex. 
Do not use luainputenc.


Encode your files in utf8 or use pure ascii.

With a current latex this here should work out of the box with an
utf8 encoded file: 

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Gr??e
\end{document}


If you are using bibtex: be aware that it isn't utf8 aware and that
won't change if you use lualatex. It can't for example create
initials from names starting with cyrillic or accented chars. 
If you want to use lots of utf8 inside bib files use biblatex +
biber.

yes, I just thought this was a well known problem and it
had "A{n}" accepted solution...

I thought these were supposed to make lualatex act like pdflatex
which was my only immediate objective.

I was trying to avoid the issue but since everything seemed to work
I did not not worry about it. I have been changing my bibtex
downloader, TooBib, I guess i could have checked the download
dates of the offending entries but since it worked on pdflatex
I didn't think it was a factor. 

In essence I did make everything ASCII although I never took a

However, instead of converting offenders to latex I just picked
a close ASCII char.

Which it appears to do, see output at end. IIRC some of the chars were
showing up in vi as "<90>" but i can try to "od" them if I get more.
I guess the question is what happens if that is in a bibtex
entry...

AFAICT the only non-ASCII I had was in the bibtex entries so
I was surprised that lualatex mattered but I had to dig
into the log to find it choking on the bbl file. But the bbl
file worked with pdflatex.

Thanks, I seem to recall seeing something about biber and I can look
at those. But all of this was a distraction that came at a confusing
time because I wast just trying to verify a project was still intact
after I wrote out a custom bbl file from new code I wrote - so
I at first thoguth my new code corrupted the project or bib files :)
This is on top of non-ASCII already being a distraction but I think
I now accomodates this mostly. 

My new c++ bbl writer is just a skeleton to let me implement
arbitrary logic easily to cite less traditional sources in
arbitrary ways ( notably "bomtex" or a bill of materials ).
Do you knoww offhand if there is any facility or interest
regarding document specific modifications to citation
url's that identify the document responsible for the
click?

It does (more or less) choosing 7bit legacy fonts without even European
accented letters
so basically disables all luatex Unicode support, in which case you may as
well use pdflatex.

especially I would not use the version you used:

This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.80.0

there were many changes in luatex before the release of luatex version 1
(which has been stable for some years, the luatex team already working on
its successor) The current version has banner

This is LuaTeX, Version 1.13.2

I would have thought the main feature of a bibliography tool would be to
handle the names of people cited.
If you silently change names without warning, is that really usable other
than for testing?
How do you choose close ascii for Greek or Cyrillic or Chinese names? And
even for accented latin alphabet
you can't drop the accents without changing people's names, or introducing
errors into titles of papers?

In essence the citation AFAICT should give the reader some way to evaluate
important attributes of the source and decide on "hitting the link."
Personally I use the titles and maybe journal but sure a lot of people look at
authors. In that case, anything close should "ring a bell" for the ad hominem conscious :)
But yes I was very worried about search tools other than google that can auto-correct
or suggest. I'm not sure how you search for latex commands within names of if one is
better than the other. And if the link doesn't work the reader has the DOI...

And of course I don't like typos or inaccuracies in the bib files. So, everything I 
download with TooBib contains a "srcurl" to replay the bibtex discovery. This
allows  for detection of errors in prior download or prior versions on the source site.
If the original src webpage is no good ( some of these stupid sites have time limited
generated strings in the URL ) hopefully the overall bibtex entry is good
enough to find a better link either from a DOI or manual work.

See the above, certainly typos are bad but these should be easy to correct when it
matters and a reader who is familiar with an author can mentally figure it out.
AFAICT, greek and cyrillic transliterate well and I tend to ignore accents etc :)
Transliteration of Russian names has been a problem and you can see things
like -ov vs -off IIRC that vary with translator ( again IIRC, you are probably
more familiar with this and to me it is just a quirk or oddity ). 

I guess I will have to fix this for a variety of reasons although even for
a proof-of-concept for "bill of materials" tex it is not the immediate concern. 


Thanks.

I have been posting ad nauseum about "BomTex" and the related
idea of indicating the refering work in a bibliographic link
as links in papers othewise may not have a way to tell the 
server the source of the interest. There are several ways to
do that but without the document reader inserting a referrer
header, adding a query string or wrapping the url are possible
and both require the pdf generation ( in this case maybe bibtex
or biber or biblatex or equivlaents or things like the code
I wrote  ) to modify the citation links. Getting servers
to tabulate those is another issue but maybe doable if there is
anything to tabulate. For the time being, just getting the
DOI links to work would be a big plus and they already
have a central redirect or "wrapped" form, Namely

  https://dx.doi.org/[DOI]

making it easy for bibtex replacement ( my code :) )
to create citations with links like,


  https://dx.doi.org/[DOI]?source_doc=10.666/cool.marchywka.doc

Are there any facilities like this that would be commonly used 
by academic authors ? Eventually the idea is to
get commercial sites to check the query string to see where
customer traffic originates.

Thanks.

Well a tex system from 2015 and a latex from 2016 is not current.

Many things have changed in between, e.g. utf8 is now the default in
latex and latex properly supports the unicode engines.

Better don't use lualatex on such an old system, it still had
various problems at that time and you won't get any sensible
support.

 I try to just use whatever is in the ubuntu repo. IIRC, I had
to use it for some graphics thing- I think I was making a horizontal
bar I wanted to put into a table ( I had blood results that needed to
be shown against a reference range and graphics made sense - needed
better than ASCII art and did not want to write my own c++ to make images.
I ended up with lines like this, 
2021-03-24 & total protein & 7.8g/dl ( 5.2-8.2) & \mjmrange{5.2}{8.2}{7.8} \\

this uses tikzpicture although c++ generated stuff may have been easier.
Looking at that now the text and graphics should have been generated together :) 
)


I don't really need the latest version as I try to just write simple stuff...

These seem to be the bibtex choices,

apropos bibtex
Biber (3pm)          - main module for biber, a bibtex replacement for users ...

bibtex8 (1)          - 8-bit Big BibTeX version 0.99c


biber --version
biber version: 2.4

Although right now I'll probably keep developing the home brew component
to write bbl files - this will give me more flexibility in working
with entry types and filling in missing fields with alternatives
as well as making document specific links or other things.
 I guess this could be part of TooBib or I could call it "ForeBib"
 :)

Alas, with TL 2017 I'm also not up to date.

Just to be clear, I think you are just saying that
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} is now invoked automatically
rather than something more exciting.  And *without further
arrangements* the user will see in print whatever unicode
characters are handled in the T1 font encoding (therefore,
95 printable ASCII characters plus 128 T1 characters).
Do I have this correct?

And is it still correct that there is no access to open type
and truetype fonts without using LaTeX in a not-yet-default
engine?

Thanks.

No only that. You can use utf8 e.g. also in label names, so 
\label{gr??e} will work, and in file names too. And utf8 is written
correctly to external files.

What do you mean by a not-yet-default engine? If you want to use
lualatex or xelatex as default you only need to setup your editor
correctly.

Dear wonderful team
I have typed ?initexmf --edit-config-file xdvipdfmx? in my command prompt this opens up as a blank notepad.  I wanted to add ?=dNOSAFE? so that my xelatex would work with transparencies in pstricks, specifically pst-solides3d.

The version of MikTeX is

Hi

Tonight's TeX hour is from 6:30 to 7:30pm UK (and UTC) time. The UK time
now: https://time.is/UK.
The zoom URL is
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Last week I attended a "needs discovery" meeting organised by Daniele
Procida, who I've met several times at UK Python conferences. Daniele is
now one of several Directors of Engineering at Canonical, the  developers
of Ubuntu Linux, where he has special responsibility for improving both
documentation and the process by which it is created.

Daniele is also a current Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute.
The meeting last week was to discover needs for a workshop he's holding
next month, to help Research Software Engineers improve their
documentation. There were over 20 people there.

I hope that at tonight's TeX Hour we will share our experience of writing,
rendering and using technical documentation, particularly  for software.
Daniele's approach is focussed on a quadrant of user needs.

The quadrant is

Top left: Tutorials (focussed on learning).
Top right: How-to guides (focussed on tasks).
Bottom left:  Explanation (focussed on understanding).
Bottom right: Reference (focussed on information).

The up-down axis is practice and theory. The left-right axis is study and
work.

Interested? Reflect on your own documentation experience, and visit:

Subject: another PDF Zotero fails to scrape, 
Message-ID: <DM6PR08MB5579C5628BAB647930602317BE019@DM6PR08MB5579.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

I've seen a lot of universities with thesis collections
in formats similar to this,


https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1406&context=foodsciefacpub

but Zotero has a hard time with pdf at least on its web form. This pdf includes
a doi but you, or the computer, have to hunt for it. Often, they seem
to have links to a special collection of html that has machine scrapable
citions info. In any case, pddf scraping can be very important. I still
use wget but think I can use the headless chrome debug port to do file
downloads. Citeseer has been a problem as their bibtex is almost
empty and they are now rejecting wget downloads apparently. 

I've started to get TooBib to the "niceities" like UTF-8 and formating uniformity
but there are some blunders with innocuous changes to the 
cetnral design pieces ( going to an asynchronous fetch in headless
and generalizing the hierarchial doc format ). 

I've never looked at Zotero or competitors much but 
TooBib seems to work ok for me and certainly copared to the
Zotero web form. Hopefully I can get to the non-standrd biblio
entries for people and materials. It looks like adding document
specific query strings will not be a problem as that also lets
me write out the bbl file taking care of last minute
format changes. I'm not sure how to write a bst file to do it
but choosing among various fields and including multiple ones
with short text (" DOI" linkk for example like they do in IIRC
Nature ) was just easier to code in c++ than learning bst.  


Anyway, once you find the doi there is a lot of info there
from crossref,
