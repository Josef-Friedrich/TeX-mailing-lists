The deadline for the next TUGboat issue is in about two weeks, namely
October 15. We have a good amount of material, but would welcome
additional articles on any TeX- or typography-related topic.

They do not have to be deeply TeXnical or be research-level content --
indeed, introductions, tutorials, surveys, and other general-interest
articles are of special interest to us (and are rarely submitted).

I'm not ready to write up anything but looking for competing packages
to things I have been doing to decide on context of any later submissions.
I've talked about "TooBib" at great length and that effort provides two
basic functions: 1) discovering bibtex entries associated with a given 
URL, and 2) adding document specific query strings to URL's in a bibliography
to allow a server to identify the source of any interest when a reader clicks
on an item.  Zotero seems to be the popular approach for this kind of thing. 
TooBib is more focused on bibtex discovery and a simple command line interface.

I have also run into a lot of cases of trying to make Tex tables
from csv files. This sounds simple but getting all the details automated
may be involved. In my c++ code, I had been using a lot of "vector of vectors"
and created a sort of spread sheet with variable line lengths that I 
call a ragged table. So, I ended up writing some utilities to manipulate csv
files via these data structures and output them as tex tables. 
If I keep at it, I will probably have a command line version of Excel lol.
So, I started down a path that looks like I'm making a virtual machine
or op-code interpreter similar to dvi but for operations on 
spreadsheets :)  Curious if this general set of things relates
to anything someone may have done with existing stuff. 

Thanks.

Hi Mike - 

    make Tex tables from csv files.

The most complete package I know of in this area is Nicola Talbot's
datatool. It's for LaTeX. https://ctan.org/pkg/datatool

In general, Nicola has created a number of packages that solve
nontrivial problems in approximately complete ways, e.g., texlocale,
texosquery, bib2gls. https://ctan.org/author/talbot

FWIW ... --best, karl.

Thanks, at least one of those talks about a JAVA GUI to prepare input :)
I'm amazed at what you can do just writing in version of TeX but I like
c++ for data structures and familiarity. I guess instead of generating LaTex
from c++ I could learn how to do more in TeX programming
but then it is tied to TeX . Some of 
the charting Nicola describes  may be done in R although
not sure what the issues are. I have written my own svg generators
in c++ although I could get same result from R but I am just
used to c++ instead of R.

Hi Mike,
an alternative to C++ is Lua.  Scripting languages are more portable
than C++ because they don't have to be compiled for every platform to
be supported.  And Lua is already supported by TeX Live (luatex and
texlua).

Lua also supports data structures (called tables), see "TablesTutorial"
at

  http://lua-users.org/wiki

If you are already familiar with C++ you should be able to learn Lua
rather quickly.

Parsing CSV in tex is certainly less convenient than in any other
language.

It's also difficult to parse CSV because there is no formal
documentation.  In most cases the field separator is a semicolon
though the name "CSV" implies something different.  If you want to
process arbitrary files you have to determine the field separator
in advance, one way or another.  Even nastier are quoting rules.

There is no formal specification but you might want to read this
instead:

  https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt

IMO it's worthwhile to consider Lua because Lua scripts are supported
by all TeX distributions.

There is one thing worth to be mentioned: unlike Lua, luatex/texlua
provide a function string.explode() which is quite helpful when
parsing CSV files.  This is described in the LuaTeX manual:

  texdoc luatex

Regards,
  Reinhard

Generally I need to generate code that allows latex to actually
typset instead of having me guess by breaking tables at fixed
numner of lines etc. So doing more with Xetex or Lua is
probably the way to go. As you also point out though arbitrary
"csv" files, which I use to meean space delimited lol,
is a probably and that is why I do that in c++ as it is
just  a more familiar general purpose language.

In my ragged class ( a spreadsheet with ragged right or variable length
lines ) I ended up with a bunch of ad hoc parsers. One of these tries
to group chars based on class and when reading a text file it
becomes lines of string arrays with each string being delimited
by a change of char class- this good on words pretty often
and I can piece floats back together which tends to be
less effort than writing an accurate parser :) 

I also use "csv" files for name-value pairs per line. The name
is alphanumeric followed by a space and then unparsed text,
which may be sed or awk code, is read in from the rest of the line.

Dear TeXers,

Another month of this year has ended.  It is a really hard year, but it
seems that there might be the light at the end of the tunnel.   I hope
2023 will be much happier than the previous several years.

I have on my desk the latest issue of TUGboat (43:2) with the
Proceedings of TUG 2022 (the electronic version is available to
members at https://tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents43-2.html).  I
hope those who attended the talks will find there many interesting
details from the lectures we listened to - and those who did not will
have the opportunity to learn about this great event. Videos of all
talks are also available, perhaps most easily accessed from the
conference program page: https://tug.org/tug2022/program.html.

Looking ahead, we are conducting a short survey about TUG2023 - if you
have not yet filled out the form, we'd appreciate your input:
  https://forms.gle/yPmiXUS7Y2j8iwjq8

As usual, when a new TUGboat issue is published, the previous one
becomes freely available to the public. If you are not a member of TUG,
you may find many papers at
https://tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents43-1.html quite interesting.
You may also consider joining TUG and help us to produce TUGboat,
conduct TUG conferences, advocate for TeX and steer the development of TeX.

Speaking of TeX development, I'd like to remind everyone about the
grants from the Development Fund - you may want to apply at
https://tug.org/tc/devfund/. Besides supporting general development, we
have funds earmarked for accessibility work, so if your project is
related to accessibility, please note this in the description field.

The editors of TUGboat would like to remind the community that the
deadline for the next issue is October 15. Articles on any TeX- or
typography-related topic are welcome. They do not have to be deeply
TeXnical or be research-level content - indeed, introductions,
tutorials, surveys, and other general-interest articles are especially
welcome. Info about writing for TUGboat:
  https://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html

The IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, where our late colleague,
friend and TeXnician David Walden was a contributor and sometime member
of the Editorial Board, published a very interesting memoriam for him by
his long-time friend and colleague, Alexander A. McKenzie:
  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9842292

The current issue of TUGboat also has a shorter (TeX-focused) memoriam
for Dave, written by Karl Berry. It is available to all:
  https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb43-2/tb134walden-berry.pdf

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is "Safe TeX macros".

Sometime soon, I hope, we?ll be easily able to generate accessible HTML5
and tagged PDF from LaTeX documents. How to write our TeX source documents
and personal macros so that they?re ready for these important developments,
when they become available?

Date: Thursday 22 September, 6:30 to 7:30 BST (UK time).
Details: https://texhour.github.io/2022/10/05/safe-tex-macros/
Meeting URL: https://texhour.github.io/about/

Last week's meeting was good. Over a dozen of us lasted the whole 2 hours!
Here's the video evidence to prove it:

Message-ID: <183b6fab05d.f57de8fa229905.6575450839913741366@zoho.com>

In a discussion I had on TeX.StackExchange.com, another user pointed me to https://github.com/clerkma/yytex/tree/master/fonts/em, where the European Modern fonts, originally from Y&Y in the 1990s, are archived, together with a copyright notice saying ?Copyright 2007 TeX Users Group? and:



Blue Sky, Y&Y, and the AMS released the AMS and Computer Modern fonts
long ago under free software terms.  To whatever extent that Y&Y had any
remaining proprietary improvements in the fonts as they are included
here, they have been assigned to TUG, and TUG hereby releases them as
free software, under the one-sentence all-permissive license (to avoid
license compatibility problems):

??You may freely use, modify and/or distribute the material here.

Any complete fonts given here which have not previously been released
(I'm not sure if there are any) are also hereby released under that
all-permissive license.




This was of particular interest, since European Modern is an extension of the ?Blue Sky? default fonts that supports encodings other than OT1, and is superior in some ways to the cm-super fonts that are the default for the Cork encoding.



However, the only support package on CTAN for these fonts (psnfssx-em) is from 2001, and does not provide the fonts themselves. It is therefore only useful to someone who has an old copy of the files from Y&Y, which have not been sold in many years, nor are available with any yandytex package or distribution. Until yesterday, I was unaware of the git repository and had thought European Modern was not among the fonts Y&Y had donated when it went out of business.



Is there a reason the legal situation with these fonts might be more complicated than it appeared to be in 2007, or is the situation that anybody could have put together a European Modern package and submitted it to CTAN at any time in the past fifteen years, but no one ever did?

FYI, we originally released the Y&Y files at
  https://code.google.com/archive/p/yytex/
which was a favored repo site in 2007 :). Clerk copied them from there.
I presume the EM font files are identical, but haven't checked.

    not among the fonts Y&Y had donated when it went out of business.

FYI, nothing TeXnical that Y&Y had the rights to was held back from the
donation.  I.e., Y&Y gave us disk images of their development machine.
(Thanks again to Blenda Horn for doing this.)

    Is there a reason the legal situation with these fonts might be more
    complicated than it appeared to be in 2007, 

Not that I know of.

    or is the situation that anybody could have put together a European
    Modern package and submitted it to CTAN at any time in the past
    fifteen years, but no one ever did?

I believe that is the case, yes. --all the best, karl.

I'm not really knowledgeable about Computer Modern variants, but

https://ctan.org/pkg/ec

says that the European Modern fonts are available in (traced) Adobe Type 1
format, as part of the cm-super bundle.

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is "Generating accessible HTML".

I'll report on some accessibility investigations. A tool that writes simple
accessible tables and which is extensible would be an interesting
intermediate goal. Small enough to be practical, large enough to show
difficulties, and common enough to be important.

Perhaps such a tool already exists, and perhaps I can find it.

Date: Thursday 13 October, 6:30 to 7:30 BST (UK time).
Details: https://texhour.github.io/2022/10/13/generate-access-html/
Meeting URL: https://texhour.github.io/about/

Subject: anything particularly clever you can do with vector graphics like svg
 ? 
Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB63383A10809CDF37530FA042BE289@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>

I'm trying to put together a bunch of more or less raw data into a
single document but the graphics have detail at a lot of scales.
That is great in svg viewer but not pdf. I might be able to change
the graphics but limitations may be inherent in the amount of info :)

I am generating this svg from c++ so I can just as easily generate
latex code. Particular formats and packages that may be useful?

And I just ran into a case that Zotero did but not TooBib.
However, I've got a pretty good set of tools now so it
was quick to add :) 

Thanks.

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is "Same inputs via the XML Catalog".

 I will show work-in-progress that uses an XML Catalog and Resolver to
solve the problem (in XML) of ensuring identical inputs. The back-end which
stores the inputs will be a Git object store, and the internal names will
be Git object identifiers.

I want TeX to be able to use the same method. No change would be needed in
source documents and style files.

Date: Thursday 20 October, 6:30 to 7:30 BST (UK time).
Details: https://texhour.github.io/2022/10/20/same-inputs-via-xml-catalog/

Not on the TeXworks list, unless you are exceptionally lucky. Maybe try 
TeXhax.

Subject: does the Zotero webform still not do any pdf files?

I just ran across this and was curious if TooBib could
discover a bibtex entry, 

http://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/AA/00/00/49/56/00001/AA00004956.pdf

To my surprise, it did find the entry apparently with a dedicated UFl handler
but more to the point with a METS  source entry which IIRC someone here
helped me with. 
However, the  Zotero webform still choked on this,

Subject: another interesting Zotero failure/ a guide to reverse engineering (
 long day of rants ) 
Message-ID: <BL3PR11MB63385929C56CFD9D47111E5EBE2D9@BL3PR11MB6338.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>

This is kind of funny as a competition with Zotero but the effort put into
making the websites hard to cite and the 10x efforts trying to fix it is a huge
waste of time for everyone including probably a lot of authors and researchers.
But here is the latest one that I think gives me insight into how the Zotero webform
https://zbib.org/ works.

This looks simple enough, 

https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/25/4/432/73165/The-Anemia-of-Human-Riboflavin-Deficiency

but alas Zotero IIRC was returning a placeholder this AM and now a "no results" message.
I thought I had seen my headless chrome downloader fail a couple times lately 
and in fact it was failing here. "getOuterHTML" never returns and it may be more than
just an isolated site ( although I have an ancient version of chrome ).  
The coincidence of failures leads me to believe Zotero is using headless chrome
and a lazy implementation would explain their inability to do pdf files :) 
Despite my most
professional selection of curse words, I finally ended up with a terrible kluge but it
works for now. You would think instead of wasting time making cryptic sites forcing
people to spend even more time reverse engineering them just so they can get
accurate citations, they could come up with a way to derive a bibtex link from
a given descroption link or something. This is probably even dumber with Bomtex
trying to write works that lead to sales lol. 


I finally got this,

https://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10182/12132/Jose_Dilja_Masters_Dissertation.pdf?sequence=3

and it looked like headliess chrome failed bub it didn't matter because this fits
a pattern that TooBib was able to mutate into a useful url. A lot of dissertation
collections seem to use this organization. TooBib came up with the following
and this does not appear to have a DOI associated with it,

Dear Hugo,

the names for "de" are in latin9 which is not? a good idea nowadays ...

Subject: LaTeX for high school students? And writing LaTeX online?
Message-ID: <c77279de-8023-3c42-34a6-18f36dc10a98@binghamton.edu>

I've always thought it might be useful for students to learn something
of LaTeX in high school and arrive at college  able, to some extent, to
write papers and beamer slides in it. In contrast to some of them
learning it *in* college. No need to belabor the virtues of writing in
LaTeX here, obviously. So why not introduce interested or curious high
school students to it, especially (but not only) those who have some
inkling to pursue scientific/mathematical/technical fields?

I have this crazy idea to offer introductory LaTeX workshops to high
schools that are interested.  If nothing else, it might help keep me
busy after retirement.

As far as I know, at least in my area of the US, this is not currently
being done. Does anyone have any experience doing this? Is it a fool's
errand?

And are there websites where one can compose a complete LaTeX source
document and compile it, obtaining pdf output?  Many under-resources
schools in the US, where students are unlikely to have their own
computers at home, provide locked-down Chromebooks to all their
students. They are unable to install any software on them.

Appreciate any insights, experiences, opinions, or advice.

I've had high school students using latex and it went well.
We published a number of papers together.

Overleaf would be the obvious place to find a 'full fat' online LaTeX 
system: it's business model to allow people to work online. However, if 
you want something a bit lighter weight, at learnlatex.org we've set up 
in-page editing/running of demos but without any need to log in, etc., 
with the aim of supporting learning.

I'd not call that a crazy idea.

I did a bunch of workshops or courses with highshool students in 
Germany. Those groups were either aged 12?14 or 15+. With the younger 
ones I actually started doing some beamer presentations and made them 
present those within the group afterwards. Which turned out to work 
better than simple text documents.

The workshops have been either organized by the schools or by local 
hackerspaces and none was forced to do.

It worked quite well, but the learnings have been much better when the 
students really got encouraged to use it within some school projects 
afterwards. So I also started to involve other teachers in this. Which 
is a bit more complicated since most stick to MS Office. But wherever it 
was possible the teachers also started to be more interested in LaTeX 
themselves.

Additionally I started to add some small git introduction. (Just 
pull/commit/push) This was also catching some teachers who got used to 
filenames like ?x-finally_final.docx? ;-)

We either installed a TeX Live locally on the students' laptops, on the 
school's computers or created a local installation of the Overleaf 
Community Edition. Both worked quite well. I usually prefer a local 
installation to keep the students independent and they can also use it 
afterwards outside school.

The use of the community edition was mostly due to privacy concerns. So 
we needed to host it ourselves.

We also had the idea of making the students edit within a git server web 
IDE, this didn't work that well. They got mostly confused by the waiting 
time for the CI pipeline in the background. But was worth a try.

I hope this helps and would really love to see more highschool students 
workshops for LaTeX :)

Best,

Marei

"filenames like ?x-finally_final.docx? ;-)"  LOL. Yes, this! So true!  I
see it at work all the time too.

There has been some writing in cyberspace (on this forum, perhaps? I
can't remember) about how the younger folks have little understanding of
directory structure and "file discipline". They just throw anything
anywhere and rely on "Finder" (or equivalent). Perhaps enculturated
gradually by Google search.  But I digress.

Thanks for the insights about LaTeX in schools. Very helpful as I think
about things.

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is "Fun and games with Git and Fossil".

Git is the version control system developed by Linus Torvalds to host the
development of Linux. Famously, Torvalds says he developed only two pieces
of software and he named them both after themself. These items are Linux
and Git.

Fossil SCM deserves to be better known. Richard Hipp developed both SQLite
and Fossil (and named neither after himself). The one is ?SQL for the
browser? and the other an ?all-in-one? platform for version control, bug
tracking and wiki. Fossil hosts SQLite development.

In this TeX Hour I?ll show you some of the unusual things I?m doing with
Git (such as using it solely as an object store) and what I?ve discovered
between now and then about Fossil.

Date: Thursday 27 October, 6:30 to 7:30 BST (UK time).
Details: https://texhour.github.io/2022/10/27/fun-games-git-fossil/
Meeting URL: https://texhour.github.io/about/

I am working on a book and the publisher has sent me the prior edition's 
files.? I am trying to get the files to compile using latex from the 
texlive installation on my Mac but am running into trouble with how to 
deal with the fonts since they appear not to be where latex wants them 
or there are additional problems.

One folder from the publisher contains font files as follows:

HVB_____.PFB??? HV______.PFB??? ITC-OWBK.FNT??? MTEX.PFM MTMI.PFM??? 
MTMIB.PFM??? MTSYN.PFM??? OWBI____.PFM OWB_____.PFM??? Offici-B.fnt??? 
TIBI____.PFM??? TIB_____.PFM TII_____.PFM??? TIR_____.PFM??? 
ZD______.PFM??? timesbd.ttf
HVB_____.PFM??? HV______.PFM??? MTEX.PFB??? MTMI.PFB??? MTMIB.PFB 
MTSYN.PFB??? OWBI____.PFB??? OWB_____.PFB??? Offic-BI.fnt 
TIBI____.PFB??? TIB_____.PFB??? TII_____.PFB??? TIR_____.PFB 
ZD______.PFB??? times.ttf

and some of these appear to be loaded in the style files:

Kumba_symbols.tex:\font\rrmu=mtgu at 10pt
P04_Zienk.sty:\font\tmb=tib at 15pt
P04_Zienk.tex:\font\chapheadfont=TGB2 at 12pt%

P04_Zienk.tex:\font\itemheadfont=TGB at 10pt%
P04_Zienk.tex:\font\zapfont=ZD at 2.75pt%

P04_Zienk.tex:\font\titgr=hvmbi at 20pt
P04_Zienk.tex:\font\higr=hvmbi at 13pt

when I try to run latex it fails at the load of \font\tmb=tib as latex 
tries to run 'mktextfm tib' and then complains " I can't find file `tib' 
".? Any help on pointer on how to get things running (even minimally) 
would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Very hard to even get started with, Sanjay, especially without looking at
the files in more detail. Several of the fonts listed above are
proprietary, which makes it even harder to deal with.

Some of these font names remind me of the Y&Y TeX system of a few years
back. It would be nice to look at the original "log" file to find out where
it was processed in order to plan a structure to deal with. Installing the
fonts in a new system is very easy -- via XeTeX, and that may be a path to
solve this problem.

Ok, thanks.   Is there anything I can extract from the files to give better
hints to you?  Perhaps also there are some good questions that I can ask
the publisher about the files?

Producing an MWE (minimal working example) that shows the problem would be
nice, but this could be hard if you are starting from a "book" that has its
own style files, etc ...

Having a "complete" set of files, that is also including LOG-files is a
must. From the log-file we would be able to tell what system is it and
possibly how hard it would be to run it inside a modern TeXLive system.
Make sure you ask them for the complete-original set of files... even the
dates on these files can help finding out what is the system they run and
what will take to update it. It is a bit of forensics...

Another thing you can do, it to replace these fonts that are being
problematic, in this case

     TIB.PFB

with something trivial (and more modern, and available) just to make it
process, and then later replace it back with something that can really
replace it. I think the names TIR, TII, TIB, ... stand for Times-Roman,
Italic, Bold, Bold-Italic, etc ... so it won't be hard to find something
modern to replace it.

These names were used by ATM Fonts management and it is old tech and hard
to mimic in these days TeXLive.

The sources though should be good and very usable.

Thanks for the advice.? I started by replacing these fonts with ones 
that I thought matched to some degree the original intent, say, times, 
helvetica, etc.? However as I got into it, I realized that the style 
files were grabbing an untold number of hard to decipher fonts -- though 
google is pretty helpful.

I think I am going to go back to the publisher and ask them to run the 
compile of the book and send a zip of the complete run, log files and 
all.? At that point I can look in the log files and I can ask them 
details of their configuration.

Thanks for trying to help me out.

Yes, in general, the way style files are written they tend to be complete
and call for way more fonts then would end up being used in the book.

Asking for everything they have would be one of the best ways to proceed,
but be aware that if this is from Y&Y TeX, as I believe, chances are he may
not have much more.

If you want me to look at the files with you, give me a howl, I am in the
next building over (Evans)...though not today, next week.

Did you also get *.tfm and *.map files and perhaps *.vf files?

as the fonts are type1 fonts you can't use them directly with xetex.
You need the tfm and map files.

What I meant is, it would be easier to go after replacement fonts... and
install them for XeTeX.

Thanks!? Great to know there is an expert next door;? I guess that is 
the way it always works at Berkeley :)? Let's see what the publisher 
comes back with and then I will contact you.? I'm out of the office for 
the next 1+ weeks.

If the tfm and the other files are available it is much easier to
activate them then to switch the engine. 

You would have to indentify all the fonts and find replacements.
As they are calling the fonts via the primitive \font it is quite
unclear which encoding they use, and one of them seems to contain
symbols, so you need to check the tex source for \char and similar
and perhaps replace the values. Also you don't know how much must be
changed additionally to make the tex file compatible with an unicode
engine.

    Kumba_symbols.tex:\font\rrmu=mtgu at 10pt

Can't guess, but if you look at the source and output to see what
characters are typeset in it, and know what "Kumba symbols" are, you
might be able to.

    P04_Zienk.sty:\font\tmb=tib at 15pt
ptmb8y
(Times Bold)

    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\chapheadfont=TGB2 at 12pt%
    P04_Zienk.tex:%\font\chapfont=TGL at 22pt%
    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\authorfont=TGB at 14pt%
    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\affilfont=TGO at 10pt%
    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\tocfont=TGB at 8pt%
    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\itemheadfont=TGB at 10pt%

As with the Kumba case, If you look at the chapter headings, authors,
etc., you (or a font identification site) should be able to discern what
"TGB" is. I can't guess that one, but I bet is something commonly used.

For purposes of getting the doc through TeX, you could just replace them
with, say, Computer Modern, even though the actual font used is clearly
something else. (For example: TGB => cmbx10, TGO = cmsl10)

    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\zapfont=ZD at 2.75pt%
pzdr
(Zapf Dingbats)

    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\tabfootfont=HVO at 7.5pt%
phvro8y
(Helvetica Oblique)

    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\tabentriesfont=HV at 8.5pt%
phvr8y
(Helvetica)

    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\tabcolheadfont=HVB at 8.5pt%
phvb8y
(Helvetica Bold)

    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\tabcolheadsupfont=HVO at 5.7pt%
phvro8y

    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\tabcolsubheadfont=HVBO at 8.5pt%
phvbo8y
(Helvetica Bold Oblique)

    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\titgr=hvmbi at 20pt
    P04_Zienk.tex:\font\higr=hvmbi at 13pt
Also phvbo8y.

Needless to say, I'm just guessing, and the fonts concerned are
certainly not 100% identical to what was used in the book, and things
may break depending on the input encoding(s) used, nor are these
necessarily the best choices, etc., etc.

But, as I say, for purposes of getting the doc through TeX with some
rough idea of what's going on, maybe the above will help. --best, karl.

Thanks for the suggestions.? I will also look in the files and in the 
typeset book to see how things match up with the different fonts and 
that should give me a decent idea of what each font is supposed to look 
like.??? Most of your suggestions look reasonable from what I have been 
able to figure out.

Thanks for the suggestion.? Matching the latex files to the printed 
book.? TG* appear to be some variant of a SansSerif font, somewhat 
helvetica-like.

I misunderstood the meaning of trade gothic (thinking fraktur type 
letters) :/
You are correct, the font does indeed look like Trade Gothic in the book.

Hi Ulrike,
Thank you for responding to my question on the TUG help mailing list.? 
For some reason your response did not show up in my inbox, but I did 
manage to see it directly on the TUG mailing list archive.

To answer your question, the listing I provide shows all the font files 
that I received.? So there are not tfm or map files.

I appreciate your effort to help.? Once I get more information from the 
publisher, I will post an update.
