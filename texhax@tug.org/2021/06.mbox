Subject: Strange problem with centring headers in "p{wd}" columns in "tabular".
Message-ID: <20210602144542.40a641a7@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


I wanted to create a form with columns 2 through 5 all of width 2 cm.
I tried using "p{2cm}" as the "cols" specifier, and that worked
fine, but then I decided that I'd like to have the column headers
*centred* in the columns as well.

So I preceded each column header by "\centering".  This produces (in
my minimal reproducible example) an error:

> ! Misplaced \noalign.
> \hline ->\noalign 
>                   {\ifnum 0=`}\fi \hrule \@height \arrayrulewidth
> \futurelet... l.8           \centering Yak \\ \hline

("Yak" being the header of the last column).

I cannot parse this error message.

I then removed the "\centering" command that preceded "Yak" (but
left the other "\centering" commands as they were).  The *.tex file
then compiled just fine and the headings of columns 2, 3 and 4 were
duly centred, but the heading of the last column, "Yak", was of course
not centred.

Can anyone explain to me what is going on, and how (if it is indeed
possible) to get the headings of all of the "p{wd}" columns centred?

I have attached minimal reproducible examples; mre01.tex throws
the error shown above when I try to compile it; mre02.tex has
the "\centering" command preceding "Yak" removed, and compiles but does
not of course have the heading of the last column centred.

Thanks for any insights.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

It is collision between \centering and tabular. In tabular environment the \\
is redefined but \centering expects it's original definition, see, e.g.
https://texblog.net/latex-archive/floats/center-centering/

I would suggest to use array package and use it's \arraybackslash command.
Just use this line

  \centering Yak \arraybackslash \\ \hline

in the header.

After I added the change into mre01 I got result you may expect but then I
thought that first column of table a bit "visually unpleasant". I played a bit
with the example and came to this one (see attach file). It is a bit ugly but
cells material in first column is vertically centred.

As noted earlier by Vladimir Lomov, \centering is a bit incompatible with tables (although not because \centering expects the original value of \\, but because it does \let\\\@centercr which redefines \\ and messes up the definition). 

The non-package solution to this is to define
\NewDocumentCommand{\headercell}{ m } {%
  {\centering #1\par}%
}

then enclose each header with \headercell{?}. By enclosing the \centering in a group, we keep its redefinition of \\ from affecting the \\ at the end of the line (each cell of a tabular is implicitly in a group which means that if you had \centering in every cell but the last one, you would never have encountered an issue). We also put a \par at the end after #1 so that we end the paragraph inside the group and have the settings of \centering still in effect. If you take that out, you?ll see that your header doesn?t get centered as you?d expect.

If you want to allow paragraphs in your \headercell, you will need to change the m to +m in the argument specification, but that?s probably not necessary for your use case and is primarily useful for educational purposes to do something like:

\NewDocumentCommand{\headercell}{ +m } {%
  {\centering #1}% ? Note that I removed the \par here
}
\headercell{First paragraph which will be centered.

Second paragraph which won?t have centering applied.}

Message-ID: <202106022241.152MfsMe019333@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers,

I've just received my issue of TUGboat (42:1). Among interesting
materials in the issue is DEK's report of the 2021 TeX tuneup
accompanied by the description of the TeX entomology process by Karl
Berry, and (in the aptly named section ``Dreamboat'') a look backward by
Barbara Beeton about TeX design decisions that could (and maybe should)
be done differently. There are many other exciting papers, including an
illustrated interview with Amelia Hugill-Fontanel from RIT's Cary
Graphic Arts Collection, discussion of best practices in LaTeX document
commands creation, articles about fonts, macros, formats, and much more
- including a comic asking the important question, ``font or dog breed?''.

The next issue will be the proceedings of TUG2021 (August 5--8). Please do
not forget to register at https://tug.org/tug2021/, and please send in
your presentation proposals before June 24!

Speaking of conferences, the next ConTeXt meeting will take place in
Bassenge, Belgium, on September 20--25, 2021.  See
https://meeting.contextgarden.net/ for more details.  The deadline for
early bird registration discount is July 1.

June 1 was also the date of the 2021 Spring release of LaTeX, which shows 
a good number of enhancements and updates. See LaTeX News #33,
https://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/ltnews33.pdf
(or texdoc ltnews33 in TeX Live).

In other news, Nelson Beebe released a new bibliography with complete
coverage (1988--date) of Learned Publishing: Journal of the
Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers
(https://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/learnpubl.bib,
https://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/learnpubl.html).  At present
there are 2150 articles in the database.

New packages on CTAN in May
- bjfuthesis, a thesis class for Beijing Forestry University;
- bmstu-iu8, a class for writing reports at the IU8 department of IU
  faculty of BMSTU (Bauman Moscow State Technical University);
- codehigh, highlight code and demos with l3regex and lpeg;
- coffeestains, add coffee stains to documents;
- fontsetup-nonfree, a front-end to fontspec, for selected non-free fonts;
- pdfextra, extra PDF features for the OpTeX format;
- pgfmath-xfp, define pgfmath functions using xfp;
- projlib, a series of tools to simplify your workflow;
- tabularray, typeset tabulars and arrays with LaTeX3;
- tiscreen, mimic the screen of older Texas Instruments calculators.

Happy TeXing!

AFAICT, Zotero is consistently just providing skeleton bibtex from the news sites
but the few I checked from google news have a lot of cool info in the ld+json stuff.
For example,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/06/03/biden-infrastructure-tax-republicans/


@article{noauthor_biden_nodate,
	title = {Biden offers tax concession in infrastructure talks with key {Republican}},
	issn = {0190-8286},
	url = {https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/06/03/biden-infrastructure-tax-republicans/},
	abstract = {President Biden signaled at a private meeting on Wednesday that he would further narrow his infrastructure package to win Republican support, outlining a plan for about \$1 trillion in new spending financed through  tax reforms that would leave the top corporate rate intact.},
	language = {en-US},
	urldate = {2021-06-03},
	journal = {Washington Post},
}

But all the traditional things like author name are in an "application/ld+json" block and often
it includes things like video clips etc. I am right now just making skeleton bibtex and not
translating the fields but you can see that there is all kinds of useful stuff there,  largely
just in need of name translation,

I was originally doing this to get person profiles from linkedin and BillOfMaterials entries
from Amazon but both have had problems with naive headless chrome ( and I hate nodejs
for pupeteer lol ). But, if you write a lot of popular articles and want to cite news sources, that
should hit a big academic and political audience ( as if rambling political compositions are 
scarce  on the internet lol ). 

If you are talking to Zotero or want to look at alternatives or just want to scrap pages,
I think and open source collection of hacks like my TooBib has some place :)

I have also been working on a script, now a c++ program that invokes mostly bash utilities called TooBib , to generate a bibtex entry from just about any url ( right now this just works with journal articles and similar).

It seems that https://www.zotero.org/, via https://zbib.org/, already provides this or similar functionality (and much more besides).

For example I pasted https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12015 into https://zbib.org/. In Export I then chose Download BibTeX from the dropdown menu. This gave me

Would anyone shed some light why the MWE:

----
\documentclass{standalone}

\begin{document}
?wia?tek
\end{document}
----

would produce different outputs between pdfLaTeX, xeLaTeX and luaLaTeX?

pdflatex: It does not process and outputs an error.
xelatex: Process silently and replace the a-ogonek by an "a".
lualatex: Process silently and replace the a-ogonek by an "a"+ space.

Something to do with use of a-cedilla, perhaps ?? If repeated using 
a-ogonek, all works fine in XeLaTeX (I did not bother to try the other two).

pdflatex produces

! Package inputenc Error: Unicode character ? (U+0327)
(inputenc)                not set up for use with LaTeX.

as you have used the combining cedilla it;s hard, more or less impossible
to do anything with combining characters in pdftex.

luatex produces

Missing character: There is no ? (U+0327) in font
[lmroman10-regular]:+tlig;!

as latin modern doesn't have the combining cedilla either

xelatex gives the same warning.

I admit to be out of the loop, but does the newer LaTeX/LuaTex/pdftex/XeTeX
handle GPOS table in OpenType
fonts?  That might be a way around the issue, if those features exist.  But
I am not sure if there is an OpenType
font that would meet Paulo's needs.  There is always the STIX Fonts, but I
don't know if the vendor added a
GPOS table.

In xelatex if I use

\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{Latin Modern Roman}

and if I use either U+0105 (small 'a' with ogonek)
or if I use 'a' followed by U+0328 (the combining character
for ogonek) rather than U+0327, then it works.

Note: emacs balks if I try to use U+0327 as a combining
character with 'a' but merges 'a' with U+0328 properly.

Best,

Subject: how well known  o accepted is "json-ld" as a source of information
 for scraping bibtex from web pages? 
Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB5571197C58D9B1BAE1C231FABE369@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

AFAICT, this is a pretty common format for non-academic-publishers, 

https://json-ld.org/

It seems to be used on most news sites and I even found it on an academic reference site,
not a webpage of journal articles but a large diagram. For example,

https://string-db.org/network/9606.ENSP00000378426

in the Zotero web form gives this, 

@misc{noauthor_vkorc1_nodate-1,
	title = {{VKORC1} protein ({Human}) - {STRING} interaction network},
	url = {https://string-db.org/network/9606.ENSP00000378426},
	urldate = {2021-06-09},
}

But when I just naively make a bibtex entry from the ld+json data
it is quite rich and suggestive of extended bibtex usages like "BomTex"
for bill of materials or a biography short enough to be a bibliographic
entry for "private communication" based on say a LinkedIn profile, 
( I have modified the keys to just reformat the key hierarchy, not claiming
this is a good bibtex but could easily be re-keyed for custom apps ),

Maybe some people don't want cluttered bibtex or an entry type of "bio:protein" but
most of these things seem to be fixable with look up tables on literals or regexes.

FYI, the DVD was delivered in Colorado this afternoon.

Also FYI, there was reference to the newest TUGboat in a posting a week ago, 
but that has yet to show up here.

Hi

Tonight's TeX Hour is about code and math accessibility. I'd like to get
examples of accessibility being easy and hard, and to understand better
why.

The TeX Hour is today, Thursday 10 June, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time. The UK
time now is at https://time.is/UK. The zoom details are
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
Meeting ID: 785 5125 5396
Passcode: knuth

I'm interested in all reasons, including cultural, social, legal, technical
and economic. I hope that shared examples and understanding will help both
experts and beginners in this area.

Here's some top level suggestions:
1. There are legal requirements to provide accessibility.
2. Projects don't think early enough about accessibility.
3. Sighted developers don't get the blind user's experience.
4. There are mature standards, such as Nemeth Braille for mathematics.

Digging deeper we might say:
5. There's no STEM tools similar to https://wave.webaim.org/ for ordinary
web pages.

And deeper yet we might say:
6. Here are some good and not so good examples of an accessibility tree:
https://accessibleweb.com/question-answer/what-is-an-accessibility-tree-and-how-do-i-view-it/

Optimistically, I'm hoping this TeX Hour (really STEM Access Hour) will
collect and where necessary create useful resources. It's not enough to
provide the facts. Real world stories that relate to the reader are also
needed. Perhaps start with problems and questions, search for experts and
solutions, and then collect and curate the resources.

This is a general process. Being the TeX Hour, we have a special interest
and responsibility for matters such as LaTeX syntax, tagged PDF
capabilities, and navigation of mathematical content.

Interested? Please email me, or come along to the TeX Hour. I welcome your
experience and ideas. And I very much value questions from beginners.

The video from last week (Rethinking the beginner experience) is not yet on
YouTube.

with best regards

Jonathan

Subject: Are there other online bibtex getters besides Zotero? I found another
 case that may be a "pattern" 
Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB557180A2E158F23C7F613150BE329@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

If anyone know of other services I can check them too. This is great for  development.
Also, in at least one case I found a website was blocking headless chrome but took
wget with ua="Firefox" and Zotero failed on that site too. Presumably they are using a
self-identifying headless chrome. Its amazing that publishers make it hard to cite there
work but news sites will happily send full article text even if the browser puts up a paywall- I think
they get to count those as page views :) 

It may be important for some users to customize or edit or retain extra fields in their
bibtex and it looks like generally Zotero filters stuff out without notice. 

For some reason, theses can be hard. If you have the pdf open, most places I've found don't have links  or
embedded DOI's. Here is a case in point, 

https://bonndoc.ulb.uni-bonn.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.11811/8036/5508.pdf;jsessionid=8EE2D4C371DD10838C62271A1D5CEC0E?sequence=1

Zotero throws an error as did my code at first.  It turns out though you can mutate the url into
a useful one, 

https://bonndoc.ulb.uni-bonn.de/xmlui/handle/20.500.11811/8036

For this, Zotero gves the reasonable result, 

@article{liphardt_characterization_2019,
	title = {Characterization of {VKORC1L1} with respect to {VKORC1}},
	copyright = {In Copyright},
	url = {https://bonndoc.ulb.uni-bonn.de/xmlui/handle/20.500.11811/8036},
	abstract = {Vitamin K reduction is essential and catalyzed by two enzymes in vitro.

Inhibition of VKORC1 by oral anticoagulants (OACs) is clini-cally used in therapy and prevention of thrombosis.

My code will now automatically mutate it and pickup the other fields although it did not change note

I'm not quite sure this is what you want, but I have built a tcsh
script and pascal program (yes, ancient tools) that grabs Pubmed pages
and creates bibtex entries.  I use them all the time.  This covers all
medical and biological fields.

I brushed up this page a little just now; it may have some things out
of date.  Pascal can be compiled using Gnu Pascal, but not on macOS
anymore.  However, it can be converted to C and then compiled anywhere

I'm trying to get a single click that produces useful bibtex for
any webpage or local file or other things such as a doi.
Pubmed was relatively easy and Zotero seems to get a lot
of sites but only with limited bibtex fields. Even when bibtex
is there it may need editing and the Zotero web form does
not appear to give all options - it just returns a few 
fields. With the diversity of webpages you may wish to 
cite, I'm not sure how any product can really be kept up to date. 

Ultimately I want to extend the bibliography idea to include
short biographies for "personal communications" and a bill of materials
for works that specifiy things to buy to credit the work or author.
So, this exploratory work may be of more value to me than most 
people who want bibtex entries. There is a big problem with 
"junk" on social media and possibly making citations easier,
more than just copy a link or embed, may help as well as provide
some help with dead links later.  

Sure, I would like to escalate "TooBib" ( my product )
and it looks like an open source system may be needed just to 
keep up with the website changes. Also, having a huge collection
of hacks may be useful to website designers if they can see
what goes once they publish useful material :) 

This "systematic collection of hacks" may be a design pattern
too :) 

Thanks.

Hello!

Could you please check the crash in bibtexu.
This is BibTeXu: a UTF-8 Big BibTeX version 0.99d
Implementation:  C for Unix
Release version: 3.71 (04 mar 2019) (TeX Live 2021)
Compiled with:   ICU version 68.2

Please check the attachment with test files and log.
Previously. I used the version from the Debian repository, but it did work
with many items.
I installed the latest version, but it does not work at all.

Thank you in advance for the support.

I have zero experience of BibTeXu, and almost zero experience of BibTeX 
in general, so I tried the following :

> D:\TeX\Projects>bibtexu test.bib

I was told :

> I couldn't open file name `test.bib.aux'

Was this to be expected, and if so, how /should/ I have launched BibTeXu 
in order for it to (a) succeed, or (b) demonstrate your problem ?

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is about what would be nice to add to TeX Live. Your
suggestions are important. Next week's TeX Hour is about squeezing
everything into the 8GB available on the TeX Collection DVD.

When and where. Thursday 17 June, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time. The UK time now
is at https://time.is/UK. The zoom details are
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
Meeting ID: 785 5125 5396
Passcode: knuth

One of Don Knuth's goals in writing TeX was to give people software that
worked the same for everyone, across space and time. In the 1980's the TeX
Users Group contributed to this by distributing source code tapes (the best
medium at that time). Today TUG's support for the TeX Collection DVD and
the TeX Live distribution has a similar purpose.

This week and next TeX Live is the focus of the TeX Hour. TeX Live provides
a shared software experience for LaTeX to PDF. The focus this week is what
would be nice to have in TeX Live, for other outputs such as HTML and EPUB.
And for other inputs such as Markdown and XML transformed to LaTeX.

In case this seems a bit strange and off-topic, remember that Don Knuth's
WEB system of literate programs produces Pascal source and TeX source as
output, from a single WEB file. And tools such as bibtex produce LaTeX
source from content held in bibliographic databases.

The focus this week is on what's nice to have, in enlarging the shared TeX
Live experience to include outputs such as HTML and EPUB, and inputs such
as Markdown and XML. Today many authors and publishers want multiple media
outputs. And it's key for accessibility. And for integrating with modern
learning systems.

Next week the focus is on shrinking and simplifying the present TeX
Collection DVD, and making year-on-year change more manageable, without
significantly reducing the user experience. For the R-community, TinyTeX
shrinks TeX Live to 100MB.

Just tried this on two macOS systems (10.13.6, 10.15.7) with freshly updated TL?21.

In both cases, I get the same results that the OP reported.

How did you get the file ?test.aux??

Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB5571842AAAF6D034A7E1247BBE0D9@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

This is probably getting a little off topic for this list so if anyone can suggest another
one that would be great. But I'm still left wondering how people manage to 
create a bibliography now lol. 

Nature is now failing on Zotero,

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41429-021-00430-5.pdf

and as I mentioned before they used to return ris but appear to have abandoned that.
They appear however to have converted to the other more common approaches.
When I run my code and request all possibilities, I get 26 or which a few
are really valid ( I'm hacking up my code so this is expected right now ).
It appears they too have adopted ld+json. I have not seen any indication Zotero
makes use of this when it exists. 

So, I guess I would just comment Zotero does not seem immune from the problems
I was worried about and a development strategy to  deal with publisher
changes would be helpful. In my case, if the code was not hacked up, it
would have realized the nature domain things was failing and then try other
generic approaches ultimately returning something useful and diagnostic 
information. 

The "hacking" right now is due to a more accurate hierarchial parsing system.
The html is so dirty that I have found at least one case that sed and grep worked
where a real parser failed but in most cases the real parser will be more robust
and some pieces work well with json and html trees. 

It may be however that ld+json is getting pretty uniform acceptance and that
may be the solution for a long time.

Thanks.

If anyone is interested, just to complete this investigation and motivate anyone interested in further
research into bibtex aids for authors, I took out some of the hacks in my code to produce the possible
bibtex entries associated with the link 

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41429-021-00430-5.pdf

for which the Zotero web form still returns a failure message.

My code "TooBib" run with the link on the clipboard,

 echo -e "clip xxxx all" | ../toobib.out -legacy   2> aaaa

Returned 18 bibtex entries from different strategies ( the "all" modifier to the "clip" command 
has it return everything ). Since I label all my hits with information for later analysis of the
method ( and even re-fetch if better info exists ) , I can look at the search strategies.
In this case, the original guess to use the nature domain method worked 
as did the generic mutate strategy to try a related url ( which is not surprising
since the nature handler just does that lol ). These are redundant but that
is useful for development,   ( guessnature is a dedicated handler for a url with the nature domain,
the other handlers are generic and use things implied by their name such as meta data, doi,
or ldjson entries ), 

 cat xxxx | grep mjmhandler
% mjmhandler: toobib guessnature<-handledoi
% mjmhandler: toobib guessnature<-handledoixml
% mjmhandler: toobib guessnature<-handlegsmeta(html)
% mjmhandler: toobib guessnature<-handlegsmeta(scraper)
% mjmhandler: toobib guessnature<-handleldjson2
% mjmhandler: toobib guessnature<-handleadhochtml<-citation
% mjmhandler: toobib guessnature<-handleadhochtml<-DC
% mjmhandler: toobib guessnature<-handleadhochtml<-og
% mjmhandler: toobib handledoi
% mjmhandler: toobib handlepdf (pdftotext)
% mjmhandler: toobib handlemutate<-handledoi
% mjmhandler: toobib handlemutate<-handledoixml
% mjmhandler: toobib handlemutate<-handlegsmeta(html)

% mjmhandler: toobib handlemutate<-handleadhochtml<-citation
% mjmhandler: toobib handlemutate<-handleadhochtml<-DC
% mjmhandler: toobib handlemutate<-handleadhochtml<-og


The "citation" entry is just fine but the ldjson2 continues to
provide additional useful information.

Subject: Bad (or good) interaction between XeLaTeX and Dropbox
Message-ID: <CAFVhNZNm3d+2zRQ1zQh4v1t-q2V7zrAEX+fSSBUOKsHY==ze=w@mail.gmail.com>

These days I edit most of my files inside Dropbox, due to cooperation with
other authors.

Every once in a while I meet an error using xelatex which is:

(./main.out) (./main.out) (./main.toc) [1
! I can't write on file `main.pdf'.
(Press Enter to retry, or Control-D to exit; default file extension is
`.pdf')
Please type another file name for output:


and it would just refuse to overwrite (or even write) main.pdf inside the
directory,
no matter what one does, even removing the file entirely.

It does not have anything to do with the TeX source file, I can -- at that
point -- change
to a simple one-liner and xelatex would NOT write the main.pdf file to the
disk. Once
it happens it persists for hours in that particular directory.

Moving the file OUT of Dropbox or changing to either pdfLaTeX or luaLaTeX
solves the problem.

Has anyone seen this? What sort of interaction xeLaTeX have with the file
system that is not performed by pdflatex or lualatex?

I don't know the answer, but I imagine it is highly dependent on your operating system. Which one is it?

Subject: non-article bibtex, and interesting example from Zotero and TooBib
Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB5571A29BE18DFC7CDE7D5566BE0A9@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

I had been ignoring non-articles for a while and coercing anything close into an article type.
However, as I start to clean up the code and look for things like person entries and "bill of materials"  entries,
I startred looking at other things.  Some controversy and diversity exists on these things but it also brings
up the point of citation-specific bibtex modification as you may want to cite a specific page or something ( and
in my case I add comments or fields for download mechanism and enough info to re-fetch in case of
latent bug or maybe to check for retractions ). 

This came up on a search and appears to reference a book chapter,

https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781315154831-9/nadph-oxidases-reactive-oxygen-viral-infections-emphasis-influenza-shivaprakash-gangappa-amelia-hofstetter-becky-diebold-david-lambeth-margreet-vissers-mark-hampton-anthony-kettle


Zotero gives this from the webform,

@book{noauthor_nadph_2017,
	title = {Nadph oxidases and reactive oxygen in viral infections, with emphasis on influenza},
	isbn = {9781315154831},
	url = {https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781315154831-9/nadph-oxidases-reactive-oxygen-viral-infections-emphasis-influenza-shivaprakash-gangappa-amelia-hofstetter-becky-diebold-david-lambeth-margreet-vissers-mark-hampton-anthony-kettle},
	abstract = {This chapter discusses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) Oxidases and Reactive Oxygen in Viral Infections, with Emphasis on Influenza.},
	language = {en},
	urldate = {2021-06-21},
	publisher = {CRC Press},
	month = oct,
	year = {2017},
	doi = {10.1201/9781315154831-9},
}

But the page self-identifies in a number of ways ( incidentally, I just found even researchgate now includes kd+json lol ). 

On this page, I get  7 candidates although not all that unique. However, none of them is a book
although if you look at the fields book does come up,

There are cases where my scraping code returns spurious results ( wrong DOI for example )
but usually there is enough stuff to sort it out even without looking back at the webpage.
Here, you could even imagine just combining all the results except it may be hard
to resolve conflicts.

I get that from time to time. It is nearly always when an author leaves a file open on one machine, then moves to another to open the file again from somewhere else.

Hi

Video from last week's TeX Hour (enlarge TeX Live to improve user
experience) is available at
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1FZfIX1w7hwBDqZoii3eOtd-RMivznf

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is hard technical stuff unlikely to interest most
users. The basic idea is to use git as the basis for future CTAN and TeX
Live. To read more visit the TeX Live list:
https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2021-June/047161.html

Details of tomorrow's TeX Hour. Thursday 17 June, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time.
The UK time now is at https://time.is/UK. The zoom details are

Subject: Is there anyway to add a referer header to a clickable url in a Tex , 
 or for that matter any pdf , document? 
Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB557172378E00CBBAB14E8C93BE089@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

I didn't find anything immediately and a search for "header" is confusing and quoted "request header" did not
work. I tried to explain this here but without luck so far, 

https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/602441/how-can-i-add-request-headers-such-as-referer-to-a-link-embedded-in-a-document'

This seems like an obvious way to track the impact of a publication with the referer header containing a document id like
a doi. This is good for impact assessment or even royalties lol. Alternatively,  I can put a document specific key value
pair in the query string if the server can do anything with it.  But this also means modifying all the individual url's
including the bibliography ( or "BomTex" bill of materials lol ).

Thanks.

BTW, as I start looking at BomTex, and try to extract info from commercial product pages, I was just as this page
below and got a bunch of info although not sure if this is a standard pattern or just odd. Getting back
to Amazon later which should cover a lot, 

https://www.ledsupply.com/accessories/aluminum-turn-knob

its kind of crazy how they use meta data but "the truth is in there" and it looks like for many items I can
make a decent "bibliographic entry" suitable for a "bill of materials" or similar.

The latest issue of Communications of the ACM (July 2021) carries an
obituary for Adobe co-founder Chuck Geschke:

        https://doi.org/10.1145/3467481

The PDF is freely accessible.

Adobe technologies, especially PostScript and PDF, and font designs
and font file formats, have had an enormous impact on the world,
and the TeX community.

Hi

Here's a message. Developers are not the same as users. If you're a
developer then people don't want to USE your software. Period. People might
want to HAVE USED your software.

Most people don't want to use a word processor. They want to write a letter
or a report or something else. They don't want to drive a car. They want to
be somewhere else, a friend's house, the shops, the hospital or somewhere
else.

David Platt explains this very well in his 2 minute video! Please watch and
listen.
Why Software Sucks: Geeks Drive Stick Shift Cars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAOTTLQ0rlY&ab_channel=techrant

Details of tomorrow's TeX Hour. Thursday 1 July, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time.
The UK time now is at https://time.is/UK. The zoom details are
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
Meeting ID: 785 5125 5396
Passcode: knuth

More about tomorrow's meeting.

At the end of the previous century, TeX Live could be run from disc. Users
could pop a CD into the PC and start to use the TeX software. I'm hoping
that next year beginners can regain that experience (but perhaps via an
internet download).  And elsewhere I've started technical work that might
make this possible (without relying on Overleaf).

My vision of TeX Live is that it becomes a sort of agora (forum or
marketplace) for TeX software, similar to LaTeX being an agora for TeX
macros. And that it is revised annually, to provide fixed points. So the
same inputs give the same outputs across space and time. Safety and
security.

So at tomorrow's TeX Hour I'd like to discuss what users want their STEM
documents for. What's the human purpose each actual and potential user of
TeX is trying to achieve? (Hint: It's probably not making the developer
happy.)

Here's an example. Many R-users want to share their calculations with
others, via both HTML and PDF. The R-Markdown suite allows them to do this.
TeX, packaged as TinyTeX, provides a vital component that helps R-users to
HAVE USED this markdown suite.

Here's another example. I'm a mathematician who has discovered an exciting
new property of the Fibonacci numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 etc. Perhaps
I want to submit a paper to the Journal of Integer Sequences.

And another example. I'm a teacher preparing class notes, and one of my
students has a visual disability. My college has staff to provide
accessibility support. I want to HAVE USED the system so that ALL my
students have access to the class notes.

I want more examples of why people might want to HAVE USED our shared
wonderful typesetting system TeX. This will help developers create software
and systems that are more pleasant to use.

The videos from last week's heavy technical TeX Hour on TeX Live (except
for a few to follow tomorrow) are at:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1FZfIX1w7jEC4iuK5Q0HPccM1IE3ygD

Please enjoy having used TeX
