Hi

This is about improving communication between blind math students and
support staff on the one side and the LaTeX developers on the other.

I'll be brief. Kellee Sanchez's request for help started a discussion which
I found to be very good. It covers many interlinked topics. It will take me
some time to digest and understand. I'm learning so much from this
discussion.
http://nfbnet.org/pipermail/blindmath_nfbnet.org/2021-March/009702.html

I'm a long-time TeX user. I'd like the developers there, particularly those
focussed on accessible PDF and on TeX-to-HTML (or XML), to similarly learn
from this discussion. To make this discussion more accessible to them and
others, I'll summarize it in posts on my blog.
https://jfine2358.github.io/

I think there's a real social problem. TeX users care about typography.
Blind people can't see typography. TeX users love PDF. Blind people, it
seems to me, love accessible HTML. Blind students need accessible material
during the course. TeX developers think long term.

This need not be a problem. We all care about communication and usability.
We have shared interests and values. The social problem I see is that there
are too few connections between these two communities.

Let's have more sharing between the people on the Blind Math mailing list
and the developers on the LaTeX project. This conversation can help both
sides.

The LaTeX developers hope to produce tagged PDF no sooner than 4 years from
now, with math support to follow later. For math support they need to
extract and store the TeX source for the equations.  Achieving this LaTeX
developer goal will I'm sure help blind math users.
https://www.latex-project.org/publications/2020-tagged-pdf-feasibility.pdf

Let's make progress by talking more with each other. And working together
when we can.

with best wishes

Jonathan

Kellee asked particularly about /Fundamentals of Aerodynamics, Sixth 
Edition,/ by John D. Anderson, Jr.? The PDF of this book is available on 
the web, and Adobe Acrobat appears able to convert it into HTML (the 
resulting file is 9MB in size, with 3621 support files totalling 
25,8MB).? I have no way of knowing whether the HTML would be accessible 
to Kellee's student, but I would be more than happy to make the HTML 
available to her if she were interested.

It is possible to do both:

TeX4HT: To add alternate text for images:
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/44009/tex4ht-alt-text-for-images-of-equations
(There may be other methods as well.)

Lwarp: A LaTeX package which can add alternate text for images and links,
adds an 'alt' key for \includegraphics, and SVG images of math include the
LaTeX source as alt text. Lwarp also has support for more than 500 LaTeX
packages, and almost a hundred also support MathJax.

LaTeXML: Also adds the LaTeX source as alt text to its MathML output, and
has some provision for alt text for images.

Each of these also supports MathJax for math output.

Hi

There's a Beginner's TeX hour tonight (Thursday 4 March) 6:30 to 7:30pm UK
time. All are welcome. The zoom link is at
https://jfine2358.github.io/contacts

Summary: Many TeX users need more and better TeX tools that run in a web
browser. And a better social network of TeX users. And a way for experts to
share their experience and knowledge with beginners. This post shows what
can be done now to move us forward.

Subject: Adding styles to a BasicTex install
Message-ID: <CACHdWteR8yhwhH043s2CKO1Ry=9tK13QasWdUDEhkYZCwzA=sQ@mail.gmail.com>

I want to add a number of frequently used styles to my BasicTex
installation. At the moment, the .sty files are included directly within my
repository, but I would like to make them available for all projects
instead of having to copy the files around.

To my knowledge, the particular styles (enumitem and hyphenat, as well as
the vc package - although this is less of a concern) are not included in
the direct download of the small distribution or in the version available
through Homebrew Cask, which I am currently using (e.g, `brew install
basictex`).

Doing some research, it appears the directory structure is not present in
these kinds of installs and must be created after the fact. Following the
instructions provided here
<https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/162117/mactex-basic-and-authordate1-style>
seem reasonable, but I want to confirm this information before doing
anything further.

Is this information correct or is there another recommended way to add
styles and packages to a BasicTex install?

Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB55714212607C856E9CDEB552BE979@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

I'm putting together another set of notes that  is almost
a manuscript and using this as a time to debug my new tool
"toobib" which finds and downloads Bibtex entries for a given url.
This is a more mtaintainable version of my old "med2bib" script.

I like it and wanted to document it for possible release. So, it may
be helpful if I knew how "real people" would collect citations
for scholarly or other research with the intent of writing a 
paper including complete bibliography ( or a DIY project using
BomTex as outlined before ). 

AFAICT, every time you find a paper or abstract you want to cite,
you have to find a button or doi or something and then maybe download
or copy/paste bibtex into your collection - I don't even think google scholar
makes this easy to automate.  My workflow now just means copy whatever link
you have to the clipboard, run my "toobib" program that finds the bibtex for you,
and then add it to your collection. 

For example, if you wanted to cite these works, how would you go about it?

If I can figure out how to get headless chrome to download pdf files, then it will even be
able to read from private cites for which you have credentials.  In theory right now I can 
render to pdf ordump the dom for scraping  if a user provides the right cookie file but have not 
integrated that yet. 

I've got a lot of quirky code specialized to particular publishers but a lot of patterns
have emerged so often it works on novel sites but I'm still adding stuff and
trying to generalize more.

Is this med2bib that is part of cb2Bib?

I would believe each group has its own tools. For example, mathematicians
use MRef:

     https://mathscinet.ams.org/mref

and I am sure other groups use similar tools.

Thanks, I never bothered to check the name and my script is entirely different
but includes some of that functionality. By pubmed format they may mean
what I call medline which I do convert internally. 
My c++ code is just for logic and data structures but invokes
a lot of bash utilities ( wget, sed, awk, headless chrome )  and scripts
including more custom scripts for the eutils automated pubmed access.
However, the new pubmed pages have doi's which may work just as well.

That is another interesting issue is the quality of the bibtex
file which can vary a lot between sources for a given work.
I now have an option to get all entries that I can discover and
it is kind of interesting to see the quirks and quality issues.

I'll have to look at that as it is not immediately clear what that does.
I've tried various technical fields- math, physics, mostly medicine-
and most places that publish abstracts or articles have some similar
means to get the bibtex although some are quite quirky they
may be picked by web people not the "field."

I could put it somewhere but it would help if I had minimal documentation that
compares to realted products. If anyone wants to post a few links I'll
see if I can find the bibtex corresponding to those time permitting. 
I'm also working on an email based server and could integrate this with that.
Then, you could email a robot a bunch of links and get back a list of
bibetx entries for each one. Obviously it could not invoke a browser 
with your current cookies but for public stuff would be ok.

Thinking well into the future, mass deployment would be kind of an
interseting thing. I can take out all the hardcoded bash and move
into configuration files making it more adaptable and general.
Publisher web sites change all the time and likely it would need
to change often too. However, the build process is very simple
and you could almost have it check for and install a new version
on any failed bibtex discovery :) Some publishers for whatever reason
also don't seem automation friendly and may not even like this. 

The architecture is becoming comparatively  "sysetmatic" as it just
tries a big collection of hacks but I think the approach can be generalized
 :) 

Thanks.

I should add that Lwarp also responds to the use of the LaTeX accessibility
and tagpdf packages, creating alt tags for each for HTML output.

The repltext package is ignored by Lwarp, as I am not sure what it should do
for HTML output.  The title text seems appropriate, but see:
https://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/dont-rely-title-attribute-accessibility-seo/
and
https://silktide.com/blog/things-i-learned-by-pretending-to-be-blind-for-a-week/

ARIA landmarks seem to be useful, so I hope to add them soon.

I would be glad to add further improvements for Lwarp's accessibility
features.

Dear TeXers,

March is upon us, which means that the deadline for nomination of TUG
officers is passed.  This year we had fewer nominations than open
positions.  According to the Bylaws the nominees are taking their
positions with the next TUG meeting.  They are: president Boris
Veytsman, and board members: Karl Berry, Johannes Braams, Kaja
Christiansen, Klaus H\"oppner, Frank Mittelbach, Ross Moore, Arthur
Rosendahl.

I want to extend my gratitude to the retiring board members:
Taco Hoekwater, Will Robertson, Herbert Vo\ss.  Thanks for your service!

Speaking of the next TUG.  The vaccination in many countries goes full
steam, and we hope to suppress the epidemics by the end of the year.
Still, there is no guarantee that international travel will be restored in
time for the conference.  Therefore the Board has made a prudent decision
to have TUG2021 online.  The dates are August 6--8.  The official
announcement and call for papers are forthcoming; in the meantime
you may contact the conference committee at tug2021 at tug.org. Submissions
and expressions of interest for presents would be most welcome.

Returning to the topic of elections.  As we announced earlier, TUG is
now an affiliate member of the Open Software Initiative,
https://opensource.org/.  In the coming elections we can compete for a
place on its Board.  Norbert Preining is nominated for an Affiliate
Seat of OSI from TUG
(https://wiki.opensource.org/bin/Main/OSI%20Board%20of%20Directors/Board%20Member%20Elections/2021%20Individual%20and%20Affiliate%20Elections/Preining2021/).
If you are an individual OSI member, you might want to consider his
candidacy.

TUG, being a non-profit, is supported by membership fees and
donations.  If you live in the US and use Amazon for your purchases, as
many people do in these times of pandemics, you may be eligible for the
Amazon Smile program, which donates 0.5% of the money you spend to a
non-profit of your choice.  If you'd like to designate TUG for your
Amazon Smile donations, you may find the link
https://smile.amazon.com/ch/22-2868942 handy.

In other news, Nelson Beebe announces the first release of a complete
bibliography of The Journal of Typographic Research, and an extensive
one of its renamed successor journal, Visible Language.  Both are in a
single file at
http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/visible-language.bib and
http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/visible-language.html. There are
BibTeX entries for 1093 articles in the file, and 966 (88%) of them
have abstracts.  The journals are included in the combined SQLite3
database file at
http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/history-journals.db which
includes BibTeX entries for almost 251,400 articles from 135 distinct
journals in the fields of the history of mathematics, science, and
technology.

New packages on CTAN in February (https://ctan.org/pkg):
atkinson, support for the Atkinson Hyperlegible family of fonts;
eczar, a font family supporting Devanagari and Latin script;
eq-pin2corr, add PIN security to the `Correct' button of a quiz created
  by exerquiz;
hindawi-latex-template, a LaTeX template for authors of the Hindawi journals;
innerscript, modifies automatic mathematics spacing;
langsci-affiliations, collect and order authors and affiliations;
numerica, numerically evaluate mathematical expressions in LaTeX form;
pdfmanagement-testphase, LaTeX PDF management testphase bundle;
quran-bn, Bengali translations to the quran package;
twemojis, use Twitter's open source emojis through LaTeX commands.

Happy TeXing!

Subject: Using vc in a Makefile
Message-ID: <CACHdWtdAOiaeSF+KYH7NWmpM0ejA+kJk1BsgmuS6kNOS5WV3xA@mail.gmail.com>

I am currently using the \write18 method with the vc package, but am
curious as to how it can be used from Make (as described in Unix example in
Section 2.3 of its documentation).

Is this simply including a stanza which runs vc,  or is it something else?
I have yet to find an example which demonstrates this approach.

Hi Christopher,

I am using vc in such a way to typeset my reports in a linux system.

I use my own cls file for the reports. I have the following lines there
(but you can do it in your main.tex file)

% Execute the vc script with full option. I had used the script with bzr,
but nowadays I only use git
\immediate\write18{sh ./vc -f}
% Input the generated vc.tex file with the information gathered by vc
script.
\InputIfFileExists{vc}{}{}
% I have a custom python script that modifies a bit the version_history
table
% (using the vhistory package to print a table with the different versions
a their commit messages)
% My script sanityze commit messages to be able to be typeset by tex
(special characters, and other stuff).
\immediate\write18{./parselog.py > version_history.tex}

% At the proper position (after the \maketitle I input the version history
table.
\InputIfFileExists{version_history.tex}{}{}

In make file yuo just need to activate the -shell-escape option:

compile:
     lualatex -shell-escape main.tex

I hope it helps

I was curious to see that a set of notes I posted on academia,edu was indexed by google
scholar, 

https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2021&q=marchywka&hl=en&as_sdt=0,23&as_vis=1

I don't usually use google scholar for citation info and now I can see explicitly why.
It made up a really bad bibtex and no idea how it did that :)

If you go get the filie, 

https://www.academia.edu/download/65738470/covid19.pdf

I put the  bibtex in the extended information but maybe there is some
standard way to do that. The attached explains what I did in an appendix
while the main document  is more about "toobib" but get
bibtex. The worst part is the academia.edu url will not even download
into wget no matter what I do and the headless chrome
hangs because it is a pdf file...
If I could download it programatically I think my toobib would work :)

I'm sorry I have nothing to do with R Studio.

We develop LaTeX as a free open source solution, but we are not even the people packaging or distributing it and we aren't providing any VPAT compliance information about LaTeX and there is none to the best of my knowledge.

LaTeX is distributed for free anybody can download or use it, so there is no "vendor" as such.

regards
Frank

Interesting. I had to Google VPAT compliance since, not being in the US, 
it has no relevance to my existence :)

I wonder how governments deal with actual democratic systems ;)

Good luck

At this point contacting somebody in US Digital Service or the 18F directorate of the General Services Administration might be beneficial.    They might be able to help in determing if software like LaTeX meets the definition of Commercial Off The Shelf which at first glance it doesn't.    If Section 508 rules are inapplicable then completing paperwork is unnecessary.
 
 

 
Parallel to that I would suggest contacting appropriate counsel for the necessary rightsholder entity for the software.    An ongoing    appropriate point of contact for the government sector may be needed especially when free downloadable software apparently still does not fit a procurement compliance paradigm in 2021.    In an age when nobody wants to wind up in an Inspector General report there is plenty of hesitancy.

Hello,

This is a link<https://www.microassist.com/digital-accessibility/vpat/> to explain VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template). Here is a link<https://www.pdffiller.com/jsfiller-desk10/?projectId=605a017e2f9a71592e01ec10&lp=true#6e9f6ef4a4114976b57cd23ea2f89e60> to a VPAT template that can be filled out online. It has definitions of all the section 508 criteria. This is information that all federal, state, and educational institutions in the United States will require prior to downloading your software products.

Thank you for your help with this.

Sincerely,
Dana Talley

I'm sorry I have nothing to do with R Studio.

We develop LaTeX as a free open source solution, but we are not even the people packaging or distributing it and we aren't providing any VPAT compliance information about LaTeX and there is none to the best of my knowledge.

LaTeX is distributed for free anybody can download or use it, so there is no "vendor" as such.

Frank

Hello,

Several times I have gotten VPAT requests for MacTeX. My reply has always been that TeX Live has thousands of contributors, all volunteers, and I had no idea how to fulfill such a request or interest in doing so. I sometimes suggested that the organization develop a better understanding of the open source movement before submitting  a request.  Once I got an immediate reply that said "you have no idea how much I hate this job; thank you for an honest answer."

I think that we must have this document for at least TeXLive
distribution, and I probably should write one as TUG president...

Dana,

Thank you.  Not anything that I have any experience with but 90+ percent of the items just do not apply.  For example, it is no problem to certify that if someone turns up the audio volume then there is a setting that will make the next person's audio be at default level.  The program as distributed doesn't have audio.

Can you hazard a guess as to whether a person who is not an expert at this could fill it out, or do you really need to be conversant with all the terminology?  I don't know whether there would be any appetite for hiring a lawyer or other such person, I'm just asking whether that would be necessary.

Regards,
Jim

I wonder if one can access the VPAT for PdfFiller ...

But having now seen the template supplied by Dana, and bearing in mind 
that it is a /*Voluntary */Product Accessibility Template, I would be 
minded to ignore the supplied version and instead return one of our own 
design.? It would read :

Q1.? Have all reasonable steps been taken to ensure that TeX, LaTeX, and 
related software is as accessible as possible ?
A1.? Yes.

If the answer to Q1 is "No", please continue to Q2, otherwise the return 
is complete.

Q2.?? In what ways are TeX, LaTeX and related software partially or 
fully inaccessible.
A2.? N/A

Hello Jim,

A lawyer would not be necessary to fill out the form. This form just helps us to determine if your software is 508 compliant. The information below is from Wikipedia.

"In 1998 the US Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508 (29 U.S.C. ? 794d), agencies must give employees with disabilities and members of the public access to information that is comparable to the access available to others."

Dana,

Thank you.  Not anything that I have any experience with but 90+ percent of the items just do not apply.  For example, it is no problem to certify that if someone turns up the audio volume then there is a setting that will make the next person's audio be at default level.  The program as distributed doesn't have audio.

Can you hazard a guess as to whether a person who is not an expert at this could fill it out, or do you really need to be conversant with all the terminology?  I don't know whether there would be any appetite for hiring a lawyer or other such person, I'm just asking whether that would be necessary.

Regards,
Jim

The file is too complex for PDFiller. And being a shop that knows how to
produce PDF well, we should abandon this track of filling a form in PDF and
just =have a LaTeX file that produces the correct results -- it will be wey
simpler and more maintainable.

I am not so sure about the re-design .... :) The format is fixed, despite
being voluntary.

Thank you for the clarification, Dana.   There is no existing VPAT for the software.

We appreciate the patience, and I think you have spurred some of us to produce a VPAT.

I do have the impression nobody actually did read the original
question. Dana wants a "VPAT for R Studio Desktop software".

Message-ID: <LNXP265MB039511D7C1A289CDD19E4B3DCD619@LNXP265MB0395.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello,


Where can I get pstricks support?  A recent Windows 10 MiKTeX
reinstall (also Ghostscript) has broken existing documents.  Rather
than trying to debug one of those, I have started with a clean slate
by using the published example here:

https://gist.github.com/zr-tex8r/08cdd6a868f06c641f25

The resulting PDF does not show the expected graphic, which would
appear to confirm that there is a system problem.  Attached are

* the LaTeX file test.tex;
* the pstricks style file bxdpx-pstricks.sty;
* the log from the dvipdfmx run log.lis.

My GitHub enquiry has not been answered, and I am unsure whether it
is in a place that is being monitored at present.

TIA


Patrick Wallace

You should pass the dvipdfmx option also to the expl3 backend:
For example like this:

\PassOptionsToPackage{backend=dvipdfmx}{expl3}
\RequirePackage{expl3}
\documentclass{article}

I think that is definitely a typo or misunderstanding on Dana's part on how
R Studio and LaTeX work together. VPAT for R Studio is readily available.

Hello! I am working in a article documentclass. It have five section using the command \section. My intention is that each equation number showed a determined format depending on if the section number is odd or even.

I intended using the conditionals, before the \section, for example:
\ifodd \value{section} \renewcommand{\theequation}{\textbf{{\thesection}-\alph{equation}}} \else \renewcommand{\theequation}{\textit{{\thesection}-\arabic{equation}}}\fi

But do not work fine, the compilation does not give errors, but all the numbers of equations are in the same format.

This is my first approach with the conditionals, I am testing this.

May do not work because I charging others archives? like this:

\documentclass[10pt,a4paper]{article}
\input{files_whit_packages_and_commands.tex}

\makeindex[columns = 3, intoc, options= -s file.ist]

Hello! I am working in a article documentclass. It have five section using the command \section. My intention is that each equation number showed a determined format depending on if the section number is odd or even.

I intended using the conditionals, before the \section, for example:
\ifodd \value{section} \renewcommand{\theequation}{\textbf{{\thesection}-\alph{equation}}} \else \renewcommand{\theequation}{\textit{{\thesection}-\arabic{equation}}}\fi

This might work. However there are two problems: (1) in the code you showed, you run this conditional only once, thus choosing the ?even? branch of the conditional, since the section number is zero initially. This will then be in force in the entire document. You would have to run this code together with each \section command. (2) The \section command increments the counter, so if you run your code before \section, the sense of even vs odd will be flipped. Better run it after \section.

A better approach still would be to incorporate the test into \theeequation. Here is a sample document that hopefully does what you want:

\documentclass{article}

\renewcommand\theequation{%
  \ifodd\value{section}%
    \textbf{{\thesection}-\alph{equation}}%
  \else
    \textit{{\thesection}-\arabic{equation}}%
  \fi
}
\begin{document}
\begin{equation} \label{zero}
  a=b
\end{equation}
\section{one}
\begin{equation} \label{one}
  c=d
\end{equation}
\section{two}
\begin{equation} \label{two}
  e=f
\end{equation}
Reference to \ref{zero}, \ref{one}, \ref{two}.
\end{document}

PS. When asking question like this, please do include a minimal, but complete file demonstrating your approach. By complete, I mean something that anybody can compile and which shows the problem you are trying to solve. You are much more likely to get help if you do.

Hi

There's a TeX Hour tomorrow evening (Thursday 1 April) 6:30 to 7:30 UK
time. Beware, the clocks in the UK have moved. This URL gives the time now
in the UK https://www.google.com/search?q=uk+time. Visit
https://jfine2358.github.io/contact/ for the zoom details.

The topic is Helping Beginners. Please come with examples, problems,
solutions and URLs. I'm looking for simple things that can make a
difference. All are welcome.

Here's a suggestion. Add a beginner tag to TeX on StackExchange, so that
this URL gives useful information.
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/beginner

The TeX Hour has a monthly cycle for its topics.

First Thursday: Beginners
Second Thursday: Accessibility
Third Thursday: Conversion (eg LaTeX to PDF, LaTeX to HTML, markdown to
LaTeX)
Fourth Thursday: Durable Documents (same outputs give same input across
space and time)
Fifth Thursday: Experiments and Exploration.

with best regards

Jonathan
