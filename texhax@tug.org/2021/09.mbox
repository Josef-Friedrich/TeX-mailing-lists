Hi

Summary: Most popular computer languages provide useful interactive online
help and documentation. LaTeX

Date and time: Thursday 2 September, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

OVERVIEW
I'd like our community to develop online tools to help LaTeX authors,
particularly beginners. Here's an example. It's easy to make a syntax error
when writing a LaTeX document. And then you get a TeX error, perhaps
unconnected with your error. I'd like to see an online LaTeX syntax
checker, that's linked to a help system.

Searching for https://www.google.com/search?q=json+syntax+checker
immediately gives about 20 online JSON checkers. However, a similar search
for LaTeX doesn't give similar results. I think there's a big gap here.

HTML has https://www.w3schools.com/, which allows you to start learning
immediately. For comparison look at https://www.learnlatex.org/en/.

That's my gripe. I'd like to hear yours, and discuss what we could do to
improve interactive online help and documentation for LaTeX users,
particularly beginners.

INVITE
You're invited to tomorrow's TeX Hour: Interactive online help.
Date and time: Thursday 2 September, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.

Subject: getnonfreefonts on a recent TL and Ubuntu
Message-ID: <MN2PR02MB674989948BE709C27813D77FAECF9@MN2PR02MB6749.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,

I am trying to install Luximono to a brand new Ubuntu and TeX Live installation (Ubuntu 20, TL 2021).  I am having trouble installing getnonfreefonts.  No doubt I am missing some point, but I just cannot see what.  (I am having some trouble with an email account, so I apologize if this message is a dupe.)

As described on https://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/, I used wget to download install-getnonfreefonts to the current directory.   I then tried to run texlua.

  ftpmaint at Alonzo:~/Documents$ texlua ./install-getnonfreefonts
  Detected System: x86_64-linux
  Detected Installation: /usr/local/texlive/2021
  mkdir /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/scripts/getnonfreefonts ...   [failed]
  Sorry, couldn't create directory /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/scripts/getnonfreefonts

(I made install-getnonfreefonts executable but that didn't change the outcome.)  OK, maybe sudo?

  ftpmaint at Alonzo:~/Documents$ sudo texlua ./install-getnonfreefonts
  sudo: texlua: command not found

Maybe it does not like the path?

  ftpmaint at Alonzo:~/Documents$ sudo /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-  linux/texlua install-getnonfreefonts
  lstat(./texlua) failed: ./texlua: No such file or directory
  kpathsea: Can't get directory of program name: ./texlua

Even this did not work.

  ftpmaint at Alonzo:~/Documents$ sudo /usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-  linux/texlua /home/ftpmaint/Documents/install-getnonfreefonts
  lstat(./texlua) failed: ./texlua: No such file or directory
  kpathsea: Can't get directory of program name: ./texlua

I note the kpathsea errors.  If it helps, my /etc/profile says this.

  export PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH"
  export MANPATH="/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/doc/man:$MANPATH"
  export INFOPATH="/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/doc/info:$INFOPATH"

Using sudo -s or sudo su gave similar results (and are at or past the limits of my knowledge).  Googling around gave results from at most 2016, and they didn't help.  Any ideas would be most welcome.

Jim Hefferon

Thank you, Bob.   But a ls shows no such file /usr/local/bin/texlua, and so sudo just says "command not found".   (I got the other address from "whereis texlua".)

Do you have the luatex package installed?

/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux/texlua

should be there, even if there isn't a link in /usr/local/bin

Hi Jim,
yes, if /usr/local/texlive is owned by root...

AFAIK sudo does't use the PATH variable from the environment for
security reasons.

I don't understand why your system calls ./texlua (in your current
working directory) though you specified the full path.  I don't know
why this happens.  This should never happen because it's a big
security hole.

If sudo su doesn't work there seems to be something severely wrong
with your system.  It's the first thing I do after a Linux
installation in order to set the passwd for root so that I can log in
as root with su and without sudo.

The best you can do is to steal /usr/local and avoid sudo in the
future.  You still need it for Debian updates though.

/usr/local is for local additions and there is no need to be owned by
root.  The sole reason it's owned by root by default is that the Linux
installer is not aware of any users and, of course, only root can
decide whom to grant write access to particular directories.

So my recommendation is to steal the local tree:

   sudo chown -R jim:users /usr/local  (if jim is your login name)

If this works you can change files in /usr/local without sudo.  You
don't need and shouldn't use sudo for "tlmgr update" anymore.  And you
can install getnonfreefonts as a mortable user with TeX Live in PATH.
It's even more secure because a mortal user can't break the system.

But I'm concerned because you said that "sudo su" doesn't work for
you.  I hope that at least "sudo chown ..." works.  If not, your
system is broken and we have to examine the files in /etc.

Regards,
  Reinhard

(I made install-getnonfreefonts executable but that didn't change the

I note the kpathsea errors.  If it helps, my /etc/profile says this.

  export PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH"
  export MANPATH="/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/doc/man:$MANPATH"
  export INFOPATH="/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/doc/info:$INFOPATH"

Using sudo -s or sudo su gave similar results (and are at or past the
limits of my knowledge).  Googling around gave results from at most 2016,
and they didn't help.  Any ideas would be most welcome.

Reinhard,

Thank you for the reply.  Yes, /usr/local/texlive is owned by root.  Everything in /usr/local is owned by root, that I can see.  (I doubt that I did anything fancy when I installed, I am not a very sophisticated user and I tend to just follow the instructions.  Of course, I could have flubbed something up.) 

A comment about what I am doing.  I have a textbook where people can download the source.  I am releasing a new version.  So I put a clean install on an old machine, and I am going through my INSTALL, checking that the instructions work.  In 2018 the instruction to install and run getnonfreefonts worked great, but not yesterday.  

It sounds like I at least am not overlooking something obvious.  So thank you to you and Bob for the help.  In my INSTALL I am not going to suggest that people steal the local tree :-), so I will instead install Luximono by hand and include instructions for that.

Regards,
Jim

Hi Jim,
yes, if /usr/local/texlive is owned by root...

AFAIK sudo does't use the PATH variable from the environment for
security reasons.

I don't understand why your system calls ./texlua (in your current
working directory) though you specified the full path.  I don't know
why this happens.  This should never happen because it's a big
security hole.

If sudo su doesn't work there seems to be something severely wrong
with your system.  It's the first thing I do after a Linux
installation in order to set the passwd for root so that I can log in
as root with su and without sudo.

The best you can do is to steal /usr/local and avoid sudo in the
future.  You still need it for Debian updates though.

/usr/local is for local additions and there is no need to be owned by
root.  The sole reason it's owned by root by default is that the Linux
installer is not aware of any users and, of course, only root can
decide whom to grant write access to particular directories.

So my recommendation is to steal the local tree:

   sudo chown -R jim:users /usr/local  (if jim is your login name)

If this works you can change files in /usr/local without sudo.  You
don't need and shouldn't use sudo for "tlmgr update" anymore.  And you
can install getnonfreefonts as a mortable user with TeX Live in PATH.
It's even more secure because a mortal user can't break the system.

But I'm concerned because you said that "sudo su" doesn't work for
you.  I hope that at least "sudo chown ..." works.  If not, your
system is broken and we have to examine the files in /etc.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Jim,

Can you tell us how you install TL? There are essentially 4 ways that
people do that:

1- As a normal user, and leaving it like that
2- As a normal user and changing it all to root after installation
3- Executing TL install under "sudo"
4- Doing and "sudo bash" and executing TL install.

I am trying to see if I can reproduce your problem, and these 4 ways
produce different installations.

Paulo Ney,

I did number (3), thanks.

(My motivation is to give advice to people trying to compile my text, so I've imagined that (3) is the most common.)

If sudo su doesn't work there seems to be something severely wrong

So my recommendation is to steal the local tree:

   sudo chown -R jim:users /usr/local  (if jim is your login name)

If this works you can change files in /usr/local without sudo.  You
don't need and shouldn't use sudo for "tlmgr update" anymore.  And you

It's even more secure because a mortal user can't break the system.

But I'm concerned because you said that "sudo su" doesn't work for

Subject: Sep21 TUG news: conferences, Computers&Typesetting Jubilee, CTAN
Message-ID: <202109042248.184MmZTL008741@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers,

The month of August was special for us: we held the second online TUG
conference: https://tug.org/tug2021. It was a resounding success with
four days packed with presentations, interviews, lectures, workshops and
tours. I am immensely grateful to the people from the organizing
committee, session chairs, speakers, attendees -- everybody who made
this possible. The TUGboat proceedings issue is being finalized, and the
videos will be posted when available on our YouTube channel:
  https://youtube.com/c/texusersgroup

TUG2021 had a rather large number of participants: 406 persons
registered for the conference. This is much more than has ever attended
a previous meeting. One of the lessons is that we should add an online
part to our future (hopefully) in-person conferences.

This is the first time we tried to have an informal AGM during the
conference.  It was an interesting and encouraging experiment, and we
nnmay want to develop the rules of online meetings for the unfortunate
eventuality of having online-only TUG conferences in the future.

One hotly debated topic at the AGM was whether the current four-year
terms for TUG directors prevent some people from serving.  The Board
consensus is that (i) for most (but not all) people it takes several
years to fully learn the craft of TUG steering; (ii) nevertheless
any director may step down before the end of their term, and even
(iii) announce the intention to resign before the full term in
their election statement.

Speaking of conferences, our friends at DANTE tell us that the Autumn
meeting will be held online:
  https://www.dante.de/veranstaltungen/herbst2021/

The fifteenth ConTeXt meeting will take place in person in Bassenge,
Belgium, on September 20--25, 2021:
  https://meeting.contextgarden.net/2021/

And TeXConf2021 (Japan) will take place online on November 13.  The (free)
registration deadline is October 9,  https://texconf2021.tumblr.com/ 

The news of another notable conference was communicated by Yannis
Haralambous: Grapholinguistics in the 21st century: From graphemes to
knowledge, Palaiseau, France, June 8-10, 2022:
  https://grafematik2022.sciencesconf.org/
It is endorsed by ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) and by
ATypI (Association Typographique Internationale). Submission deadline:
January 10th, 2022.

In other news, Pearson Publishing has recently released the Jubilee
(35th anniversary) printing of Computers & Typesetting by DEK:
For the first time, PDF editions are offered as well as hardcover.

Hi

Summary: TeX converts source to DVI, an abstract page description language.
By definition, a rich DVI file contains word-by-word backlinks to the TeX
source. We discuss how to create rich DVI, and how to render it to an
accessible PDF. We compare this to the LaTeX Project approach.

Date and time: Thursday 9 September, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Zoom URL:

OVERVIEW
Producing accessible PDF from LaTeX source would be a tremendous advance
(as would reliable production of accessible HTML). A large part of the
problem of creating accessible PDFs is to merge two document trees, namely
the TeX source (as HTML) and the PDF.  At last month's TeX Conference Frank
Mittlebach presented his solution to this problem.

At tomorrow's TeX Hour I'll present my solution, via the concept of rich
DVI files. This goes back 25 years, to my TUGBoat article "Editing .dvi
Files, or Visual TEX". Although in some ways dated, the basic concepts are
still sound and even more relevant than before.

My approach is to pre-process the source tree so that every word (and
similar source objects) is tagged in the resulting DVI file. This will then
give a rich DVI, from which an external program can create an accessible
PDF. Frank's approach is similar, except that he uses complex and ingenious
LaTeX macros for everything, and tags only the paragraphs.

Frank's approach leads to a multi-year journey to modernize LaTeX, and
avoids the need for a post-processor. My approach can use current LaTeX, by
use of an input filter to add tagging, and an output filter to render the
rich DVI to accessible PDF.

This is an important choice, which will affect TeX for over 30 years. If
you're keen, you can read about these two approaches at

Subject: bug with hyperref/mdframed/TikZ/imakeidx with \fbox in section command
Message-ID: <YUCggqF1dcSo+Z51@free.fr>

Hello,

I found two bugs (I think) related to \fbox{} in section command
(\chapter) in relatively precise cases in term of packages use,
hyperref, mdframed with framemethod=TikZ and also imakeidx.  I attach
minimal examples for each of the two cases.

The first case is with hyperref and mdframed with framemethod=TikZ and
changing the order can prevent the failure.  The message is

! Argument of \boxframe has an extra }.
<inserted text> 
                \par 
l.19 \chapter{chap \fbox{toto}}


The second case happens with the three packages and no different order
can prevent the failure.

! Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \<
             
l.23 \chapter{chap \fbox{toto}}


I also attach the logs.  I use texlive 2020.20210202-3 on debian
testing.

I am not subscribed, please CC me if needed.

Minimal example:

\documentclass{report}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usepackage{hyperref}
%\pdfstringdefDisableCommands{\let\fbox\relax}
\begin{document}
\chapter{Hello \fbox{World}}
\end{document}

Fix: Enable the line with \pdfstringdefDisableCommands.
This avoids the error with the redefinition of \fbox of TikZ
and warnings otherwise.

Maybe, this is fixed the same way as above.
Otherwise provide a minimal working example that shows the problem.

it is not tikz but xcolor which redefines the box command. 

I would perhaps make \fbox \protected.

\documentclass{report}

\usepackage{xcolor}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{etoolbox}
\robustify\fbox

\chapter{Hello \fbox{World}}

Subject: Options for pairing Concrete Roman with a .ttf font
Message-ID: <CABdrMU6U+jTg-sn7+RMGZ0uBjLRLooAcMQxmWuj+aTm23fi+eA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a document (from 2016-ish) that paired Concrete Roman and Euler math
with a web-downloaded .ttf for code listings (it used fontspec to access
that file, and compiled with xelatex).  I find that when I installed a 2021
TeXLive  on a fresh Ubuntu 20, it does not compile.  Can I ask if there is,
today, a way to use ccr with an arbitrary .ttf font?

I have been struggling with this for an embarasingly long time, and I'd be
delighted to be corrected (I apologize if some of what I say doesn't make
any sense), but I find the following.

1) When I put this in the preamble

\usepackage{beton,eulervm}
\usepackage{fontspec}

it results in in the ccr choice being forgotten.  By that I mean  that in
the PDF, Properties> Fonts does not say concrete.

2) I tried then to go all in with fontspec, to install ccr into my font
manager.   I clicked on "+" and added
/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/cm-super/sform10.pfb,
and then ran this file.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\IfFontExistsTF{Computer Modern Concrete}{\typeout{!!!! Yes, it
exists}}{\typeout{!!!! No, it doesn't exist}}

%% \setmainfont{sform10.pfb}[
%%   Path = /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/cm-super/]
%% \setmainfont{sform10.pfb}[Path =
/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/cm-super/]
\setmainfont{Computer Modern Concrete}

\usepackage{lipsum}
\begin{document}
\lipsum[1-10]
\end{document}

I ran xelatex (with a diagnostic because I don't understand the error
message).

(What could "xdvipdfmx:fatal: Invalid font: -1 (0)" possibly mean?)

3) I even tried converting the .ttf via otftotfm so I could just use
pdflatex, but frankly how to get the T1 encoding baffled me.

Is there a reasonable way to get concrete along with a random .ttf?  If the
answer is "no" then that would save me a lot of struggle, so that would be
useful to me also.

Regards,
Jim

It looks like fontspec wants all fonts to be in TU encoding, and since
it cannot find ccr in TU encoding, it substiututes lmr instead.

I performed a quick hack. I copied t1ccr.fd to my working directory as
tuccr.fd and changed T1 to TU.  To my surprise it worked.

Can I ask how you know that?  I was unable to figure that out.

> I performed a quick hack.

OK, I'll try that next.

Today I used autoinst.  Once I ironed out the problems, it created for me a
tree of .tfm's, .fd's, and a .sty.  I was able to get a five line test file
to work, so I took that as a victory.  There were fist pumps in the air.
(My situation is that I have a Free book and I am trying to make it
possible for someone other than me to compile it.  So simple is better than
complex, in that I hope people in the future will find that whatever I
write in INSTALL still works.)

Thanks again, I will see if I can get it to go tomorrow. Regards,
Jim

Subject: Dealing with a bizarre error due to single-quote characters
Message-ID: <CABVT_geGAFU4j9uP9SR-GBvB6tWzhHLo336jom-H4c9BQmnrMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am facing a completely crazy issue that has to do with \input?ing
documents that contain single-quote characters. I have a document
template that includes a pdf_tex image (from Inkscape) in page
headers, which worked perfectly well, until at some point build
started failing with:

```
(./input.latex
! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text>
                $
l.3 %% Accompanies image file
```

It turned out that this was due to single-quote characters occurring
in comments and string literals in the pdf_tex file. I managed to work
the issue around for now by replacing those single-quotes with
something else. What?s crazy about this is that (a) those
single-quotes are completely valid and (b) the error appears and
disappears seemingly randomly depending on the content of the main
file at completely unrelated locations.

Here is a minimal reproducer: https://github.com/serokell/latex-quote-repro.

The example might look like I lost my mind, but, I promise, I did not.
It consists of two files:

1. `input.latex` is the one that is being \input?ed, and it is just an
arbitrary file containing a single-quote;
2. `main.latex` has a pretty random structure and is full of letters
?x?, since I obtained it by minimising a real document.

I realise that, unfortunately, this ?minimal? example is not so
minimal, as it depends on KOMA-Script, but that?s as far as I could
get.

The error is very sensitive to the content of the main file ? removing
any (non-essential) line will make the error go away; also I tried to
minimise the actual gibberish content, so, in most cases, removing one
letter ?x? will also result in the error going away.

I don?t understand if this is an issue with KOMA-Script or with LaTeX.
The entire thing, honestly, doesn?t make any sense to me and the only
reasonable explanation that I have is memory corruption. However,
given the complexity of the setup, I guess, it might be something in
KOMA as well, but I can?t prove this, since, due to the extreme
sensitivity of the error, I can?t get rid of KOMA in the reproducer.

In any case, I will be grateful for any advice and pointers in the
right direction. I guess, the first thing I need to do is figure out
where to report this for further investigation.

Cheers,
Kirill

JH> Can I ask how you know that?  I was unable to figure that out.

Here is the relevant part of the log:

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `TU/ccr/m/n' undefined

Obviously, LaTeX wanted ccr in TU encoding, and failing this, used lmr
(latin modern).

Hi Kirill,

I do not know exactly why it happens, but I believe you see the problem
come and go based on the content of the main file because the error will
only happen when there's a verbatim environment at or near a page boundary.
Here's a slightly more minimal example:

\begin{filecontents*}{input.latex}
%'
\end{filecontents*}

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{scrlayer-scrpage}
\ohead{\input{input.latex}}

\begin{document}
\vspace*{\dimexpr\textheight-\baselineskip\relax}
\begin{verbatim}
x
\end{verbatim}
\end{document}

By changing the \vspace* amount, you can see the error go away when the
verbatim environment is not at the page boundary. I must admit I do not
know exactly why this happens, but it seems like it has to do with the
verbatim environment's catcode setup being in effect at the same time the
page header is processed.

Perhaps there is a more elegant solution than this, but a workaround I
found was to store the contents of the input.latex file in some macro, and
then use that macro inside \ohead rather than \input. This ensures that
the headings are created with a "standard" catcode setup rather than the
verbatim environment's catcodes. One way to achieve that is using the
catchfile package:

Other folks on the list may have a better technical explanation, or may
have a proper fix for this. But maybe this workaround helps you out in the
meantime. Best,

Hi Paul,

Wow, thank you, that?s such a good catch! Now it all makes sense.

Experimenting with this a bit, I also noticed that if I use your
example and put `hello % world` in the input file, somehow the first
page will literally contain ?hello % world? in the header, while the
second one will correctly have only ?hello?.

I am getting the same effect for `hello % world` and the same error
for `%'` with the standard report class and fancyhdr, so the problem
is not in KOMA ? now we know this.
I guess I'll try to get rid of `fancyhdr` tomorrow to see if this is a
bug in LaTeX or in some code that got shared between fancyhdr and
KOMA.

Cheers,
Kirill

I must admit I do not know exactly why this happens, but it seems like it has to do with the verbatim environment's catcode setup being in effect at the same time the page header is processed.

This ensures that the headings are created with a "standard" catcode setup rather than the verbatim environment's catcodes. One way to achieve that is using the catchfile package:

You can use the Computer Modern Unicode fonts [1,2] which provide a 
version of the Concrete fonts in Opentype format.

This seems like a compatibility bug in fontspec. Or somewhere.
Since it worked in previous years. Just because all ttf/otf fonts are
expected to be in TU, no reason to force that on other fonts. Not that
it's anything I'm going to investigate or report :(. -k

Thank you to everyone for the help with this.  I very much appreciate all
the help on something where perhaps I am the only person who will ever want
to do it.  :-)  I'm sure Karl is right that there is some kind of bug
since it used to work.

The thing that eventually worked for me was getting autoinst to give me an
installation of the .ttf font.  (Just for someone who googles and finds
this thread: in short, I found that the .ttf font had a different internal
name than the file.  So I used FontForge to change the name and generated a
new font.  Then autoinst -dryrun -encoding T1 <fontname> gave me a tree of
the .tfm's, vf's, etc.  I copied to TEXMFLOCAL, ran texhash and updmap-sys
on the .map, and a small test document worked.  I find that autoinst is
impressive software, so thank you to Marc!)

Thank you again,
Jim

Message-ID: <79b0f08a-00e7-6d44-142d-5f990370c84c@gmail.com>

Dear Support-Team,

I am having some trouble after installing texlive. I cannot open tlshell 
(Problem with installation: cannot determine release!), fmtutil raises 
the message that the total formats are 0. After some research I 
concluded that the best idea is to remove texlive and possibly 
reinstall. This causes the next issue, I cannot seem to find a way to 
deinstall texlive, I do not know if this is because of a faulty install. 
I would appreciate help how I can fix these problems. I have been using 
texlive on linux without any trouble, but for windows it seems extremly 
complicated.

Thanks a lot and best regards,

Jason Stahlecker

It would help to know which version of Windows you are using.? I will 
assume 7 or 10.? Under Windows 7, try Start / Control Panel / Programs 
and Features.? Search for TeX Live 2021.? Click to highlight it, then 
use the Uninstall/Change option that will manifest itself in the menu 
line.? Under Windows 10, possibly something similar.

Yes.  Looks like fontspec globally sets font encoding - something it
did not before.  Here seems to be the culprit in fontspec-xetex.sty:

\RequirePackage[\g_fontspec_encoding_tl]{fontenc}

Sure the catcode of % is 12 in verbatim, and at the moment when the
header is processed this is still the case. 

You can reset it in the header:


\begin{filecontents*}{input.latex}
%'
\end{filecontents*}

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{scrlayer-scrpage}

\ohead{\catcode`\%=14 \input{input.latex}} %change catcode of % 

\begin{document}
\vspace*{\dimexpr\textheight-\baselineskip\relax}

x

Hi all

Nothing has changed recently (I am quite sad that I haven?t been able to do new releases on my latex packages for some years now). You just need to load fontenc first with the necessary encodings and be careful about explicitly setting the encoding you want for each font you select. Note that fontspec patches commands like \rmfamily to include the encoding selection and it?s possible that I have neglected to add a command to change/customise this?

It would be great of course if the concrete fonts could see a Unicode release. Perhaps we should have lobbied GUST to make one. Mixing old and new font technologies is a bit awkward :-)

Thank you!  Apparently I started using \htmladdnormallink when it
first became available years ago and was not aware that it is not
standard.

I removed all calls to \htmladdnormallink using a program and replaced
them with \url.  I now know I can use \href if I need to change the
text that is clicked.

Subject: An hline input bug?
Message-ID: <YUhqxp34U5rcGXF6@FR-W-S095711.ncifcrf.gov>

This problem did not occur with a previous 2018 version of latex
(Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.19 (TeX Live 2018)), but after upgrading
to the latest latex:

% latex --version
pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.22 (TeX Live 2021)

For this tex file:

================= hline.tex =================
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{|cr|} \hline
\input{mytable.tex} 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
=============================================

where this file is being input:

================= mytable.tex =================
a & 1 \\
b & 2 \\
c & 3 \\
===============================================

This should make a little table like so:

______
|a  1|
|b  2|
|c  3|
------

However, it now gives an error that I did not get for the 2018 version
of latex:

=====
 (./mytable.tex)
! Misplaced \noalign.
\hline ->\noalign 
                  {\ifnum 0=`}\fi \hrule \@height \arrayrulewidth \futurelet...
l.5 \hline
          
? 
! Emergency stop.
\hline ->\noalign 
                  {\ifnum 0=`}\fi \hrule \@height \arrayrulewidth \futurelet...
l.5 \hline
          
End of file on the terminal!
=====

google:
\hline ->\noalign
https://www.google.com/search?&q=\hline+->\noalign
https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Errors/Misplaced_%5Cnoalign

Apparently the \hline now thinks it is not following a \\ because the
data come from an \input.

\input{mytable.tex}\hline

also fails.

Putting the \hline into the input file works, but now there is an
extra vertical bar on the left just below the table like this:

______
|a  1|
|b  2|
|c  3|
------
|

I am reading the table in because it is generated by other programs.

Is there a way to do this?

(For now I'm getting around the problem by putting the entire tabular
into the input file and it works properly.)

Maybe an anomaly introduced by LaTeX's re-definition of \input.? The 
following works OK.

% !TeX Program=XeLaTeX


\documentclass [12pt] {article}

\begin {document}

 ???? \begin {tabular}{|cr|}

 ???????? \hline

 ???????? \primitive \input mytable.tex

 ???????? \hline

Thanks!  The first solution using 

\CatchFileDef{\foo}{foo.tex}{}

is pretty clean.  The second is rather ugly.

This problem will continue to come up because people want to be able
to make simple data tables and read them in.  So I'm wondering if
there could be a way to change \input{} again so it handles this
common situation cleanly.

Actually the second solution:

    \ExplSyntaxOn
    \cs_new:Npn \expandableinput #1
      { \use:c { @@input } { \file_full_name:n {#1} } }
    \AddToHook{env/tabular/begin}
      { \cs_set_eq:NN \input \expandableinput }
    \ExplSyntaxOff

is cleaner as it has zero dependencies.  This is probably in line with
what may end up in LaTeX.

This is a tricky issue, but it's already under the radar (see
https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues/514), and hopefully there will
be a good solution soonish.

Best,

I might be a change in the fontenc package:  looks like now loading it
before fontspec does not change the behaviour.

Yes there is. You get nonsense for various non-ascii chars if you
use T1-encoding with the unicode engines, and that has nothing to do
with fontspec or font formats. T1 (or OT1) simply don't fit to the
unicode input. 

Try e.g. this with lualatex or xelatex:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}
Gr??e 
\end{document}

hyphenation can be wrong to, as it assumes unicode with the unicode
engines. 


With the unicode engines you should use TU for the text. If you want
to use a T1-encoded font, one should stick to pdflatex. ttf-fonts
can be prepared for this engine too (with a bit more work).

Hi Boris,

I don?t have an up-to-date installation to test with on this machine and I can see there may be some interactions between newer LaTeX2e code and fontspec that I need to take into account. I can also see I need to add an interface to change the default encoding for different font families. With that being said, does the example document below appear to work for you?

It?s a bit fragile in terms of loading order and needing that initial \rmfamily. Once we have an example that I can work towards I can try to improve the fontspec behaviour...

Many thanks,
Will


\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{concmath}
\usepackage{fontspec}

\renewcommand\rmdefault{ccr}
\ExplSyntaxOn
\tl_set:Nn \l__fontspec_rmfamily_encoding_tl {OT1}
\tl_set:Nn \l__fontspec_sffamily_encoding_tl {TU}
\ExplSyntaxOff
\setsansfont{texgyreheros-regular.otf}

\begin{document}
\rmfamily hello world

\sffamily sans font

\rmfamily main font
\end{document}

Will,

I ran the file on a machine I am using for testing.  It has a clean install
of Ubuntu 20, with the apt-installed TeX LIve.  The command "xelatex try"
worked and generated these files.

I can also see I need to add an interface to change the default encoding for different font families. With that being said, does the example document below appear to work for you?

No, it still wants ccr in TU encoding...

As far as I can tell, the "collection" referred to is the cm-unicode
*package*.

\setmainfont{CMU Concrete}

works with lualatex but apparently not with xelatex.  It might help if we
used the
file name of the otf font rather than the font name!

Indeed the following seems to work with both lualatex and xelatex:

\defaultfontfeatures{
   Ligatures = TeX ,
   Extension = .otf }
\setmainfont
  [UprightFont = *rm,
   ItalicFont =  *ti,
   BoldFont = *bx,
   BoldItalicFont = *bi]
  {cmuno}

It works with xelatex but to find texlive fonts by font name xetex
needs the font directories to be added to the fontconfig configuration
texlive supplies a fontconfig file for that purpose installed at
/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-var/fonts/conf/texlive-fontconfig.conf
or equivalent place but it is not added to the fontconfig by default
you need to do that post install

it contains

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
  <dir>/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype</dir>
  <dir>/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype</dir>
  <dir>/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/fonts/type1</dir>
</fontconfig>

(although I'd recommend not including the type1 line)


see section 3.4.4 of the texlive manual.

I did this and now

   %  fc-list | grep 'CMU Concrete' | grep opentype

lists the four otf fonts,

but I'm still getting

   xdvipdfmx:fatal: Invalid font: -1 (0)

using xelatex.

what do you get without the grep opentype?  the xdvipdfmx error (I
think) is telling you that it picked up a non opentype font that;s why
I recommend not including the type1 line that is in the fontconfig
file distributed with texlive

Yes, there were type1 fonts listed.  I removed the type1 line, re-ran
fc-cache and now xelatex works.  Thanks.
 I hope this exchange helps users who want to use font names. I still
prefer using file names.

Subject: wdvi(1) networked DVI viewer
Message-ID: <YUte5ZEj6bK1knw3@imac.0x30.net>

Hi,

I have been working on a project and I think it is time to get some
user feedback, hopefully this list is an appropriate place to do that.

My project is wdvi(1), a network enabled DVI viewer. It can fetch DVI
files from remote systems using the standard HTTPS protocol. I have
just released the proof of concept code here:

https://www.0x30.net/software/wdvi/

wdvi(1) is a fork of xdvi(1) with some bugs fixed and of course the
HTTPS fetching feature added. It should compile and run on unix-like
systems. It needs libraries and development headers for openssl,
freetype2, and xaw7.

You can serve DVI files to wdvi(1) the same way as you would serve
HTML over SSL, meaning that if you already have an SSL enabled HTTP
server then you can drop DVI files next to your other documents and
use wdvi(1) to view them.

wdvi(1) can follow links in DVI documents but they must be prepared
using the 'hypertex' driver for the 'hyperref' package, ie

\usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}

I would be interested to know if wdvi(1) compiles and works on your
system, and if you would generally find this software useful.


Best Regards,
Kyle

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is a bit special, and also a bit sad. The UK TeX Users
Group is stagnant, and might very soon decide to dissolve itself. I've been
a member since about 1990 so that will hit me hard.

To help us make the best of what there is, I've taken the initiative to set
up an online forum for TeX users in the UK. The closest we've got to that
today is UK-TUG-Announce. I posted to that list (see below) reporting on
progress so far.

Tomorrow's TeX Hour won't be recorded, and people and issues from the UK
will have priority in speaking. Do come along if you think the meeting is
relevant to you. There's no fixed agenda.

Date and time: Thursday 23 September: 18:30 to 19:30 UK time.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Here's the message to UK-TUG-Announce
===
Dear UK TUG Member

I've some good news. Fellow member Antoni Diller (author of LaTeX Line by
Line) wrote to me:

"I'm interested in being kept informed of the online UK-focused TeX forum
that you talk about in your email.  I've found your emails concerning the
TeX Hour very informative, telling me things I didn't know about such as
various pretty-printing tools.  I'd like to continue receiving these."

I thank Antoni for permission to quote his message. And another person, an
expert in math accessibility and not a member of UK TUG, has also said
they'd like to subscribe to such a forum.

BBC Radio 4 has a program "In Touch" which gives news, views and
information for people who are blind or partially sighted. Yesterday's
episode was The Return to University. Recommended. If you're in the UK you
can listen to it (18 minutes long) at
https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000ztb0

At last week's TeX Hour someone said that their UK-based university was
monitoring uploaded PDFs for accessibility. Their PDFs scored low, although
whether it was the LaTeX or the math that problem wasn't clear.

If you'd like to join Antoni, myself and others in an online forum please
let me know. Or if you have time, come along to tomorrow's TeX Hour (6:30
to 7:30pm).

Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Here's Antoni's website: https://www.cantab.net/users/antoni.diller/

Happy TeXing
