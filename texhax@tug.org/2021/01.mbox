I hope that you will manage to perceive the following piece
of generalized LaTeX source code as other than a totally
impertinent response.

I was hoping to get someone interested in the topics I posted earlier that seem well suited to the TeX products. 
I have encountered the "fixed" nature of the typsetting system but for most serious work I don't
see this as a significant problem for now. I wrote some macro's and hacked up a version
of evince DVI interpretter to control block visibility ( it is nice to collapse blocks
of text away ) and thought it was nice but not high priority.

The strength is the simplicity and portability of text. I have been trying to create interest
in bibtex or bomtex for non-academic site ( anyone who has written high school papers knows you
can cite popular news items or even rather frivolous sites ). Bomtex would be the "bill of
materials" adaptation of a bibliography perhaps even with some system for allowing
an author to get credit when readers buy something based on the bomtex entries
( url with doi included or someway to include a referer header with the doi ).

Latex is much better than these XML languages as humans can read the source code for comprehension
if reasonably written - that was an explciit anti-objective for the XML languages.
In fact, I'm still on and off looking at latex type emails.



For a typsetter or "compiler" or whatever you want to call latex, why not go right
to c++? Even my "med2bib" bibtex downloader script I want to port from a bash script
so I can use the c++ data structures and logic ( but still mostly invoking
things like wget and even sed/grep ). I wrote a basic bibtex parser in C++ so I could
load various bibtex files and clean them up but not sure it is close to
a "conforming" parser. Not sure what exisiting stuff exists for the
basics of TeX.

Dear TeXers,

The strangest year in the lives of many of us has ended. Let us hope
2021 will be much better.

The Great Tikzlings Christmas Extravaganza 2020 was one of the
highlights of the holiday season. If you did not see it yet, you might
want to try https://vimeo.com/492532561. Speaking of interesting videos,
here is another, where Richard Kegler (P22 Type Foundry, p22.com) and
Amelia Hugill-Fontanel (RIT Cary Graphic Arts Collection, cary.rit.edu)
discuss the seven lives of a typeface, specifically LTC Goudy Initials,
including recasting of metal type:
https://youtube.com/watch?v=S1ldj5LMv8Y.

By the way, both RIT Cary Press and P22 Foundry products have been used
as prizes for new members. As a reminder, every year we conduct a raffle
among all new members, and the lucky winner gets a special prize. In
2021 our lottery will have not one, but four prizes from P22; a good
incentive to join TUG.

As in previous years, we have a greatly reduced trial membership fee for
first time members: https://tug.org/trial. On the other hand, if you are
a TUG member already, please do not forget to renew your membership
here: https://tug.org/join.html and enjoy the early bird rate (until
March 31). TUG is supported by the membership fees and generous
donations from the TeX community.

Speaking of TUG business, 2021 is an election year. The deadline for
nominations is March 1; all election information is posted at
https://tug.org/election.

March 31 is the deadline for submissions to TUGboat, our flagship
publication. Please see author information at
https://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html.

New CTAN packages in December:
- albatross, find fonts that contain a given glyph;
- archivo, the Archivo font face with support for all LaTeX forms;
- arvo, the Arvo font face with support for all LaTeX forms;
- bithesis, templates for the Beijing Institute of Technology;
- chinesejfm, luatexja-jfm files for Chinese typesetting;
- easyfloats, an easier interface to insert figures, etc. in LaTeX;
- froufrou, fancy section separators;
- inter, the inter font face with support for all LaTeX forms;
- oswald, the Oswald family of fonts with support for all LaTeX forms;
- pbalance, balance last page in two-column mode;
- puyotikz, quickly typeset board states of Puyo Puyo games;
- skeldoc, placeholders for unfinished documents;
- stepgreek, a free Times/Elsevier-style Greek font;
- uninormalize, Unicode normalization support in Lua.

Last note for the new year: Hans-Martin M\"unch has updated his package
for calendar creation in several languages,
https://ctan.org/pkg/calxxxx-yyyy. I'd also like to mention that Peter
Wilson has once again provided lovely Japanese woodblock calendars
available to all from http://tug.org/calendar.html.

Happy TeXing!

I'm afraid I have no idea ? it's not my workshop. I can't access the link 
from my present location, but perhaps their web site mentions this.

Thanks that is very much appreciated. I will see to join despite the
time difference to learn from your nearly infinite experience.
In particular I am eager to hear your proposals for a reworked TeX in
modern times.

Looking forward to hear from you, and all the best for 2021

Subject: Color changing under graphic inclusion with graphicx
Message-ID: <CAFVhNZPRh6C85ENDKA6qTzVBBnjiET3d5bBQyGZFH8o9ED56uA@mail.gmail.com>

I have (a couple) of PNG images with a background color of, for example,
RGB(80,64,83), that when placed on a page of the same background color with
{graphicx} -- they show a distinct tonality against the background -- which
is of the same color.

````
\documentclass{report}

\usepackage{xcolor}
\definecolor{bgcolor}{RGB}{80,64,83}

\usepackage{graphicx}
\pagestyle{empty}

\begin{document}

\pagecolor{bgcolor}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{A.png}
\quad
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{B.png}

\medskip

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{A-gimp.png}
\quad
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{B-gimp.png}

\end{document}
````

Checking the colors in the included files one can see they have changed
from (80,64,83) to (71,56,74) in the included images.

Just opening the images on `GIMP` and exporting it as-is with the default
choices of

[image: export-settings.png]

fixes everything and the new inclusion now gets the exact color they were
set to begin with, the same as the background, as shown below (second line).


[image: together.png]

What is that TeX needs from the PNG's to preserve their color when included
in a page?

Paulo Ney


PS. For experimentation here are the same images, before and after opening
with GIMP.

try

\usepackage[RGB]{xcolor}

to use xcolor with the colormodel RGB. A color in different models
is not always the same!

my output is attached.

Hi Herbet,

Yes, this does work. ....but it leaves me with more questions than before
....

1- \usepackage[RGB]{xcolor} -- Does that imply that everything in this
document has to be done in RGB???
That seems to be a pretty big restriction.

2-  Is the use of:

    \usepackage{xcolor}
    \definecolor{bgcolor}{RGB}{80,64,83}

not enough to specify that RGB is being used?

3- What does the second row of mages have that the first do not???

No, it means that _all_ used colors on LaTeX level will be converted into
the RGB model. By default xcolor uses rgb (0..1).
This is only a problem when using an image as background. The
colormodell on LaTeX level must be the same as the color model
of your image. Otherwise blue (cmyk) is not blue (rgb) ...

no, there are a lot of possible color models and all must be converted
into one which are valid for the PDF.

I do not understand this question. I used only your four images.

Well, but in my case the background is in RGB. The images are in RGB, and
color is the same in all 4 of them. Two show the difference against the
background and two do not. What is the difference between the first two
images and the last two images?

Isn't PDF the format that allows many color models on the same page?

How would anyone produce a graphics in RGB and another in Lab in the same
page with that restriction?

I attached 4 files and they have the same background color and two of them
show the problem and two not. What is different on the graphics to display
that behaviour?

I am a bit puzzled, because I cannot reproduce the problem ...
will have a look later today

I can't reproduce your problem with the files you provided. 

How do you compile? Which TeX-System do you have? And which viewer
do you use to view the pdf? Can you provide the pdf you get?

For me (Windows 7 64-bit Enterprise, TeX Live 2020), PdfLaTeX does /not/ 
shew the problem whilst XeLaTeX does.? The artifacts are more visible in 
the TeXworks previewer than in Adobe Acrobat CC, but are nonetheless 
visible in the latter.

Hi All

As Phil has already determined, the problem only occurs in XeTeX (not in
pdfTeX or LuaTeX).
And I just checked it is visible in both TL'19 and TL'20.

I also would like to add that if you look at the pre-GIMP and post-GIMP
PNG's, you see some sort of
differences between them, these two being the most important:

59c61
<   Gamma: 0.45455
---
>   Gamma: 0.454545
66c68
<   Background color: srgb(254.012,254.012,254.012)
---
>   Background color: white

but I believe they represent the same thing and NONE of several other
programs I used show any differences
in the display of the images.

It is just XeLaTeX that includes them in different ways.

Hi all,

Sorry, not a \TeX/ question.

Some of you my remember as a brash "kid" that worked with barabra beeton at
the AMS.
I tried to contact her at her AMS address, but it bounced so I think she
may have {\it finally} retired.  I am looking to get in touch with her.  I
know she lives in my area of the USA.

If anyone has any news of any kind, I'd appreciate hearing it from you.

Thanks and regards,

Winging it: Could it be just that xelatex and pdflatex
handle floating point math differently?

Could well be. It did cross my mind, because I tried to reproduce the
problem with other colors
and so far I have not found any other arrangement that shows the
problem.... but who am I to
say ... I understand very little of what is going on.

Hi Tom,
nice to hear from you after so many years (TUG 2000).

You could try bnb at tug.org

Yes, why didn't you mention directly which engine you are using?

Well the backend of xelatex, dvipdfmx, has quite extended PNG
support, see the documentation (texdoc dvipdfmx).

And looking at the pdf one can see that your images are included
with different color spaces. The "wrong" uses CalRGB

<</ColorSpace[/Indexed[/CalRGB<</WhitePoint[.95046 1
1.08906]/Gamma[2.19998 2.19998
2.19998]/Matrix[.41239 .21264 .01933
.35758 .71517 .11919 .18048 .07219 .95053]>>]1<504053ffffff>] 

The other one DeviceRGB: 

<</ColorSpace[/Indexed/DeviceRGB 1<504053ffffff>]


pdftex uses DeviceRGB in both cases. 

I have no idea if  this can be configured, you could check the
documentation or ask on the dvipdfmx mailing list.

Because we are only humans Ulrike. Sorry! I know the drill very well, but
it was
an incredibly hard bug to pin down -- and I am not sure we are done. It was
caught in a Production Suite we developed for a publisher, in the final
printing
of a cover for a book, by someone with a very good eye. For many weeks we
(erroneously) treated as some sort of problem  at the printer end (we do
have
a fair share of those) or some bad conversion of the PDF.

There were many levels and a lot of software packages involved (ImageMagic,
GIMP, TeX, LaTeX packages, ICC profiles, Acrobat ... and whatever else the
printers do to it) and finding the colors, producing the images for the MWE
was
incredibly complex. Soo much so that I initially forgot about noting the
pdf,xe,luatex
differences. Phil picked up gracefully and pretty quickly.

Subject: something dumb on bibtex entry format, 
Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB5571AB4F8923856BC6BA6FA4BEAA0@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

I'm finally moving my bibtex scraping script to c++ and cleaning up a lot
of stuff. I validate a foreign or scraped bibtex entry using latex run on
a test document and my own parser. Its unlikely my parser conforms to 
bibtex requirements exactly so I want to do both. I found what appears
to be an old test case and it still does not make sense. The question
seems to be about backslashes preceding a terminating right brace.
Sometimes they are ok, others not. The test files are xxx.tex and xxx.bib
as shown below.  If I put a backslash on the "month" line before the right brace
it seems to work ( originally there was an abstract entry with the problem but
I deleted it for space and clarity ), 
    month = {2015-09-08 00:00:00 \},

However, doing it on the publisher line fails,

    publisher = {John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd \},




 cat /tmp/xxx.tex

What is the backslash before the brace supposed to do or is there something silly I'm

\} is the latex syntax for \the character } so in fields taking tex streams
you have a literal } character and a missing } to match the {  at the
beginning.
in fields taking numeric entries it's again a missing closing brace and
then a spurious } in the date I would expect.
actually what happens is that bibtex takes this as a literal \ so the
generated bbl file has

\newblock Boston, MA, USA, 2015-09-08 00:00:00 2015. John Wiley \& Sons,
Ltd \.


but \. is the accent command  and the argument here is the \par from the
following blank line so latex gives the error

! Paragraph ended before \OT1\. was complete.

same with the month field teh \ is just passed to latex but here you get

\newblock Boston, MA, USA, 2015-09-08 00:00:00 \ 2015. John Wiley \& Sons,
Ltd.

so you get the safe \   rather than \.{\par} just by accidental chance of
this bib style.  If the bib style had put a full stop rather than a space
after the date you would have had the same error as before.

Thanks, I was originally just trying to do syntax but apparently that is not possible without a format.
My syntax parser is just that and  I wanted a format-independent validation. However, your point
makes sense and now I just returned the rendered reference which really is what matters as long
as the format picks up the right fields. The rendered/pdftotext outputs appear identical with the
backslash or not in the month field,

I guess I'll have to make a validation bst entry that picks up everything and makes errors
more apparent.

As I said that is not in general true, it was just by luck, as the bst
style that you used placed a space after the month so the generated
bibliography had \ which acts as a space.
A bibliographystyle that placed punctuation after the month would get
various errors or spurious accents or math spaces.

so a bib bfile with a trailing \ in any field is not in general usable.

I'm not sure how you'd accomplish it, and can't offer help, but if
you can add this check, to at least give a warning, you'd almost
certainly be able to identify all likely problems of this sort:

In a bibliographic entry, it's extremely unlikely that either a
leading group-defining open brace or printing brace ( \{ ) would
be "matched" by a closing brace of the other variety.  So checking
for properly nested type-braces, and reporting unmatched ones,
would allow you to manually identify and correct as necessary.

Also, but generally unrelated, initial or terminal spaces within
individual bib items (author, title, etc.) are generally undesirable
and can result in unwanted spaces in output, unless care is taken to
ignore them in processing (may be done, but not guaranteed; I don't
know how rigorous bib-processing macros are in this regard).

Hope these observations are useful.

The plot thickens ....

I posted to the `dvipdfmx` mailing list as suggested by Ulrike,
and after a lot of discussions with Shunsaku Hirata (????),
I am getting more and more convinced that this is a bug with
pdflatex and lualatex and that xelatex is doing the right thing.

He explained to me that the two images {A,B}.png, as manufactured
by ImageMagick, are defined in a ColorSpace called CalRGB and
do contain calibration settings.

GIMP is not able to handle the calibration data and ignores it when
exporting -- which is why {A,B}-gimp.png do not contain any such
data and are written in the DeviceRGB ColorSpace.

The work is somewhat hard because one needs to look inside the
PNG to check this up -- apparently there are NO tools to detect
the ColorSpace of a PNG, despite claims by ImageMagic "identify"
suite.

He says, that just like GIMP, both pdftex and luatex are NOT able
to handle the calibration data either, so that is why -- when all of
them drop the data -- you see no differences in the border of images.
The two top images are now being handled in the wrong ColorSpace
inside PDF (DeviceRGB instead of CalRGB).

Could anyone suggest the next steps? This seems to render pdfTeX
and luaTeX unusable for color-production work.

Thanks, I'm trying to update and generalize the parser anyway so it
is easy to include nesting levels for many things. Right now,
all I have is braces along with toggles for escapes and quotes.
Adding the "escaped" brace count turned out to be easy although I
don't track order right now. I guess a user could want to write
about a right brace or something :) So, I list it as an observation
and dump with output if there is a real error. Ultimately I want
to clean up and canonicalize the entry, including my own fields
currently included as comments. I'm not too worried about copying
bibtex behavior as I'll just run bibtex with an ok bst. My parser
should at least pickup things that don't conform to basic expecations :) 

Right now the parser just complains at the EOF when it doesn't have enough
right braces. At this point, it dumps the partial strings it already parsed
and you can see it ends around the month field ( the "strings" may contain
"spurious" chars as it dumps 8 chars even if string shorter... ) so you
may start looking there but the observation at the end does help.

In theory once parsed, I can write everything out uniformly and fix
stuff like that or at least make it consistent...

Hi

First of all, there's another TeX Office Hour tonight 6:30 to 7:30pm UK
time. (This message was sent at about 2:45pm UK time).  You'll find the
zoom URL on both of these new posts to my blog.

https://jfine2358.github.io/post/2021/01/21/blind-math-news/
Summary: We look at some recent posts on the Blind Math mailing list. My
main conclusion as a TeX developer is that many on that list prefer
accessible HTML to accessible PDF. This is something that TeX developers
need to be aware of.

https://jfine2358.github.io/post/2021/01/21/multi-author-docs/
Summary: This post is about how TeX might help some small niche use cases.
We study one example, and suggest how it might scale to others. The scaling
depends on non-TeX software and systems, such as web frameworks, and server
/ cloud computing.

The Multi Author Docs post arose from a discussion with Gernot Salzer at an
earlier TeX Office Hour. I'm most grateful to Gernot for the discussion and
his subsequent help.

with best regards and happy TeXing

Jonathan

Hi Jonathan,

It is very encouraging that more publicity is given to the needs of
the blind math learners and practitioners out there, my salutations
for reporting on that!

I wanted to add a note that we have a small, but currently quite
active, group of practitioners that is working on the next version of
MathML, and one of our primary new deliverables is a much upgraded
capability for accessible mathematics. TeX is indeed one of the main
input methods we are aiming to stay fully compatible with, alongside
Word (and more generally "equation palettes").

Curious minds are welcome to listen along by freely joining the
community group at:
https://www.w3.org/community/mathml4/

I will bring up the Blind Math mailing list for discussion at our
weekly meeting today, it sounds like a good venue for us to do some
additional outreach and recruit feedback.

Greetings,
Deyan
