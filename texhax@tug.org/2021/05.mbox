Subject: Using fonts from the LaTeX Font Catalogue.
Message-ID: <20210503151242.465007b8@rolf-Latitude-E7470>



In respect of the subject line of this email, basically my question is:

   How the <expletive deleted> does one do it?

/* rant on */

I have done considerable web searching, and so far have found zero
(and possibly a negative amount of) enlightenment.  Everything that I
have seen seems to start off in the middle --- or at the upper end ---
and is filled with jargon, acronyms and references to concepts that
have no meaning to me.  No examples ever seem to be given.  People
assert that there are clear instructions provided, but as far as I
can tell there are none. I'd like a simple recipe, with one or two
minimal examples, that I could follow and adapt.

/* rant off */

Let me give an explicit example.  I'd like to make use of a cursive
script font.  Looking through the LaTeX font catalogue, I found a font
that seems to be essentially what I want: BrushScriptX-Italic

Now here's some LaTeX code:

\documentclass{article}
% ???
% ???
\begin{document}
The quick brown hippopotamus jumped over the lazy elephant.
\end{document}

What can/should I put in the preamble, in place of

> % ???
> % ???

so that I get the sentence shown to come out in "BrushScriptX-Italic"
font?  Are there *other* steps that I would have to take, in addition
to putting lines in the preamble, in order to achieve the desired goal?

Perhaps downloading some package?  Placing one or more commands within
the document proper?

Surely it can't be all *that* difficult to explain in a straightforward
manner!  (But as I said in my rant, I have found nothing that even
comes close.  And that's an understatement.)

I'd be grateful to anyone who can get me started on the right track.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Hi,

Seems instructions are on the page under "Usage" and "Style examples"

https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/brushscriptxitalic/

Also, the sample code provided is useful too.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pbsi}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\begin{document}
\bsifamily

The quick brown hippopotamus jumped over the lazy elephant.

\normalfont

The quick brown hippopotamus jumped over the lazy elephant.

\end{document}

In the LaTeX font catalogue where you found
BrushScriptX-Italic, click on BrushScriptX-Italic. That
will take you a page with a Text example, Usage and Style
example. And there is also a link to the LaTeX source of the
Text example. And you are told that the relevant package is
part of TeXLive and its location at CTAN.

Does this help?

"Physician, heal thyself" ? if you could give examples of the "jargon, 
acronyms and references to concepts that
have no meaning to [you]", others might be better placed to explain them.

An interesting question.? As one who never willing uses LaTeX, I started 
by trying the obvious ?

That did not work, because TeX Live has not provided TTF or OTF files 
for BrushScriptX-Italic.? So I used Voidtools "everything" to find all 
instances of files named BrushScriptX-Italic, and found 
BrushScriptX-Italic.pfa and BrushScriptX-Italic.afm.? Thinking that a 
pure PdfLaTeX solution might work, I then tried ?

but that did not work either, reporting ?

Therefore I cannot help, but others undoubtedly will be able to do so.? 
I would imagine that some intermediate steps might be required to make 
the Adobe Type-1 font "BrushScriptX-Italic.pfa" usable by LaTeX,but 
since it is well over 20 years since I last felt the need to use a 
Type-1 font with TeX, I no longer have the slightest idea of what those 
steps might be.

That is very useful information, Bob, and it would not have occurred to 
me to click on the name of the font in order to learn more, but I am 
somewhat disappointed to find that the additional information provided 
is predicated on the use of a font-specific package ?

Whilst this adequately addresses the question of "how is one intended to 
use the font 'BrushScriptX-Italic'", it does not address Rolf's more 
general point of "how does one use an arbitrary font selected at random 
from the LaTeX Font Catalogue".? Since BrushScriptX-Italic is provided 
as an AFM/PFA pair, a more general answer would have addressed how one 
can use /any/ font provided only in these formats, but to conceal the 
details in a package "pbsi" without documenting how the desired aim is 
accomplished is not as helpful as it might be ...

I regret that I've disappointed *you* but I'm sure that Rolf
will understand the general point that one uses an arbitrary
font selected from the LaTeX Font Catalogue by clicking
on the name of the font and following the instructions
presented on the font-specific page. Usually those will
involve using a package that provides the infrastructure
required by *LaTeX* processors. I suggest you prepare a
*TeX* Font Catalogue that provides comparable instructions
for users like yourself who avoid LaTeX.

I think that you (perhaps intentionally) miss my point, Bob, which has 
/nothing/ to do with my loathing of LaTeX.? The situation is directly 
analogous to the well-known apophthegm "Give a man a fish, and you feed 
him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for life".? In the 
present example, use of? BrushScriptX-Italic requires a dedicated 
package, "pbsi".?? I have no idea how many fonts are listed in the LaTeX 
font catalogue, but if each and every one of them requires a dedicated 
package, then therein lies madness.? What is required is not a a link to 
a /package/ but rather a link to the description of how one can use an 
arbitrary font supplied only as an AFM/PFA pair ? document that, and you 
feed a LaTeX font catalogue user for life.? Document only a package 
dedicated to one single font, and you feed him for only a day.

Philip: In my opinion it is madness to put the onus of
providing full LaTeX support on users; but if any user
prefers, they can consult my 2013 TUGboat article on fonts
which provides detailed instructions using the lcdftypetools
and fontools packages and, when necessary, font-editing
software such as fontforge. Using these techniques, I and
others have developed dozens of font-support packages that
seem to be greatly appreciated by LaTeX users.

The name must point to a tfm and not to a pfa or afm. 

Perhaps your long use of xelatex made you forget how to fish a font
with pdftex?

Although I very much hesitate to enter this discussion, no one
so far has mentioned that every single font name shown for the
fonts listed in the LaTeX Font Catalogue is a live link.

In these web-aware days, it should be second nature to test that
possibility, even if one is color blind.

Well, as far as I am aware, I do not have deuteranomaly, and I can 
clearly see that (e.g.,) "BrushScriptX-Italic" is brown whilst "The 
quick brown fox jumps over the sleazy dog" is black, but there is 
nothing whatsoever in that to suggest to me (at least) that one, or 
other, or both, is/are [a] hyperlink(s).? A note to that effect at the 
top of the page would much improve matters in that respect.

I suppose you've never noticed that your cursor changes from
an arrow to a pointing hand when hovering over a hyperlink
(at least in Chrome on Linux or Windows; don't know about
MacOS).

Yes, it does! Playing with Dr. Litchfield sample code, I came out with this:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{pbsi}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{txfonts}%%% <- selects the txfonts (Times) by default

\begin{document}
\bsifamily

The quick brown hippopotamus jumped over the lazy elephant.

\medskip

\normalfont %%% <- Times from the txfonts package

The quick brown \emph{hippopotamus} jumped over the \textbf{lazy} elephant.

\medskip

\usefont{T1}{ppl}{m}{n}\selectfont %%% <- Palatino

The quick brown \emph{hippopotamus} jumped over the \textbf{lazy} elephant.

\medskip

\normalfont

Back to Times (from the \texttt{txfonts} package)\dots

\end{document}


I would advise you to consult the "LaTeX2e font selection" document, by 
the LaTeX3 Project Team. In your terminal,

     texdoc fntguide


Best,

Axel

Am I too old-fashioned that for me the obvious is to read the
documentation first?  The documentation recommends pbsi.sty, which
solves the problem.

By the way, for plain TeX users the road is only slightly more bumpy:
t1pbsi.sty inputs pbsi.fd, which has the lines

\DeclareFontShape{T1}{pbsi}{xl}{n}{
   <-> s * [1.2] pbsi8t
}{}

Thus the following should work - and it does!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\font\myfont=pbsi8t

\myfont The quick brown hippopotamus jumped over the lazy elephant.

The problem is, Boris, that unless one recognises (or knows) that all 
entries in the LaTeX font catalogue are hyperlinks, one has no way of 
knowing that such documentation exists.

Message-ID: <148913550.85821545.1620073415957.JavaMail.zimbra@mathemaesthetics.com>

Enclosed is a MWE (boiled down after four hours of work from a 300-page document with hundreds of color boxes in it) that shows a problem I've not been able to figure out.

Placing some text in a \hypertarget on a page seems to fool the tcolorbox package into breaking the page way prematurely, after just one line!

The only remotely pertinent message in the log is

>| Package tcolorbox Warning: The upper box part has become overfull on input line 113.

I can't tell what this has to do with anything, though.

Peculiarly, if one merely changes the top page margin from its current .85in to .75in, the page break after the first line on page 2 disappears and the entire page fills with text inside a color box in an expected way.

Same change occurs if you comment out the two {adjustwidth} environment-related lines from the geometry package, which nominally do nothing:

  \begin{adjustwidth}{0.0pt}{0.0pt}
   ...
  \end{adjustwidth}

The bottom of page 3 shows that something's also wrong with the page height calculation on that page.

Any help or workaround that makes this work as expected would be appreciated.  The one caveat is that I'm using TeXLive 2019, so perhaps there's been a bug fix since then.

Thanks.

I have to agree, with some in here, that on matters of font-installation
TeX gets a huge black-eye.

Yes, it is possible to read all the web-pages and material included and
install it, to know all that it takes to produce a page in plain-TeX, but
nonetheless it is still a mess and out of sync with the rest of TeX
installation and use. TeXLive did a huge improvement in everybody's life
mid-90's as far a TeX installation, but font-installation and use continues
on a pre-90's level.

Even with XeTeX and LuaTeX, that made a lot of this mute, it is, in some
cases, extremely hard to know even the "name" they need in order to load a
font via fontspec.

If you are looking for specialty fonts, like hieroglyphs,music, ... you are
in for a ride and a lot of reading before you can produce a single line of
text.

The situation is so messy that even for important fonts like MathTime Pro,
people go on to create their own installation scripts:

                https://github.com/jamespfennell/mathtime-installer

a script that does what it says (install the font) but in the process
damages your TeXLive installation.

"getnonfreefonts" changed that for the short list of its 11 current fonts.
It would be nice to see it extended to "getanyfont", I have given it a
thought a few times I had to go through one of these font installations.

Dear TeXers,

May is upon us. Here in the US the vaccination campaign is efficiently
decreasing the level of the pandemic, though there is far to go. The
European Union after a slow start also picks up its vaccination
campaign. However, worldwide COVID is far from being conquered. Our
hearts are with our colleagues and friends in India and other countries
experiencing a dangerous new wave.

TUG2021, as we announced earlier, will be held online on August 5--8:
https://tug.org/tug2021/

Registration is open (no cost), and the call for papers is posted 
(deadline June 24): https://tug.org/tug2021/callforpapers.html
Please send in presentation proposals sooner rather than later
if possible. It greatly helps in planning.

Also, the 15th ConTeXt meeting will take place on September 20--25 in
Bassenge, Belgium; the call for papers: 
https://meeting.contextgarden.net/2021/

In other news, TUGboat 42:1 is with the printers; printed copies should
go out by the end of the month. It is going to be a very interesting
issue. The next issue will be the proceedings of TUG2021.

In addition, the TeX Collection DVD, containing TeX Live, MacTeX,
proTeXt/MiKTeX, and a CTAN snapshot, is at the manufacturer's and can be
ordered now from TUG:
https://tug.org/texcollection/

Many users have been for quite some time asking us for an
Accessibility Conformance Report based on VPAT templates.  It
increasingly becomes a requirement for the use of TeX tools in a
government related context for many countries.  We started the effort
of drafting one (https://github.com/TeXUsersGroup/TeX-VPAT).  If you
want to join it, please write to me at president at tug.org.

New packages on CTAN in April:
- beamerthemelalic, a beamer theme for LALIC;
- byo-twemojis, `Build Your Own Twemojis' with TikZ;
- dimnum, commands for dimensionless numbers;
- dynbrackets, commands to simplify the syntax of dynamic math brackets;
- figchild, pictures for creating children's activities;
- huawei, template for Huawei documents;
- mahjong, typeset Mahjong Tiles using MPSZ Notation;
- ninecolors, select colors with proper WCAG color contrast;
- tipauni, producing Unicode characters with TIPA commands;
- tlmgr-intro-zh-cn, a short tutorial on using tlmgr in Chinese;
- worldflags, drawing the world's flags with TikZ;
- xintsession, interactive computing sessions (fractions, floating
  points, polynomials).

Happy TeXing!

Ulrike -

Thanks muchly.  That patch makes things work as expected on my TL2019 install, which is certainly a relief!

Will there be harms from making that patch on later releases of hyperref?  Or is it a mere redundancy?

To that end, what is the hyperref package version/date I can test against above which the patch is unnecessary?  The reason is because my LaTeX code is actually being generated automatically by another program, so I have to be as robust/nuanced about applying patches as possible.  My understanding is that I would have to use a construction like:

\@ifpackagelater{hyperref}{202?/05/03}
  {%
    % Patch is unnecessary
  }
  {%
    % Patch code here
  }%

What date should one use?

It would help us understand what exactly you are complaining

The MathTime Pro fonts are commercial and you cannot blame

Heartfelt thanks to all who responded to my cri coeur.

I have small number of comments.

That was where I initially stumbled.  I'm just not a point-and-click
weeny, and it never occurred to me to click on the font names.  Obvious
in retrospect.

Apparently Philip Taylor, one of the contributors to this discussion
also stumbled at this hurdle.

In response to Philip Taylor, Bob Tenant later wrote:

No-one ever went broke by underestimating my level of understanding! :-)
I *didn't* get that, although I do now.

I accessed this source file, and found it to be rather bewildering and
unnecessarily complicated.  It loads the "scrartcl" package which I
gather is part of the "Koma-script" bundle.  I don't really understand
what Koma-script is all about, but I have the impression that it could
make life a lot easier in respect of handling fonts if one could learn
to drive it.  The fact that its manual is 563 pages long is a bit
daunting however.

I found Alan Litchfield's instructions (and the bare-bones Usage and
Style example) much more perspicuous.

Well, yes.  Now that I can get to square one it does.

That was something I didn't know about, and to which I had previously
seen no reference.  Could indeed be useful.  However when I looked at
this document I found it a bit daunting.  I note that it says "[This
guide] is intended for package writers who want to write font-loading
packages ...."  That is certainly not my circumstance.  Writing such a
package is well beyond my capabilities.

Finally Paulo Ney de Souza contributed a posting that was highly
critical of TeX in respect of matters of font installation.  I agree
with Paulo and (as my initial posting indicated) I find the whole
process to be bewildering.

OTOH one has to cut the designers and builders of TeX and LaTeX and
various variants some slack.  Fonts are tricky things.  To start with,
it is not at all clear to me just what a font *actually* is!!!  In one
document that I looked at a distinction seemed to be made between
"font" and "typeface".  I'm sure it's an important distinction,
but I don't get it.

There are a plethora of considerations about how a font is specified:
what sort of files information about the font is stored in, the fact
that some fonts are (unfortunately) proprietary, the fact that
technology (software and hardware) keeps changing and user demands keep
changing so that the ground is constantly shifting under everyone's
feet, and so on.  Such considerations make it impossible to create a
really effective and friendly font selection system.

My fundamental desideratum is for clearer explanation.  Better
documentation, readily accessible information, simple recipes that
don't require one to read 300 pages of material in order to get started.
And when someone asks a (probably dumb) question, please try to
appreciate that the enquirer is coming at the question from a
completely different viewpoint from that of a TeX/LaTeX/etc. guru.
What's totally obvious to you is not at all obvious to us Bears of
Very Little Brain.  We need a simplistic step-by-step recipe.

I think I've got one now, in respect of how to use fonts from the
LaTeX Font Catalogue!  Thanks to everyone.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

The current code in hyperref is not exactly the same: we added some
breakpoints to resolve your issue, but now there are too much:

The code I send you yesterday is what I plan to add to the next

OK, so now we know that as well as its plain text name, 
BrushScriptX-Italic is also known to TeX as "pbsi8t".? A quick search 
using Voidtools 'Everything' reveals that TeX Live 2021 contains, in 
addition to the aforementioned, t1pbsi.fd, pbsi.sty, pbsi8t.vf, 
pbsi8t.tfm, pbsi8r.tfm, pbsi.tfm, pbsi.map and config.pbsi.? Strangely, 
it does /not/ contain "t1pbsi.sty", wherein Boris found a reference to 
"pbsi.fd", and indeed my entire 32TB disc farm does not contain a file 
of that name, nor does it contain Boris' "pbsi.fd".? Perhaps these are 
specific to Unix installations ? I wot not.

So, might it be an idea to augment the LaTeX Font Catalogue to give the 
TeX-specific names for the listed fonts, as well as their canonical names ?

The LaTeX Font Catalogue now has the following on the
relevant pages:

  Click on the individual fonts to see further examples and
  instructions for use with LATEX.

Sorry about that. I never looked at that source file but
assumed it was the source for the Text example; but in fact
it's the source for the "PDF sample" which also has a font
table.  That's why it's so complex.  All you needed to look
at was the Usage and Style example.

Sections 2.1 and 2.2 are essential reading for LaTeX users.

Think of "typeface" as being a font *family*, typically
including roman, bold, italic and bold-italic fonts.

You find a 100 line document with 11 lines of preamble complicated?

scrartcl is used in the example as it offers commands to change the
font of the sectioning easily, and so allow to demonstrate how the
fonts looks there:

\setkomafont{section}{\usefont{T1}{fvs}{b}{n}\Large}

No, fntguide is mostly for package authors.

Yes the old cry for simplicity. Sorry but you are from an
university. What would you tell a student, complaining that the book
about statistic is too long and complicated, I don't want to learn
this, can't you explain it on two pages in simple words for someone
with "Very Little Brain"?


Well the simple recipe is: 

For many free fonts there is a latex package you can use and that is
installed with your tex system. Such a package typically has a short
documentation or readme which tells you if this is a serif or sans
serif font. The font catalogue has normally a sample document and
also links to the ctan page. 

If you want to use some professional special font or some old font
without proper latex support, find someone to create such a package
for you. Fonts are not easy stuff, it requires some skills, and
people like Bob or Michael which build and maintain such packages
didn't learn this in a day.

Oh come on, use your brain and not only "Voidtools". Compare your
list above with the names Boris used and make an educated guess that
he made a typo and that t1pbsi.sty should be pbsi.sty and pbsi.fd
should be t1pbsi.fd.

I don't think that it would make sense to confuse new LaTeX users by
long list of internal names they don't need to know. 

The general advice to use any font in latex is to try to find a
support package and to use it.

I think that you mis-read, or misunderstood, Bob.? Boris did not mention 
"pbsi.sty", nor did he mention "t1pbsi.fs"; rather, he mentioned 
""t1pbsi.sty" and? "pbsi.fd" [see below], neither of which can I locate 
in 32TB of storage space including all versions of TeX Live going back 
to 2008.

And people wonder why some prefer Microsoft Word to TeX.

Really, I am having great trouble not using profanities here ? someone 
wants to use a different font to the default, and they have to search 
for a /support package/ in order to use it ?!? What sort of insanity is 
this ?? If, as I suspect, the problem lies primarily with those fonts 
that exist only as AFM/PFA (or B) pairs, then why don't we just mark all 
such fonts as "deprecated" and recommend only those fonts that exist as 
TTF/OTF ?? These can then be handled natively by Xe[La]TeX, and will 
need no "support package" at all.

Incidentally, I now see that BrushScriptX-Italic existed as a PFB file 
in (some) earlier releases of TeX Live (e.g., TeX Live 2008, 9, 10, 11, 
12).? What happened to the PFB file thereafter, and is this in part a 
cause of the problem ?

What is your problem? We can't in tex use some pop-up dialog to
setup fonts, we have to add code. We can't preload the code for all
existing fonts into the latex format, so some code has to be added
at run time. Normally people don't want to copy&paste identical code
around and fill up their preamble with it, so such code is in some
external files so that it can be loaded from various documents.

We use \usepackage to load code from external files, you use perhaps
\input{my-font-setup-for-X}.

open type fonts make life a bit easier as you don't have to prepare
tfm and vf-files, but they need code too and for some of the larger
families there are a number of support packages, e.g. fira or
libertine. How many lines does it take you to setup the fonts for a
document? With all the (perhaps optical) fontsize, bold, italic,
small caps etc? Do you do this setup always in the main tex file or
do you have some prepared files you input?

I don't know why the pfb was replaced by a pfa but it isn't
the cause of any problem. But I have no idea what you think
is a problem.

My "problem" is with the idea that each font should require a separate 
package before it can be used.? If we take (for example) all fonts that 
are supplied only in AFM/PFA/PFB formats, could there not be one 
"AFMPFX" package that would make /all/ of them available ?? And 
--ditto-- for any other family of fonts that is differentiated from all 
others families by the format(s) in which it is supplied, assuming that 
the font format is the primary determinant as to how a particular font 
should be used with LaTeX ?

I regard TeX as a never-ending search for excellence.? Each time that I 
start work on a new document (at the moment, for example, I am 
typesetting a restaurant menu on B3-folded-B4), I carry forward in my 
mind how I have handled analogous problems in the past, and then I try 
to improve on it.? Only in (literally) the last 24 hours have I 
discovered how (for example) to save the current font selector, modify 
the definitions of one or more font selectors, and then re-instate the 
/a priori/ font selector with its revised meaning.? I assumed (wrongly, 
as it turned out) that one could just write :

 ??? \edef \currentfont {\the \font}%
 ??? <amend one or more font selectors>
 ??? \currentfont

but this does not work.? Instead, I had to use :

 ??? \edef \currentfont {\the \font}%
 ??? <amend one or more font selectors>
 ??? \scantokens \expandafter{\currentfont}%

Only after discussions with David Carlisle (to whom many thanks, as 
always) did I learn that "\the \font does not return the actual csname 
used to select the font originally [but instead] returns an internally 
generated token which displays using one of the names that was used with 
that font".? And that internally generated token does /something/, but I 
wot not what (its expansion appears to be empty, in that nothing 
untoward is typeset).? I /think /that it selects "the font formerly 
known as \<whatever>", but not "the font current selected by 
\<whatever>".? And I can find no mention of this at all in /The TeXbook/ 
? I still have to check /TeX by Topic/, /The
Advanced TeXbook/, /and //TeX in Practice /(vols~1?4)/.

What would be the gain? I would have to load 

\usepackage{afmpfx}

which would contain thousands of code lines to setup code for
hundreds of fonts I don't want to use and I would have to use
additionally some command to select roboto. \usepackage{roboto} is
less typing, does the same and would load only a small number of
code lines.

It is not. The font format is important internally but the packages
are quite good at abstracting this layer if a font exists in more
than one format. So \usepackage{roboto} will work with pdflatex and
xe/lualatex and use the right font format depending on the engine.

The problem, Bob, is that one should not need a /package/ in order to 
use a /font/.? A font is a little thing, rather like (say) colour.? If I 
want to typeset a stretch of text in blue, I don't expect to have to 
load a package "blue.sty" ? I expect there to be a package called (say) 
"colour.sty" that will allow me to use /any/ colour that I can specify 
in a meaningful way.? And that is how I would expect fonts to be 
handled, by (say) a package called "type-1-fonts.sty" that would allow 
me to use /any /type-1 font that appears in the LaTeX font catalogue.

But the real problem, I fear, is that you don't see there to be any problem.

The gain, Ulrike, would be that in order to answer Rolf's /cri de c?ur/, 
one would simply have to say "use the AFMPFX package, Rolf ? that will 
allow you to use not only BrushScriptX-Italic, but will also allow you 
to use any type-1 font listed in the catalogue. And if you want to use 
some fonts that exist only in a different format, then you just need to 
load the package for that format, regardless of the actual font(s) that 
you want to use".

Phil: I have good news for you: in TeXLive, just three
"super-packages" provide *all* available fonts in *all*
available formats. The super-packages are called collections
and one simply installs the fontsrecommended and fontsextra
collections and, if desired, run the getnonfreefonts
program. And if you have already all of TeXLive installed,
you only need the last of these. Isn't that an even better
solution to your "problem"? Of course for LaTeX you still
have to select the actual font family or families you want
in your document by commands of the form \usepackage{...}
or possibly \setmainfont{...}. The fact that these load a
family of fonts rather than an individual font is surely a
great convenience compared to the primitive mechanism in
plain TeX.

Your idea that there could be a single package covering all fonts or that

>   A font is a little thing

show a complete misunderstanding about what these packages do.

Setting up a font is not a single \font command.  Typically you need to
know what optical sizes are available, which font do you use for 9.5pt
computer modern etc which font variants are available and what to
substitute or not, is there a bold small caps for this font etc etc...

You may be happy to use \font \foo = something at 10pt and not have any
other size variants available or italic or bold etc until you have found
the internal font names for all such variants but you are in  a tiny
minority.

Most people would rather specify a font family and then have
\large\itshape  select the matching large italic font without needing
dozens of lines of font setup in each document.

for luatex and xetex fontspec does in fact go a long way towards being a
single package for all fonts, as there, finding bold and size variants is
easier as there is information in the font, but even there for larger
families some font-specific setup is useful.

For (pdf)tex there really is no option, the font naming and font
availability is not regular enough: you really have little chance of
automatically finding what optical design sizes are available or
bold/italic variants without having them listed, most usefully as a package
that can simply be called by the end user.

It will *allow* him to use 1000 fonts. But what exactly should he
then do to actually *use* the one specific font family he wants to
use? Read through the 300 page documentation of your AFMPFX to find
the right command combination?

Why should Rolf have to care about the font format? He wants to load
a font family by name and not have to do some research on font
technology first. Why should he have to fight with types like tfm,
vf, pfb, pfa, mf, otf, ttf, ttc?  Has word an "otf fonts" and "ttf
fonts" and "ttc fonts" menu?

No, of course not, because all he will need to know is the name of the 
font that he wants to use.? The documentation (which may run to ten pp 
at most) would be entirely expressed in terms of "the font that you want 
to use", which of course he will express in plain text as (e.g.,) 
"BrushScriptX-Italic" and not via some ridiculous 8+3 naming convention 
that Noah already considered primitive when he was designing the 
lettering for his ark ...

Ideally he would not have to, but unless I am very much mistaken, 
internally there are different routes through which conventional 
(TFM+PK), type-1 (AFM+PFA/B), TTF/OTF fonts and so on are handled, so to 
make the task manageable I envisaged these being split out into separate 
packages.? But of course there is no reason at all why these could not 
then be unified these into one single package called (e.g.,) 
"fonts.sty".? But to address a point from your earlier message :

*/Why/* would it [necessarily] "contain thousands of code lines to setup 
code for hundreds of fonts" ?? Why would it not set up pro-forma code 
for each distinct font format and then use \csname ...\endcsname to 
invoke that factored-out generic code for the particular font(s) that 
Rolf wants to use ?

Well do it. You know so much about the right way to setup font
families that it should be a piece of cake for you to provide some
generic code to use roboto, the brush font and say newtx through one
package. 

But please don't forget that LaTeX user expect commands like \large
\bfseries \scshape \itshape to work without some manual setup in the
document.

And that is exactly where the problem lies.? How is Rolf to know that 
the font which the rest of the world calls "BrushScriptX-Italic" is 
known to TeX as "pbsi" ?? And why /should/ have to know that, and to 
know that for BrushScriptX-Italic he has to use \usepackage ...

whereas for some other font in which he is interested he has to use 
\setmainfont ?? Why (apart from the fact that the functionality does not 
currently exists) can he not just write :

and Everything Will Just Work ?

Plain TeX is neither primitive not sophisticated ? it is just a basic 
macro package layered on exactly the same TeX primitives as is LaTeX.? 
Anything that LaTeX can do, Plain TeX can do ? I would have thought that 
you of all people would have known that.

I look forward to your implementation of fonts.sty. Until
then, I will no longer comment on this thread. And my advice
to others is simple: don't feed the troll.

I find it very sad, Bob, that when a contributor to this list seeks to 
defend the right of LaTeX users to expect a /simple/ way to use the 
font(s) of their choice, you choose to? classify this as "trolling".

I think excellence and simplicity are often contradictory aims.  Fonts
provide a good illustration to this thesis.

There is *nothing* simple in the excellent use of fonts, either in the
traditional typesetting or in the digital one.  Changing fonts is not,
as you write in other messages "as simple as changing a color" (to
tell the truth, the correct use of colors is not simple either).  A
font must be harmonized with other fonts in the document and the
document itself.  When you select a font, you should think about the
other features of the typesetting: baseline distances, paragraphing,
page dimensions, folios, headings & footers, section titles and many
other things.  If you have math or tables, your problems multiply, but
even for a restaurant menu you should be careful lest your work looks
like a ransom note.  In the ideal world a font family should be
accompanied by a package that takes care at least of some of these
things, and be used only through its interface.  Of course a
knowledgeable designer may override the decisions of the package
authors.  For such a person the corresponding TeX commands would be
the least of their troubles.

In the old days of metal type the standard advice to a beginner was,
"Do not try to use all sorts from all the type cases in this room for
your first book.  Take one typeface, learn it inside and out, get a
feeling for it - and only then try another one".

Let us not try to emulate the other systems, which never looked for
excellence.

For many years I set type using lead fonts, which were limited in scope 
--- it cost you money to get enough sorts (sort is a piece of lead type) 
in a particular font in a particular size to typeset the text and design 
that you wanted. The constraints were actually very valuable. For some 
time I was a volunteer at a USA community college that provided printing 
courses for those interested in newspapers, books, ephemera, etc. The 
basic process was to use a computer to create an electronic version of 
the document and then have it printed on a four colour press. The fonts 
available were multitudiness --- whatever was available on the (Mac) 
computer. Students had to spend less than a week doing traditional 
letterpress printing. The general reaction was that the computer systems 
were much easier to use with virtually no constraints on how the result 
would look. A few appreciated that the constraints involved in using 
limited fonts and sizes made them much more aware of how to deal with 
limited resources and forced them to think deeply about what they were 
doing.

I'm inclined to believe that easy access to myriad fonts in myriad sizes 
and styles is not a good thing. You have to work if you want to be 
outside the box.

Thank you for your considered response, Boris.? I do not seek for one 
second to suggest that to use fonts /properly/ (and /advisedly/) is 
trivial.? But that was not my point.? My point was solely that it should 
be /trivial/ to /use /any font listed in the LaTeX font catalogue ? it 
should not require package f for font F, package f' for font F' and so 
on.? There should be a single simple uniform interface that conceals 
from the user all of the complexities that arise from having to support 
multiple fonts in multiple formats, in multiple sizes and variants, and 
so on.? All this, of course, for the LaTeX user ? a plain TeX hacker 
such as myself cannot and should not expect any such spoon feeding :? he 
(or she) is on their own.

Dear Paulo,
getnonfreefonts isn't able to install arbitrary fonts and will never
be. It depends on the support files on CTAN and cannot be extended to
do anything else.

I am not sure I understand what you mean Reinahard. I never mentioned
installation of "arbitrary" fonts. The discussion is about fonts in the
"LaTeX
Font Catalog".

But the part of "... and will never be" left me even more curious. We have
successfully used it to install MTProII and it works like a charms and
contray to other scripts and recipes on the net -- it does not damage you
TL installation.

You would be surprised! Software is the only thing that can do everything.
We place the files in /tmp and point there and it does the cooking.

Not at all. The domain of fonts is completely different. Not to mention that
a LOT of source files and information on the LaTeX Font Catalogue is out
of date and no longer works.

Just to show you, I executed the above commands (everything was already
installed by the default on a plain vanilla TL installation) and I went to
check
a few fonts. The first one I chose

     movieola.tex:! LaTeX Error: File `emerald.sty' not found.

I went to another one:

    luximono.tex:! LaTeX Error: File `luximono.sty' not found.

and then another, and another ....

    gandhiserif.tex:! LaTeX Error: File `gandhi.sty' not found.
    garamondexpertmathdesign.tex:! LaTeX Error: File `garamondx.sty' not
found.
    covington.tex:! LaTeX Error: File `covfonts.sty' not found.

then I gave up ...  it just needs work! Documentation is hard!

There are both Commercial and Free versions. The Free version could
easily be dealt with by "getnonfreefonts".

This is one of the reasons why the XeTeX/LuaTeX font handling is so nice
-- from the point of view of the user -- it leaves your TL tree undisturbed.

This is not really latex specific  except that it all relies on bibtex
format but there are likely many types of authors here who may have
a few links to post. 

I had posted a few times about expanding the bibliography concept to a bill-of-materials
that may be more suitable for some compositions such as DIU projects or more serious works.
This may also have commercial applications for crediting various works as inspiration
to buy something. I have also been working on a script, now a c++ program that
invokes mostly bash utilities called TooBib , to generate a bibtex entry from 
just about any url ( right now this just works with journal articles and similar).
I posted a few early comments on this list and then again on LinkedIn, Academia,edu,
and researchgate( Interestinly google scholar has not indexed it as it has some other
notes I posted on these sites, LinkedIn does not get indexed at all apparently). 

So now I was curious about modern ways to cite people, historically maybe 'personal
communication" which today may be a few links but in reality I'd like
to cite enough info in a bibliogrphy entry so someone could find the specific
"John Doe" easily on the internet or elsewhere. I also am now collecting photographs
from various sources and wanted to credit or add bibliography entries
for these indicating the date and place and photographer and maybe other details.
This looks like a manual effort- I can't find any clues in the jpg files for example.
I guess hitorically people just put a "photo credit" in a caption and the sources
are well enough known not to need much detail. 

In the first case, a link to a user profile on LinkedIn may be enough for TooBib
to extract some self-published personal details. I've got no ideas on the
photographs except extracting a date when the file name indicates one. 
It should not be hard for a phone or camera to insert a name or phone number
depending on the image format  :) Does jpeg allow this? 
In fact, for security reasons this may be a good idea like a water mark :) 

How do people approach these issues or is there a specific source on this?

Thanks.

You misunderstood my question. Obviously the texlive
collections are disjoint from the set of fonts supported by
getnonfreefonts. But in your rant the only positive note was
your praise of getnonfreefonts and I was wondering why you
weren't happy with font installation in texlive.

None of your examples are supported by texlive so it's not
a surprise that they didn't work even in a complete texlive
system.

So I now understand that you're unhappy with installation
of font families *not* in texlive and *not* supported by
getnonfreefonts.  Also not really a surprise.

For example I looked at the emerald package at
https://ctan.org/pkg/emerald. The licence precludes
distribution in texlive. At the CTAN site one can find
a link to a zipped archive of the package which can be
downloaded and unzipped. As explained in the README, the
subdirectories

fonts
tex

should be copied to your personal texmf tree, say ~/texmf:

  cp -R fonts tex ~/texmf

The next instructions in the README are somewhat obsolete.
In current texlive, one updates the file database

  texhash ~/texmf 

and then executes

  updmap-user --enable Map emerald.map

You should then be ready to go with examples. Unfortunately,
there are no source examples in the archive, in particular
for the main documentation file emerald.pdf. Here is a small
example:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{emerald}
\begin{document}
{\ECFMovieola A B C D E}
\end{document}

The command \ECFMovieola comes from emerald.sty.

I admit this is all clumsier than one would like. The
author should have supplied a TDS-compatible tree, should
be keeping the README up to date, and should have supplied
source examples. But CTAN are not willing to enforce such
requirements. Caveat emptor. TeXLive provides dozens of high
quality fonts and getnonfreefonts supports several more. If
you wander away from these, you'll have to learn to cope
with what's available.

The texmf tree you should be disturbing is your personal
tree ~/texmf, not the TeXLive dist tree.

I want to be very clear that I am extremely happy with TerXLive.
TeXlive is a shiny star in the TeX eco-system. I live by it, I work
with it all day long.

I am extremely unhappy with these systems that do not talk to
each other, like, for example, the Font Catalogue saying that
something should work -- while it does not on the best TeX installation
there is.

So I now understand that you're unhappy with installation

Correct. I have I have (more than one) TeX font-developer
that work for me, and when asked to do a font installation,
simply do it incorrectly.

It is not an easy task -- just like installing TeX in mid-90's
was a nightmare -- and needs to be automated and made
transparent to users.

to use and are reading these outdated instruction, and have no idea
of what to do.

And on this situation there are some other 15 to 20 packages.

Of course! But you can see that -- a newcomer cannot.

And that is too bad. We should be willing to re-package a
few things -- because we already do it for a number of
packages and for the easy of use of the fonts.

"getnonfreefonts" has a special place here. It is the best framework
we have for font-installation -- in general. It is capable of installing
the few that they "assume" and a bunch of others  that they do not
assume.

You may have seen Reinhard's e-mail and what he said -- but in
contrast -- we use it all the time to install MTProII, MinionPro, and
several other ones. You just place the files in /tmp and a few mods
will take care of it.

We should invest on that, even if the author has abandoned the
development of his package. We should list the orphan packages
visibly on CTAN, so people that know it could help.

We do a LOT of patches on programs to include them om TeXLive,
just look at "detex". Why not do it  with fonts?

We should make TeX easier to use and a lot of that goes back
to fonts.

If you wander away from these, you'll have to learn to cope

My point is -- the user should not -- if that is a part of the LaTeX
Font Catalogue.

If so, you should suggest it to the maintainer.



I have personally talked to Reinhard about that, but I don't
think he recognizes the difference it can make to a TeX user.

There is this "interpretation" that AFPL  says you are not
allowed to sell anything with it, including a DVD -- and that
is patent erroneous. AFPL forbids you from making money
and running a profit with it, but not for charging the cost...
but there is NO profit in making TeXLive DVS's.

Which is NOT what most of these installations do, including
the ones recommended by getnonfreefonts.

Also not what you do if you trying to build an environment
to be used by several people.

You have now accused me of trolling and Paulo Ney of ranting. Perhaps 
you should step back and ask yourself whether you have an attitude 
problem before posting any further insults.

It seems that https://www.zotero.org/, via https://zbib.org/, already
provides this or similar functionality (and much more besides).

For example I pasted https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12015 into https://zbib.org/.
In Export I then chose Download BibTeX from the dropdown menu. This gave me

@article{jones_kleins_2021,

url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12015},
abstract = {We reinterpret ideas in Klein's paper on transformations [snip]
arise as permutation groups and monodromy groups of degree \$p\$ (an open
problem in group theory).},
urldate = {2021-05-05},
journal = {arXiv:2104.12015 [math]},
author = {Jones, Gareth A. and Zvonkin, Alexander K.},
month = apr,
year = {2021},
note = {arXiv: 2104.12015},

Mathematics - Number Theory, 05C10, 11G32, 11N13, 11N32, 14H57, 20B20,
20B25},
}

It also gave me, via Link to this version, a permanent link to this
bibliography item: https://zbib.org/a310f7062faa4b4bba050ede5de85bf8

By the way, I found you tooBib technical report on

If you look at the font info in the font catalog, then it clearly
says

Part of TEX Live?
Movieola is not part of TEX Live.

Again the font page says

Part of TEX Live?
LuxiMono is not part of TEX Live.


Sorry but this type of test if unfair und nonsense.

fonts have licenses and if you want to use a font without a licence
suitable for texlive, then you will have to pay for it: with time
for the installation and perhaps even with money. If you find this
too bothersome, use miktex with has less restrictions (but won't
support all fonts of the catalog either).

Well I have no idea if the licence of the fonts allow the
integration in getnonfreefonts, but did you actually ever contacted
the maintainer and asked if he can include it and if not why not?

Hi

The topic for tomorrow's TeX Hour is bibliographies for beginners. We're
pleased to welcome Patrick Daly, author of the widely used natbib package.
He'll give us the history of natbib, and answer questions. The focus will
be on the Beginner experience.

The meeting is Thursday 29 April, 6:30 to 7:30pm UK time. The time now in
the UK is at https://www.google.com/search?q=uk+time. The zoom link for the
meeting is
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

The TeX Hour has a monthly cycle for its topics.

First Thursday: Beginners
Second Thursday: Accessibility
Third Thursday: Conversion (eg LaTeX to PDF, LaTeX to HTML, markdown to
LaTeX)
Fourth Thursday: Durable Documents (same outputs give same input across
space and time)
Fifth Thursday: Experiments and Exploration.

We hope later in the month to have a more technical reference management
TeX Hour, either as Conversion or Durable Documents.

Last week's TeX Hour was Experiments and Exploration. As an experiment I
didn't record anything, and then afterwards myself, Arthur Ogawa and
Phillip Helbig stayed on for an extra 4 hours! So it was an after-hours
party of sorts. During that time Arthur and I had some conversations, which
we recorded. Mostly, they give a long view of the history of TeX.

Here's the links.

Arxiv is a good example as it was IIRC hard to get bibtex. There are apparently two routes to getting aritcle bibitex - their
lookup system and the html meta data. Your result apparently contains a journal translation
I will need to add that is not in the current code. The two raw results I got
are below and I would normally just take the first one. Also some notation is a bit
uncommon I would have to translate. These little things do take time to add
but that gives me more flexibility ( note I have added things like download time
and discovery method ). I'm not sure what Zotero does for a non-web-lookup
but I like  my workflow ( copy url, normally hit "up arrow" in the script
window, look at bibtex, maybe edit it, hit uparrow a few more times to add to my
library ). I'll try their web interface on a few examples when I get a chance
and post any interesting comparisons.    Maybe they do a better job
than google scholar :)

Paulo:  If you have a list of "problematic" font packages (not supported by
TeXLive or getnonfreefonts, with inadequate
or obsolete documentation), you should send it to the maintainer of the
Font Catalogue.  Perhaps he will mark them as
"for experts only" or even remove them from the Catalogue.  Keep in mind
that he is the sole maintainer and like everyone else
in the TeX community, an unpaid volunteer.  Thank you for bringing this
issue to our attention.

Bob, I'll do that and take on the chance of making a positive change in the
situation. It is rare that I see a positive
engagement like yours and I'll take full opportunity of it.

From: r.turner at auckland.ac.nz (Rolf Turner)
Date: Thu, 6 May 2021 16:08:23 +1200
Subject: Tex Live and tlmgr.
Message-ID: <20210506160823.36e19c7a@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


I have Tex Live on my system (running Ubuntu 20.04).  I installed Tex
Live some time ago --- tlmgr tells me:

> tlmgr --version
> tlmgr revision 53568 (2020-01-27 19:20:16 +0100)
> tlmgr using installation: /usr/share/texlive
> TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2019

So I thought that perhaps I should update.  I looked for some
instructions on the web, and it seems that I should start with:

> tlmgr option repository http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/
systems/texlive/2019/tlnet-final

(I hope that the foregoing is comprehensible; it is a single line that
is split across two line, at least in my viewer).

Unfortunately this gives an error:

> (running on Debian, switching to user mode!)
> TLPDB: not a directory, not loading: /home/rolf/texmf
> tlmgr: running in usermode, did you call `tlmgr init-usertree'?

It seems that tlmgr thinks I have, or should have, Tex Live installed
in my home directory, and that is not the case.  I have it (and want
it) in /usr/share.  Currently "whereis texlive" tells me

> texlive: /usr/share/texlive

I tried "tlmgr init-usertree --help", and "tlmgr --help", and
came away not much enlightened.  There seems to be some indication that
I should issue the command

    tlmgr --init-usertree <some directory>

but it is not clear to me *what* directory.

Doing "ls" on /usr/share/texlive gives:

> debian/   index.html	LICENSE.TL  readme-html.dir/
> README.usergroups    texmf-dist/ doc.html  LICENSE.CTAN
> README	    readme-txt.dir/   release-texlive.txt  tlpkg/

There is no "texmf" directory, although there is "texmf-dist".
Should I issue the command

   tlmgr --init-usertree /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist

???

Or

   tlmgr --init-usertree /usr/share/texlive

???

Or
   tlmgr --init-usertree /usr/share

???

Or something else entirely???

I hesitate to experiment because I'm afraid that if I get it wrong my
whole Tex Live installation will go to hell in a handcart and I will
lose, for the time being, the capacity to use LaTeX.  I cannot afford
that.

Can anyone set me on the right path?  Eternally grateful.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Hi Rolf,

Download the texlive.iso image from 
http://mirror.aut.ac.nz/CTAN/systems/texlive/Images/

Then mount it, cd to the mounted image, and run the line

sudo ./install-tl

It will ask you to check your default settings (for my needs, it is best 
to let them as they are).

Sit back and have a coffee.

It will create a new tree for 2021, leaving your existing structure in 
place. So remember to change your environment settings as required (in 
~/.profile if you're using bash). The installer will tell you what you 
need there when it is done.

I suggest you choose the mirror above to be your repository. it's quite 
close? ;)

HIH

Alan

PS. I am the official maintainer for that mirror

Hi Rolf,

    > (running on Debian, switching to user mode!)

Evidently you're using the TL that comes with Debian (/usr/share/texlive
..). This is entirely separate from the "upstream" TL distributed by
the user groups (https://tug.org/texlive).

I know nothing about updating the Debian package, but presumably you
already have the latest TL stuff that's available for whatever Debian
version you are running, because Norbert is quite active :) about
keeping Debian as up to date as possible.

    Or something else entirely???

You can install the upstream TL, either from the .iso as Alan suggested
or starting from a small installer, as described on
https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html

    whole Tex Live installation will go to hell in a handcart and I will
    lose, for the time being, the capacity to use LaTeX.  I cannot afford
    that.

By default, the upstream TL will install under /usr/local/texlive and is
*entirely independent* of your distro installation.  Many of us have
myriad TL installations and switch between them merely by changing PATH.
You have to go to some trouble changing default directories and/or
options to create any interference ... --hope this helps, karl.

If Rolf is indeed using Debian's version, he may well be better off
continuing to do so. There are advantages as far as keeping things simple,
unless one really needs the (b)leeding edge.

To update, you'd just use "aptitude update" (or something like
that; I'm more an rpm guy)

Bob,

Here is my full report:

Paulo Ney



I ignore "Font Warnings", for example, stuff like:

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `B1/cmss/bx/n' undefined
LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `LS1/stix2bb/b/it' in size <10.95> not
available
LaTeX Font Warning: Size substitutions with differences
LaTeX Font Warning: Some font shapes were not available, defaults
substituted.
LaTeX Warning: Font shape declaration has incorrect series value `mc'.
Package pbsi Warning: bad encoding; assuming T1..

as well as things like:

pdfTeX warning: pdflatex (file
/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/public/cuprum/Cuprum-Regular.ttf):
glyph `Zdot' not found

which should not really be ignored, but I just want to initially
concentrate on the big-issues only. Here they are:

There are 539 fonts total and 377 of them process fine with pdfLaTeX and 27
that proces fine with XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX -- the rest is pure problems:


---------------------------------
2 give unique errors:

Poiret One:

!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file PoiretOne-Bold-lf-t1--base): Font
PoiretOne-Bold-lf-t1--base at 657 not found
 ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!


Malvern:

! I can't find file `T1fmv.fd'.
l.10 \input T1fmv.fd

Poiret is reported as part of TeXLive and Malvern as not.

---------------------------------
---------------------------------
11 of them give a "Metric (TFM) file not found":

capitalbaseball.tex
computermoderngray.tex
flyspec.tex
hersheyoldenglishfont.tex
necker.tex
ocr-a.tex
pandorasinglepitch.tex
pandora.tex
segmentfont.tex
simfon.tex
slabikar.tex

Some of them are reported AS part of TeXLive and some as NOT part of
TeXLive.

---------------------------------
---------------------------------

19 of them are missing 8 style files: antiqua.sty, covfonts.sty,
emerald.sty, oesch.sty, Play.sty, pvscript.sty, twcal.sty, vicent.sty.

Some of them are reported AS part of TeXLive and some as NOT part of

103 of them are expected to be processed with xeLaTeX or luaLaTeX, but do
not work either because they expect the fonts to be installed, including

Your texlive appears mis-configured, this document works fine for me in
tl2021 (using Asana Math or Asana-Math names)

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{unicode-math}
%\setmathfont{Asana Math}
\setmathfont{Asana-Math}
\begin{document}
$x$
\end{document}

Note that if you are searching for fonts by font name rather than filename
with xelatex then you need to configure fontconfig
to look in the texlive tree, specifically add something like

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
  <dir>/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype</dir>
  <dir>/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype</dir>
</fontconfig>

lualatex should find Asana Math by name out of the box.

The asanamath.tex example downloaded from the catalogue works in lualatex
and xelatex when I try it.
just a warning that bold math is not available:

LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `TU/Asana-Math(0)/b/n' undefined
(Font)              using `TU/Asana-Math(0)/m/n' instead on input line 108.

[2] (./asanamath.aux)

LaTeX Font Warning: Some font shapes were not available, defaults
substituted.

 )
(see the transcript file for additional information)
Output written on asanamath.pdf (2 pages).
Transcript written on asanamath.log.



> Some of them are reported AS part of TeXLive and some as NOT part of
TeXLive.

It would be helpful to filter out all the cases that are documented as not
being in texlive, as in that case clearly the files not being in texlive is
not an error.

>     ---> All of these from a single package: {emerald}
For example these are all documented as not being in texlive.

This is an error in the texlive setup, the map file is not activated
and I reported it. 

For the rest of your list: 

Please invest some time and format this in a sensible way and
include links to the fonts and tex-files. 

If you test with texlive it doesn't make sense to include fonts like
malvern clearly marked as not being part of texlive so remove them
from your list.

Aye, there's the rub.  It seems to be virtually impossible for us
ordinary mortals to configure Tex Live properly.

There are too many possibilities, too many things to adjust, and never
any *real* guidance as to where to begin.

The configuration is described in the quite complete documentation
of texlive 

https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html

But as David wrote, you only need this if you want to use xelatex
and call fonts in the texmf tree by font name. For lualatex and
pdflatex it is not relevant.

Not at all, I hardly ever configure texlive at all.  The fontconfig setting
is documented and only needed if you want to call fonts by name with xetex
from the texlive tree.
It is the only thing I do other than install it and run tlmgr update --all
every now and then.

What are these "many things" that you need to adjust?

It seems that PoiretOne.map hasn't been activated by
texlive. This should be reported to the texlive mail list or
directly to Karl Berry.

That file is in the malvern archive at CTAN. Presumably you
did not install the package properly.

How can anyone analyze these issues if you don't provide the
tex files that caused them?

Please explain what "missing" means. Missing from CTAN,
missing from the archive downloaded from CTAN, missing from
your system after installation, etc.  If a package isn't
in texlive, *you* are responsible for installing it.

Those files are not at CTAN. Why do you think they should be
on your system? As I had already pointed out to you, there
are some minor issues with the installation instructions,
but failure to provide non-existent files isn't one of them.

Your list is mostly useless. You don't provide tex examples
that cause supposed errors and it's impossible to know
whether you've followed the installation procedures
properly.

I stronly suggest you avoid trying to use packages not
in TeXLive until you become more knowledgeable with
installation procedures. Perhaps the Font Catalogue should
mark these packages as "for experts only".

Best,
Bob Tennent

Hi

I'm grateful to Paulo for doing this basic work. It provides a useful
starting point.

Regarding burden of proof, I say that the supplier of the font and
associated resources is responsible for proving that the font works
for them. (The Font Catalog is I think a secondary supplier). Only then
does the user of the font have a responsibility for proving that it's not
working for them.

Consider for example https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/antiqua/. This provides
a PDF sample and its LaTeX source, via the URLs
https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/antiqua/antiqua.pdf
https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/antiqua/antiqua.tex

The Font Catalogue proof that the font works may also require reference to
instructions regarding how to set up the environment.

In my opinion using Github actions is an acceptable way to provide a
reproducible supplier's proof that the font works. There are of course
others.
https://github.com/features/actions

with best regards

Jonathan

There is no antiqua.sty. As the documentation
clearly states, the way to use this font is
\fontfamily{uaq}\selectfont ...

emerald.sty is provided in the archive at CTAN. If the file
is "missing" it's because you didn't install it.

I can't be bothered looking at the rest of your "examples".

RTFM

I don't know how to reconcile these two statements regarding antiqua.sty.
By the way, the properties of the PDF state that the file was created on 9
April 2021.
https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/antiqua/antiqua.pdf

I'd say that Paulo is not at fault for relying on the example
file antiqua.tex in the Font Catalog, as an example of how to use antiqua.

By the way, a search for antiqua.sty produces a 2020 Q + A that mentions a
support file on fontsite.com, that is no longer available.
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/545370/set-font-style-book-antiqua

And the same search produces a 10 year old thread on this problem.
https://tex-live.tug.narkive.com/N52EFlr9/bug-570993-texlive-fonts-extra-antiqua-sty-missing

I hope this helps.

It seems there are (at least) two packages at CTAN that
provide antiqua:

https://www.ctan.org/pkg/urw-antiqua
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/urwvf

The first does not provide an antiqua.sty but the second
does. But if one is using the second, antiqua.sty should not
be "missing" in a correct installation.

Hi David, indeed I went to a new installation and forgot about that piece:

I used to do this in a different way -- executing the commands:

sudo bash
cp $(kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSVAR)/fonts/conf/texlive-fontconfig.conf
/etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive.conf
fc-cache -fsv


and I have 3 quick questions:

Are there real differences between the end up results of your way and this
way?

What is exactly the file to be modified, in the way you suggest?

Is this in TL instructions?

That was going to be my next step on the list.

Ulrike,

What David is recommending is NOT a part of TeXLive documentation.

What is recommended there, buried in Section 3.4.4 of 41 pages of
documentation is:


   1. Copy the texlive-fontconfig.conf ?le to
   /etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive.conf.
   2. Run fc-cache -fsv.

.. but even then several question remain:

1. Is this a "mis-configuration" of my installation?

2. Why is this standard behaviour on Windows and not on Linux?

3. If David's trick works -- I have not been able to make it work yet and I
am waiting on more clarity from him -- this is a completely internal job on
part of TL, so why is it done on Windows and not on Linux?

It's the same except I saved the search with kpsewhich and showed the file
directly.
you can save it in conf.d or in local.conf it makes no difference in this
context. fontconfig
looks in lots of places for its settings at system or individual user level
and as long as it's set somewhere...
I actually deleted one of the three directories in the texlive sample (for
type 1 fonts) which I think is a slight
improvement (I posted to texlive list about that a few weeks ago but it
makes no difference in most cases)

I was just suggesting that you follow the texlive instructions. I just
showed the file to be saved , you showed how you could
find the installed template file to copy, but it makes no difference.

But the list without being filtered in that way is not really any use. It
is just a list saying files that are not supposed to be in texlive, are not
in texlive.

Because by default it is documented that you can not use internal  font
names for files in the texlive tree with xetex unless you configure
fontconfig tolook in texlive.
That is optional but if you are going to post a long list of errors for
fonts not found in texlive when called by name, you should configure your
system so that is supposed to work before doing the tests.



> 2. Why is this standard behaviour on Windows and not on Linux?

windows doesn't use fontconfig so the windows-texlive specific fontconfig
that is distributed with windows can be set up to be optimal for xetex.
fontconfig is the system wide font system on linux and by default
installing texlive does not change the system settings in that way but
leaves it as an option.

see above, that was a misunderstanding, I was just saying the same as the
tl document suggests.

see above.  On linux changing the fontconfig setting changes the fonts
available to all applications on the system.
It is not, on linux, internal to texlive at all, it is configuring the
system font  system.

Well if you want to use xelatex and call font by font name than you
need to configure this and if you didn't do it, it is a
misconfiguration.

windows doesn't use fontconfig, and so the texlive fontconfig
settings affects only texlive applications. 

On linux a change of the fontconfig configuration would affect all
others applications too. 

But if you find this troublesome: Make a friendly feature request
that texlive 2022 should offer an option ...

Ulrike, this is easier said than done.  The installer doesn't know
where fontconfig files are located and deriving it from fc-conflist
isn't sufficient either.  There is no fontconfig directory in the
user's HOME directory by default and the one in /etc is not writable
by mortal users.  The only reliable solution is to give some hints in
the documentation.

Regards,
  Reinhard

That is true but.... How feasible would it be to not configure fontspec to
look in the telive tree and instead use a kpathsearch aliases file?
That was originally because someone was mad enough to name the longtable
package with more than 8 letters but  could we re-write
texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/names/luaotfload-lookup-cache.lua
in that format so kpathsea can find the fonts using their internal font
names?

So your table shows there was just one error in texlive ( Poiret One  , map
files which has already been reported and fixed)

The OCR-A one is an error in the catalog where it says it is in texlive.
The latex package is but the fonts are clearly marked in the ctan catalogue
as having a non-commercial use licence which prevents texlive distribution.

Your "errors" 2,4,5 are not errors at all but simply documented behaviour.
If a font is documented as not being in texlive and you test for it in
texlive and it isn't there that is not an error.


So out of all the fonts in texlive, only one error in the texlive packaging
is reported, and that's fixed in the sources already.

That is, to say the least, a better position than some postings in this
thread have implied.

This is an important issue because releasing such an amount of fonts on a
system is not an unconsequential move. I do remember that a couple of
releases ago, the fc-cache move would break Evince display due to similarly
named, but distinct fonts.

I'd say that the way to find bugs is to encourage people to look for
them.  Therefore I am grateful to Paulo for his effort and the error
found.

David,

Most of the posts on this thread do NOT deal with "errors" but rather with
inconsistent behaviour, with the fact that in the list of examples given,
some of them run and some not in the widest distributed TeX installation
there is.If the fonts are good enough to show up in the catalogue, why they
are not good for TeXLive? Some
 of these work fine on MikTeX.

In almost all (probably all) cases that is because the licences on the
fonts prohibit distribution with texlive.
that is a choice of the font authors. You could ask them to change the
licence conditions, but people are free to distribute their works under any
licence they want,

Being in TeXLive is not the same as running in TeXLive
*without a proper installation*; i.e., following the
installation instructions in the package documentation.

IMO it's better to put the copied .conf in

    /usr/local/etc/fonts

rather than   /etc/fonts   for reasons of "courtesy"
and also because (with some set-ups where /usr/local has its
own filesystem partition) the OS might be rebuilt
before TeXLive is updated.

Sorry, I didn't want to imply that such a feature request would get
a positive answer, only that if one want a change one shouldn't
simply complain but speak with the right people.

But beside this, I think it would help if the installer on linux
would mention that font config should perhaps be changed, or if
there were something about font config in the "post install" section
https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html.

Currently the info is a bit burried in a large documentation.

I suspect using the aliases file can be made to work.

If I take the plain xetex file



\font\asm=["Asana-Math"]\show\asm \asm a

\font\asmb=["Alegreya"]\show\asmb \asmb b


\bye


then by default it will fail.

You can make it work by configuring fontconfig as discussed at length but
you can also make it work
by saving this file  aliases (no extension) in
/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/aliases

Alegreya-Regular.otf Alegreya
Asana-Math.otf Asana-Math
Asana-Math.otf AsanaMath
FreeSerif.ttf FreeSerif
NotoSerif-Regular.ttf NotoSerif



Unfortunately that doesn't allow the asanamath.tex test file from the font
catalogue to run as

\setmainfont{Asana-Math}

seeing no extension only tries fontconfig lookup not kpathsearch so the
alias doesn't get seen but that is probably fixable.

Thank you for pointing this out. Karl has already corrected
it. I'm the maintainer of the PoiretOne package but I failed
to detect that the map file hadn't been enabled in TeXLive
because it was already enabled in my local texmf-config.

These are all symptoms of incomplete installation or
even non-installation. The Usage indications at the Font
Catalogue are instructions for use *after* installation
according to the package documentation.

On May 5th, I asked you as follows:

  If you have a list of "problematic" font packages (not
  supported by TeXLive or getnonfreefonts, with inadequate
  or obsolete documentation), you should send it to the
  maintainer of the Font Catalogue. Perhaps he will mark
  them as "for experts only" or even remove them from the
  Catalogue.

But the "errors" you have reported to texhax are mostly
*your* errors, likely not due to inadequate or obsolete
documentation.

I now think *all* font packages not supported by
TeXLive or getnonfreefonts should be marked as "For
experts only" in the Font Catalogue or even moved into
a separate sub-catalogue. It's clear that TeXLive and
getnonfreefonts have "spoiled" you and likely many others
into mis-interpreting the Usage information in the
Catalogue.

I am not buying that Bob. This is on a vanilla -- perfectly correct --
installation
of TeXLive 21.

The "fc-cache" instructions are buried in Section 3.4.4 of a41-page manual,
that if you decide to read/understand/execute it all it will take you a
week of work.

The fact that the standard recommendation tells you to install ALL of TeX
fonts on
your system is BS -- there are a ton of fonts with the same name and that
has been
known for breaking other tools, like for example, Evince.

I do sincerely hope that some of the ideas ventilated by David pan out.
Making
XeTeX find TeX fonts-by-name should not require installation of all of them
on
your system.

If it works on MikTeX, it should work -- almost -- just as well on TeXLive.
If there is a
problem with "freeware" we should just add it to "getnonfreefonts" which is
our best
framework for font installation. Installation of the Emerald Fontwerks
fonts should be
a one-command, not hours of reading inadequate documentation, installation
and
uncertainties about what you had done to your TeXLive tree.

I think so too, and hopefully Palle is reading some of this.

Paulo:  You're not getting it.  Font packages not *in* TeXLive have to be
installed *on* TeXLive. Read the Readme for any
of the packages you think cause "errors".  The Readme should explain how to
install the package. \usepackage{xxx} if xxx hasn't been installed will
simply produce "xxx.sty missing".
The issue with xetex has nothing to do with this.

Do you actually know if using fonts-by-name works in miktex on
linux?

(windows is not a problem, there it works in texlive too).

Well I don't think so. Imho it wouldn't be so nice to mark fonts
that work perfectly with miktex as "for experts only". 

But one could perhaps move the "not in texlive" info up in the page
so that people stopping after the first few lines see the info
nevertheless.

The statement that "xxx is *not* part of TeXLive" should
be augmented by something like "and on TeXLive has to be
installed from CTAN."

Similarly for packages *not* in MiKTeX.

Paulo: If you don't trust me (author and maintainer of
dozens of font packages), whom would you trust? On TeXLive,
packages not *in* TeXLive have to be installed from CTAN
(unless they're available via getnonfreefonts). On MiKTeX,
packages not in MiKTeX have to be installed from CTAN.
You may not like this but it is a fact. Sorry.

Let me say out-loud: I DO trust you, I always had and most likely will,
indefinitely.
Every piece of advice I have gotten from you have been sharp, on the mark
and
saved me tons.

The point here is that you are fixed on the word "Error" which is what the
LaTeX
runs puts out.  The problem is something completely different -- it is
UX/UI.

No newbie to TeX will read a 41-page post-installation manual and grasp
that they
will need to do an "fc-check" for running the files of the LaTeX Font
Catalogue.

I know -- that is the fact, but it is a sorry state of affairs --
especially for a new user.

Yup! That is a good point. In fact we should mark them as not working

Well imho fonts licence questions aren't easy and I wouldn't be able

Some of these fonts do NOT have any license at all, so they
vacuously satisfy any requirements. Like the empty set is always open and
closed at the same time.

Licenses of supported fonts must allow usage without any restrictions.
getnonfreefonts can only support fonts whose licenses prohibit taking
money for the distribution.

I must admit that the name "getnonfreefonts" is misleading.

Perhaps it would be nice to mark fonts belonging to tlcontrib
(https://contrib.texlive.info/) and instructions for adding
tlcontrib.

That is the case in most fonts here Reinhard. They do NOT have a license,
their authors disappeared and left just the fonts behind.

Legally (and mathematically) if there is no license -- all is satisfied,
all is granted.
So most of these (not all) could go into getnonfreefonts as-is.

The "Emerald Fontwerk" set license does not fit and I'll work on that.

We should change it to:

          get-non-free-as-in-beer-not-free-as-in-speech-fonts

    How feasible would it be to not configure fontspec to

Fontspec just does \font. It can't control how the lookup happens.

    look in the telive tree and instead use a kpathsearch aliases file?

Maybe texfonts.map rather than aliases.

Anyway, FWIW, my reaction is, "not at all feasible". The idea of somehow
discerning the system names of all fonts, and keeping them up to date,
seems ... impossible.  I also fail to see the benefit of going to all
this work. Certainly nothing I'm going to work on.

    texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/names/luaotfload-lookup-cache.lua

If the feature is desired, presumably xetex should support it too. -k

    But beside this, I think it would help if the installer on linux
    would mention that font config should perhaps be changed, or if
    there were something about font config in the "post install" section
    https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html.

I admit I don't agree. TL is perfectly usable without messing with
system fonts, and I don't think the installation should imply otherwise,
which is what making system font stuff more prominent would do.

It's also an error-prone and system-dependent process, exactly the
hardest kind of thing to document. -k

I get that this is what we are following here, but that has no legal ground.
You have to reserve/claim rights to get them.  Just look at books. There
are many authors that have lost copyrights because they have neither
registered or reserved or claimed them.

Paulo:  I've run out of patience.  You're getting LaTeX errors because you
haven't installed the packages. End of story.

I've asked Palle to make several changes to the Font Catalogue to make this
clear to even newbies. But if a user isn't willing to follow installation
instructions, they shouldn't be using those packages.
TeXLive and MiKTeX have plenty of fonts and other packages available with
easy and uniform installation procedures.

The fontconfig issue is only relevant if one is using xelatex on Linux and
fontspec specifications by font-name rather than file-name.
The errors you're getting have nothing to do with that.

Jonathan's idea was to make the fonts accessible to text editors as
well.  That's why he's using fontconfig at all.  There is no such need
for Latin scripts and/or Type 1 fonts but it's definitely helpful for
all these exotic South East Asian scripts he had to use at SIL.  He
gave some demonstrations at various conferences.  In order to make OTF
accessible to any other program than TeX itself a fontconfig setup is
unavoidable.

I understand that poeple prefer calling fonts by fontname rather than
by filename.  But instead of using kpathsea's alias mechanism I could
also imagine a lookup table written in TeX which can be read by
fontspec.  That would probably be a bit slower than the kpathsea
approach but if something goes wrong it could write something useful
to the log file.

After all, lookup tables of any kind are extremely painful unless they
can be generated and updated automatically without much effort.

Regards,
  Reinhard

sure but the relevant table (in any syntax) can be generated from the
existing lualatex font cache, luaotfload has
already done the work of trawling every font in the texlive tree and
mapping the internal names to filenames.

All you need to do is walk over that Lua data and write it to a file in a
suitable syntax.

There is already (Marcel is quick:-) an experimental branch of the
luaotfload-tool git sources with an option to do exactly that.

Not easily usable yet from latex, as fontspec would need to know about it
but already it allows the primitive \font syntax
to use (normalised) font names rather than file names.

Perhaps Off Topic, but for a good cause.

This year I met Jana Schroeder, a blind person forced to change jobs as
part of the social cost of Covid. Her outsider experience of computer
coding training became a wish to make things better. She has applied for a
Holman Prize ($25,000 over a year) to fund this. She's also set up a survey
to reach and know better those with similar wishes.

One simple way to help open to many is to volunteer to be a sighted helper
for a code and math variant of bemyeyes.org. I encourage you to listen to
Jana's pitch for a Holman prize, and if you want to help complete the
survey (whether you're blind or sighted, code or math, young or old). I've
learnt a lot about accessibility from Jana.

Jana Schroeder's Holman pitch (90 seconds):

Would I be right in think that, in the video, Jana is reading braille 
from an extension to her keyboard, which is dynamically refreshed in 
real time so that she just needs to re-traverse to the extreme left to 
start on the next stretch of text ?

Jana is using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refreshable_braille_display.
For more information read
https://wcblind.org/2018/02/what-is-refreshable-braille-anyway/, and then
do an internet search.

By the way, these devices are electro-mechanical and in contact with
fingers. So they need cleaning and sometimes repairs.

Well, I didn't know its name, but it would seem that I guessed its 
functionality correctly.

I find that page rather confusing ? what does it mean by "The black,

Hi

Accessible math is not yet a solved problem. Every day blind persons
encounter problems that could be avoided. Recent progress include MathJax,
lwarp, PreText and work led by Chris Hughes and Volker Sorge. And the LaTeX
team has started a multi-year project to make its PDF output more
accessible.

Tomorrow (Thursday) the TeX Hour will focus on relations between these and
similar projects. The LaTeX project depends on research into how to best
enable math accessibility in PDF. The previously mentioned work is a good
starting point for this research. And using HTML as the platform will allow
an agile and flexible approach that can feed into the PDF standard.

Here's a 2020 blog post from the AMS on automated production of Braille
math textbooks from structured sources that use LaTeX mathematics. It's a
success arising from cooperation between different projects.
https://blogs.ams.org/jmm2020/2020/01/16/152/

The TeX Hour is Thursday 13 May to 7:30pm UK time. The time now in the UK
is at https://www.google.com/search?q=uk+time. The zoom link for the
meeting is
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

At this point I'm hoping only for preliminary discussions, largely
involving TeX Hour regulars. It's important, I think, for the people
wanting and working for accessible math to meet each other regularly. I
hope the TeX Hour can help with this. All are welcome.

Looking back, video of last week is at
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1FZfIX1w7h6fajdTgUOyJ6GYh82b-XQ

Looking forward, next week (20 May) Yihui Xie has kindly agreed to tell us
about his TinyTeX, and to answer questions. This is a small (90Mb)
distribution of TeX, that gives R users all they need to typeset R markdown
documents. It's also available as an R package.
TinyTeX: https://yihui.org/tinytex/
R Markdown: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/

Next week the TeX Hour will run from 6:30 to 8:00pm, and Yihui will arrive
at 8pm. You can also arrive then, if you wish.

This form  https://zbib.org/
is giving me an error on this link, 

https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82352096.pdf

Is there a trick to getting it to work?  If its a real error however they may notice
it and fix it by the time you get there as it should be easy if they do this all the time. 

The reason I tried it is my code was failing due to a botched hack but now works,

}

My validator did not recognize the "upgamma" so I just edited it and it was ok.

I'm almost to the point of developing a language for this as there are several common operations
on the url's or contents. In this case, it has to extract a number to go get the doi and use crossref
The doi is extracted with html and json parsers lol, 
const StrTy doi=
        MutateOnly(StrTy(b),
 StrTy("testHTML --mjmflags 0 -mjm \"")+fnq+"\"  | grep  \"{\" | tail -n 1 | sed -e 's/[^{]*//' | mjsonu.out -cmd \"sax-json\"  | grep \"identifiers=doi\" | head -n 1  | sed -e 's/.*doi://'",out);


I started looking at my code again to try to implement "BoMTex" and a BioTex or similar to find a biography to
cite a specific person ( using info from say a linkedin profile ). For BomTex I may be able to get enough info from the
Amazon product and store pages. Headless chrome seems to work ok for getting the DOM and it uses my credentials
just fine. 






Thanks.

Hi Mike

Regarding https://zbib.org/ you wrote

 I'll try their web interface on a few examples when I get a chance
and post any interesting comparisons.    Maybe they do a better job
than google scholar :)

Thank you for offering to do this. I'd find it useful.

with best regards

Jonathan

It also gives an error for me, both via zbib.org and via the zotero browser
plugin. However, this one works on both zbib.org and the plugin:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12015.pdf

With the plugin I get the error message: This item could not be saved
because Zotero is not open or is unreachable. Please open Zotero and try
again.

I suspect that there is an error, but not the one just reported.

Also getting an error here, I had to fix my code too :)

https://www.nature.com/articles/1600670.pdf?origin=ppub

Nature used to return RIS info that you could convert to bib format.
I'm not sure that works consistently now. I have a bunch of mutate
url hacks but this mutation is slightly different from my list.
I ended up with 3 versions or 4 if you count the cheap html scraper
lol. I also found that the linkedin profiles should be usable with 
headless chrome as there is a json block with enough info to identify
a person in a bibliopgraphy as a source but not sure there is a scholarly
format for that ...

Subject: tpic specials
Message-ID: <20210515061254.uk0Wbn70w%rdtennent@gmail.com>

The musixtex add-on musixvbm.tex replaces font-based beams
by vectorized beams using (for dvi output) tpic specials.
For example, here is a typical sequence of tpic specials,
obtained using dviasm:

          xxx: 'sh 1'
          xxx: 'pa 0 34'

          xxx: 'pa 0 34'
          xxx: 'ip'

These tpic specials at least seem to be supported by dvips
and dvipdfm, but not by any dvi viewer known to me (xdvi,
yap, okular). Are there any dvi viewers that support (at
least) these tpic specials?

Tpic specials are said to be "standard" but I've been unable
to find any documentation. Where can I find it?

Hi,

I remember "dviout" distributed as part of TeX Live win32
supports tpic specials.

Best,

fwiw, there is some ancient converter script in directory

texlive/2021/texmf-dist/doc/tpic2pdftex/

but no idea how to get it into the musixtex workflow.

The package doc says

so it should be easy enough to convert the pdf literals into any of the
current tex engines even if tpic is a bit obscure these days.

tpic is essentially a tex wrapper for groff pic syntax as described by  man
pic  if you have it installed, or online eg at


https://linux.die.net/man/1/pic

This worked on my code but failed on Zotero,

I use an  awful hack but also see below.  
The tmp file is the downloaded pdf.

 cat /tmp/fileik4cLa | strings -n 10 | grep "10" | grep doi
         <dc:identifier>doi:10.4065/79.7.904</dc:identifier>

should know about,

Thanks. The developer of musixvbm sent me the following
link, which provides exactly the documentation of tpic
specials I wanted:

I was curious about researchgate, this took me forever lol.
This failed in zotero web form ( although btw, since updating headless chrome neither the Amazon
or LinkedIn pages will  create a DOM any more and no time to go back and fix it ... ) 

This failed in Zotero,

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7305589_Menadione_is_a_metabolite_of_oral_vitamin_K

There seem to be 3 sources of bibtex entires here but I leave it up to the user to merge for now. I almost
always just take the first one ( don't use "all" option ). I did note though it looks like Zotero changes
the entry name to author and year pattern which may be nice.  For now though I just want a basic entry.
Even if my code failed, I can fix it but I can't go fix Zotero so that would shut me down.

I get this,

This form  https://zbib.org/
is giving me an error on this link,

https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82352096.pdf

Is there a trick to getting it to work?  If its a real error however they may notice
it and fix it by the time you get there as it should be easy if they do this all the time.

The reason I tried it is my code was failing due to a botched hack but now works,

My validator did not recognize the "upgamma" so I just edited it and it was ok.

I'm almost to the point of developing a language for this as there are several common operations
on the url's or contents. In this case, it has to extract a number to go get the doi and use crossref
The doi is extracted with html and json parsers lol,
const StrTy doi=
        MutateOnly(StrTy(b),
 StrTy("testHTML --mjmflags 0 -mjm \"")+fnq+"\"  | grep  \"{\" | tail -n 1 | sed -e 's/[^{]*//' | mjsonu.out -cmd \"sax-json\"  | grep \"identifiers=doi\" | head -n 1  | sed -e 's/.*doi://'",out);


I started looking at my code again to try to implement "BoMTex" and a BioTex or similar to find a biography to
cite a specific person ( using info from say a linkedin profile ). For BomTex I may be able to get enough info from the
Amazon product and store pages. Headless chrome seems to work ok for getting the DOM and it uses my credentials
just fine.






Thanks.

Hi Mike

Regarding https://zbib.org/ you wrote

 I'll try their web interface on a few examples when I get a chance
and post any interesting comparisons.    Maybe they do a better job
than google scholar :)

Thank you for offering to do this. I'd find it useful.

with best regards

I went back to this,

https://zbib.org/

and pasted this link into the blank,

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7305589_Menadione_is_a_metabolite_of_oral_vitamin_K

There was a big red error notice on the page.

This link is useful but the bib entry is a skeleton, 

https://zbib.org/0e5ac456090d4969af45b8b33b4e3619

Bibliography
(Pdf) Menadione is a metabolite of oral vitamin K. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://doi.org/10.1079/BJN20051630

The doi link leads to a page that is probably easier to use for bibtex extraction however.
In fact several ways exist from that page to get a more complete bibtex,
There seem to be 3 unique sources ( cambridge stuff, the meta data, and crossref ),

@article{MenadionemetaboliteHenkThijssen,
abstract = {Phylloquinone is converted into menaquinone-4 and accumulates in extrahepatic tissues. Neither the route nor the function of the conversion is known. One possible metabolic route might be the release of menadione from phylloquinone by catabolic activity. In the present study we explored the presence of menadione in urine and the effect of vitamin K intake on its excretion. Menadione in urine was analysed by HPLC assay with fluorescence detection. Urine from healthy male volunteers was collected before and after administration of a single dose of K vitamins. Basal menadione excretion in non-supplemented subjects (n 6) was 5?4 (sd 3?2) ?g/d. Urinary menadione excretion increased greatly after oral intake of the K vitamins, phylloquinone and menaquinone-4 and -7. This effect was apparent within 1?2h and peaked at about 3h after intake. Amounts of menadione excreted in 24h after vitamin K intake ranged, on a molar basis, from 1 to 5% of the administered dose, indicating that about 5?25% of the ingested K vitamins had been catabolized to menadione. Menadione excretion was not enhanced by phylloquinone administered subcutaneously or by 2?,3?-dihydrophylloquinone administered orally. In archived samples from a depletion/repletion study (Booth et al. (2001)Am J Clin Nutr74, 783?790), urinary menadione excretion mirrored dietary phylloquinone intake. The present study shows that menadione is a catabolic product of K vitamins formed after oral intake. The rapid appearance in urine after oral but not subcutaneous administration suggests that catabolism occurs during intestinal absorption. The observations make it likely that part of the menaquinone-4 in tissues results from uptake and prenylation of circulating menadione},

abstract = {Phylloquinone is converted into menaquinone-4 and accumulates in extrahepatic tissues. Neither the route nor the function of the conversion is known. One possible metabolic route might be the release of menadione from phylloquinone by catabolic activity. In the present study we explored the presence of menadione in urine and the effect of vitamin K intake on its excretion. Menadione in urine was analysed by HPLC assay with fluorescence detection. Urine from healthy male volunteers was collected before and after administration of a single dose of K vitamins. Basal menadione excretion in non-supplemented subjects (n 6) was 5?4 (sd 3?2) ?g/d. Urinary menadione excretion increased greatly after oral intake of the K vitamins, phylloquinone and menaquinone-4 and -7. This effect was apparent within 12h and peaked at about 3h after intake. Amounts of menadione excreted in 24h after vitamin K intake ranged, on a molar basis, from 1 to 5% of the administered dose, indicating that about 525% of the ingested K vitamins had been catabolized to menadione. Menadione excretion was not enhanced by phylloquinone administered subcutaneously or by 2,3-dihydrophylloquinone administered orally. In archived samples from a depletion/repletion study (Booth et al. (2001)Am J Clin Nutr74, 783790), urinary menadione excretion mirrored dietary phylloquinone intake. The present study shows that menadione is a catabolic product of K vitamins formed after oral intake. The rapid appearance in urine after oral but not subcutaneous administration suggests that catabolism occurs during intestinal absorption. The observations make it likely that part of the menaquinone-4 in tissues results from uptake and prenylation of circulating menadione},

Well, I repeated the experiment and reproduced your result. It's only my
successful generation of the associated zbib.org bibliography that prevents
me doubting my previous success.

I'm grateful to you, Mike, for joining me in these investigations. At this
point I think the next step for me is to raise an issue with zotero, and
see what they say.

Well, I know research gate had changed their html not long ago and seems a bit adversarial. I was going to
include a comment on relationship in the entry- intended usage, scraped, adversarial, synthesized etc. 
I've actually even got a flag in some code to add a header in the request admonish_webmaster if their
bibtex is too inacccessible. This was a concen I have had for a while - that is, updating in response
to capricous sites. An "update on fail" or automated failure report would probably be good- I
would have thought Zotero would routinely look at failed look ups and start fixing it
right away.  Having all the logic local is great though and the template is probably
reusable- any time you are hacking something that you expect to be a one-off you can just
add to the hack list in case you need it again :)

Again, I like this c++ code for data structures and logic with the fully accessible bash
utilities and possible dynamic library loads etc. Although right now 
it is probably of most interst to developer-authors.   

Personally I'd like to see all sites including news sites that can make good citations include bib info.
My other interest right now is citing a person with enough of a bib entry to disambiguate the
name and provide some terse relevant biographical information ( city and work or education or notable
publications or whatever )- you may be talking about some other "Bill Gates" lol. 
Perhaps a larger commercial interest for everyone though is BomTex or creating a bill of materials
for the topic of the work that could be the basis for author impact assessment or payments.

Hi

We're pleased to have Yihui Xie as our special guest at the TeX Hour
tomorrow (Thursday 20 May, 7:00 to 8:00pm). Yihui is a major contributor to
R Markdown and the associated TinyTeX.

R is a popular statistics and data analysis programming language. It uses R
Markdown as a single source for many outputs, from HTML and Beamer slides
through to interactive notebooks and LaTeX typeset mathematics. We can
learn a lot from R Markdown.

Note that we start at 7:00pm. The room will be open at 6:30pm as usual, but
Yihui won't be arriving until after 7:00pm. Arrive at 7:00 yourself if you
wish. The UK time now is https://time.is/UK.

The zoom details are:

Meeting ID: 785 5125 5396 Passcode: knuth

Interested? If you have time, you might like to look at:
Authoring Books with R Markdown: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/
TinyTeX - a 100MB subset of TeXLive: https://yihui.org/tinytex/
https://ulyngs.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop-2019/

Advance notice: Next week we'll look at how git can help us improve CTAN,
TeXLive and reproducibility of documents.

Hello,
I am creating a page of shortened lines and want a footline that is
full width (6.5in).  The
footline command is positioned at the beginning of the tex text.   In
fact, the footline command
contains an \hsize6.5in statement but this does not work.   The
footline command is processed
using the shortened width.

How can I postpone the footline evaluation of its hsize statement
until tex creates the footline
output text?

Many thanks in advance.

I don't see that behaviour, Walt ?

Dear TUG,

I have been an individual sustaining member of TUG for over 30 years. In my early days at Villanova University in the 80s and early 90s, I ran a local "Delaware Valley TUG" with monthly meetings during semesters and Anita Schwartz used to attend occasionally when she was active with the national TUG leadership. Barbara Beeton saved me with crucial help on a table of contents macro that I created last century for a triennial general relativity meeting whose monster proceedings I edited since then
http://www34.homepage.villanova.edu/robert.jantzen/mg/procs/index.htm (thanks Barbara!)
We even had a local Tex Wizzard workshop with Stephan Bechtolsheim (ancient history, but Barbara will remember him). Last century of course. Time marches on.

I have been happily using PCTeX all these years, and will continue to do so but it seems like PCTeX has left us in the past two years since I communicated with someone there at the company. Does anyone know what happened to them?
https://www.pctex.com/ website seems abandoned

Is there any other for pay product to replace it?

On my previous work laptop at Villanova University (which for many years was an institutional member) I had managed to install both MikTex and TexnicCenter, the latter interface advised by my TeXpert friend at the university of Rome, but when I tried to put them on my new laptop 2 years ago, I ran into a problem and gave up.

Yesterday a friend emailed me about his friend and collaborator working on publishing unpublished work by a famous physicist, having trouble with MikTex not finding the right folder... but I am NOT a software guy, just a simple user. Nevertheless I downloaded and installed from scratch MikTeX then TexnicCenter and opened the latter to configure it, but it derailed when I had to put in the folder address of the MikTex latex files.

I searched for the MikTex "bin" folder  but found no trace of these new files I downloaded and installed yesterday, and only MikTex 2.9 from 2019, but no "bin" folder. I tried to delete both programs (MikTex appeared in the list from my installation yesterday), but MikTex 2.9 won't be deleted. It reports an error. My university Help Desk also could not delete it, so currently an open Help Desk ticket has been opened for this. TeXworks still will typeset a simple file. Hmm.

My friend in Rome told me exactly the folder address I needed for TeXnicCenter to configure itself


"<folder_where_you_instelled_MikTeX>\miktex\bin\x64\"



(e.g. "C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64\")

Unfortunately such a folder I could not find! He told me TexnicCenter is frozen for 6-7 years already but he still uses it because he prefers the interface. There is also TexWorks for me to try within MikTeX yet but not with the latest MikTex distribution until I can get my help desk to blow away that older distribution. Or maybe it is the latest distribution since my help desk person first upgraded MikTex and then updated it, but the filenames are all dated 2019 two years ago when I failed to successfully configure TeXnicCenter.

Why am I writing this email?

I have been blissfully unaware of how frustrating it can be for a nonexpert to install a free TeX distribution with present resources available. How can TeX expect to survive with such obstacles? What is it that I am missing?

Every year I get a TUG DVD, but my laptop does not have a DVD/CD reader of course...I am guessing that is more for group administrators or computer savvy people?

Why isn't there a self-installing complete setup for Windows LaTeX? Does TeX Live also suffer from these installation procedures which require user input, input that is not clearly specified anywhere?

I don't expect resolution of my local problems, but I would like assurance that ordinary people can install easily a working LaTeX system. I would love to try it myself. I would even pay a reasonable fee.

Thanks for all your years of dedicated work, whoever reads this.

I might try starting over completely and just downloading from
http://www.tug.org/protext/

But perhaps you have tried this? (I can't give you more detailed help,
because I'm a Mac user. But I can't imagine it is harder to start the
Windows version from scratch than it is to start the Mac one.)

Good luck!

Most years I have to help students with installing LaTeX, etc onto their 
PCs (I use a Mac).

As with them, I suggest you go to 
https://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/Images

Download the iso image and mount it onto your computer. This page 
describes what to do:

https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html

Go to the mounted image and run install-tl-windows.exe this will 
probably install TeXWorks but people seem to like TeXStudio 
(https://www.texstudio.org). I have never used PCTeX so can't comment on 
similarities.

Well that is one of the problems. People stick to old, unmaintained
software and then complain when new software no longer fits. 


> I searched for the MikTex "bin" folder  but found no trace of these new files I downloaded and installed yesterday,

Normally you should have something from miktex in your start menu.
You can also try 

   where miktex-pdftex

in a command line window. 

The windows search is normally also quite good at finding files. 

If you installed miktex without admin rights, the files are in your
user folder, normally in 

C:\Users\XXXX\AppData\Local\Programs\MiKTeX
2.9\miktex\bin\x64\miktex-pdftex.exe

Many people install miktex or texlive without any problems. 

You have special problems because you seem to have a special
computer (attached to an university, perhaps with special rights),
you seem to have an old miktex around, and perhaps also another tex
system. 

You will have to find someone local who understand this and can sort
it out.

An external dvd reader costs around 20 euro.

Not possible under Windows 7, Alan, unless additional software is 
installed.? But to Bob :

Pass.? Although I used to pay for TeX back in the Kellerman & Smith 
days, I have not done so since then, and have never paid for a PC 
version.? Many years ago the late, great, Sebastian Rahtz persuaded me 
to switch to TeX Live, and I have never looked back. In the past I would 
use the network installer, or download and burn the ISO, or download and 
mount the ISO, but these days I use Rsynch to fetch the installation 
suite and install from my local copy.? The real problem is that TeX Live 
is not a Windows product ? it is a generic product that has to support 
$2^n+1$ variant operating systems (how many different ways can you spell 
"Linux" ?), and as a result the documentation too has to be generic, 
which is distinctly sub-optimal.

I am certain that together the TeX user community will be able to assist 
you, but some background information will be vital, and it will almost 
certainly take several iterations before we achieve complete success.? 
So, questions :

 1. Exactly which operating system are you running
 2. Are you able to access your computer as am administrator
 3. Do you have fast Internet access from your computer ?? (where "fast"
    => better than 10Mbps) ?

And to my fellow TeX and Windows users ? given that one can install (for 
example) Windows 7 from a USB stick, using the Microsoft Windows USB/DVD 
download tool 
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/download/details.aspx?id=56485>, has 
anyone investigated whether an analogous methodology could be used to 
install TeX Live from a USB stick for people such as Bob who lack a DVD 
reader ?

Have you tried PROTEXT (http://tug.org/protext/).  This is a relatively
easy-to-install package that can be downloaded as a zip file (about 1.1
GB).  It contains Miktex and Texstudio, a GUI for Tex which is currently
being maintained (see https://www.texstudio.org/),  The entire package is
installed with a single setup.exe file.  It can be loaded onto a USB key
and run from there.  I have not installed it recently but there was a time
when I used to distribute it on a DVD to beginners and no one had any
problems installing it.

Further to this discussion, I have now successfully extracted all files 
from the TeX Collection 2021 ISO onto a USB device and am at this 
instant performing a TeX Live 2021 (full) installation from there; I 
will report back once the outcome is known.

Subject: Installing TeX Live on Windows 7, potential problems
Message-ID: <d26e1cdd7df642d286c233db42005a10@nls402.corp.cnl.ca>

UNRESTRICTED / ILLIMIT?E
I see some discussion on Windows install for TeX Live, so I thought I would add something for discussion.

I recently installed TeX Live on a several laptops running Window 7 (Professional).
In both cases, the laptops had lots of ram (max installable on the machine) and included a main drive that was an SSD.
The install was done from an unpacked ISO, so no network was needed (or used) during install.
In fact I shut down internet connection, and completely disabled both firewall and virus checker to make sure they don't interfere.

On the newer, faster system (about 5 years old) the install ran smoothly, although I would like to note that it took many hours to complete (as in more than 2-3).
So a slow, but successful install. No big deal, it runs in the background and the machine can still be used for other purposes while it happens.

On the older, slower system, the install ran for about 3 hours, got perhaps 10-20% complete, and failed.
Tried again and again, but no luck. This same trend also happened with the previous several versions of TeX Live (2019, 2020).
I note that on earlier versions like 2015 the install was definitely faster and successful.
It just seems to be a very very slow install (projected 12+ hours) that ends up stumbling over its own feet saying it can't find or successfully unpack a package.
I even tried the (newer?) "continuation" option on the install and that did not work either.

I really wanted the install on both systems, so I ended up doing the install "manually" on the older machine using the following procedure:

1) Copy the entire C:\texlive area from the successfully installed machine to older machine.
2) Copy the C:\users\...\.texlive2021 area from the newer to the older machine
3) Add C:\texlive\2021\bin\win32 to the path
4) Add shortcut to C:\texlive\2021\bin\win32\texworks.exe to the desktop for convenience.
5) Add dictionaries to the C:\Users\...\.texlive2019\texmf-config\texworks\dictionaries folder by copying across the entire dictionaries folder. (is not there by default, and TexWorks looks for it here).
6) Establish file associations (this would really be the only registry thing for LaTeX other than perhaps some "history" things that happen automatically). For starters, associating .tex with TexWorks seemed to be enough.
7) Establish desired default custom settings in TexWorks like screen font, default dictionary etc. Again more of a convenience thing.

Somewhat unorthodox, but it seems to work just fine.

Anyone else have a similar experience with slower older machines?
Comments on the odd installation method? Did I miss anything?
Any thoughts on why this is necessary?

In any case, I just wanted to document my experience and possible solution if anyone else is having problems.

Estimated time to completion on my Fujitsu Celsius W550 (i7, 16GB, 1TB 
M2 SSD + 32TB disc farm) is around three hours, installing from a 16GB 
USB stick onto which has been unpacked the complete TeX Collection ISO.
USB Device Tree Viewer V3.5.2 shews the USB stick as being connected to 
a USB 2.0 MTT Hub under an Intel(R) USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller.? 
Installing is taking place to the M2 SSD.

In past years, the complete installation would take way less than an hour. Ok, the overall package has grown, but not by a factor of 2x-4x I think.
I somehow get this creepy feeling that the perl unpacker is lagging or something. Hard to tie down.
It just used to me so much faster. Or maybe I'm just getting older? :-)

Hard to know, especially as we are all ageing at the same rate ! 
Unfortunately my installation failed as follows :

... zztex
... 3:00:40
Use of uninitialised value $deftmflocal in string N:/texlive/install-tl 
line 1364.

I am about to try again ...

The offending line reads :

Well, "extract to local disk" is available, so download of ISO and 
installation from unpacked contents thereof is still possible ...

On my Linux machine installation of current TeX Live with binaries for
one platform from a USB-3 stick takes less than 15 minutes.

I cleared the file-system cache before installation to make sure that
data was read from the stick and not from memory.  Install target was
an SSD but installing to a hard drive wouldn't be much slower.

  Reinhard

...and yet when I watch the processes run on Windows, it's so slow I can see each and every one of the individual perl jobs boot, unpack a package, and then go away again. One by one. Is there something in the script that holds things back on Windows?

There is definitely a bug in the installer, but this time it ran to

Hi Guys,

I am running Windows 10 on a 2 year old Dell Latitude laptop (Villanova University issue). My PCTex6.1 typesets my 836 page text on Differential Geometry in about 10 seconds, but requires 3 passes, then I export to PDF maybe 20 seconds and I get a beautiful PDF book BUT the cross-links do not work. Earlier in the decade they would work, now I am stuck unable to update my PDF book with working navigation.

I have no special packages and use only EPS graphics, which I thought was supposed to keep me in the realm of Device Independence Output (am I na?ve?):

\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{amsmath, amsthm, amssymb, amscd}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{hyperref}

I installed ProTeXt and it crashed immediately.

Process started: pdflatex.exe -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode "dgn".tex

Syntax Error: Couldn't read xref table Syntax Warning: PDF file is damaged - attempting to reconstruct xref table...
Syntax Error: Couldn't find trailer dictionary Syntax Error: Couldn't read xref table
pdflatex: major issue: So far, you have not checked for MiKTeX updates.
Process exited with error(s)

So much for ProTeXt.

This is my book:

http://www34.homepage.villanova.edu/robert.jantzen/notes/diffgeom/index.htm
The complete LaTeX source consists of two zipped files here:
http://www34.homepage.villanova.edu/robert.jantzen/notes/diffgeom/texdistribution.htm

This folder contains also the "converted-to-pdf.pdf" image files from using MikTex Texworks or TexnicCenter (I cannot remember any more what I did back in the early teens of this decade):
http://www34.homepage.villanova.edu/robert.jantzen/notes/diffgeom/dgnimagesepspdf.zip

Should I try Tex Live next?

How is this possible? I really don't understand. Also how did you guys get my email shot in the dark at TUG?

Not possible under Windows 7, Alan, unless additional software is installed.  But to Bob :

Is there any other for pay product to replace it?

Pass.  Although I used to pay for TeX back in the Kellerman & Smith days, I have not done so since then, and have never paid for a PC version.  Many years ago the late, great, Sebastian Rahtz persuaded me to switch to TeX Live, and I have never looked back.  In the past I would use the network installer, or download and burn the ISO, or download and mount the ISO, but these days I use Rsynch to fetch the installation suite and install from my local copy.  The real problem is that TeX Live is not a Windows product - it is a generic product that has to support $2^n+1$ variant operating systems (how many different ways can you spell "Linux" ?), and as a result the documentation too has to be generic, which is distinctly sub-optimal.

I am certain that together the TeX user community will be able to assist you, but some background information will be vital, and it will almost certainly take several iterations before we achieve complete success.  So, questions :

  1.  Exactly which operating system are you running
  2.  Are you able to access your computer as am administrator
  3.  Do you have fast Internet access from your computer ?  (where "fast" => better than 10Mbps) ?

And to my fellow TeX and Windows users - given that one can install (for example) Windows 7 from a USB stick, using the Microsoft Windows USB/DVD download tool<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-GB%2Fdownload%2Fdetails.aspx%3Fid%3D56485&data=04%7C01%7Crobert.jantzen%40villanova.edu%7C2fcf14aceb1442445dbf08d91f6f8ecb%7C765a8de5cf9444f09cafae5bf8cfa366%7C0%7C1%7C637575386265687378%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=wWGgs%2BqRQ2x9FBTSobcSIP%2FnJAbExx%2BkmvN2MiuAoMM%3D&reserved=0>, has anyone investigated whether an analogous methodology could be used to install TeX Live from a USB stick for people such as Bob who lack a DVD reader ?

OK, do you have administrator access to that machine ?? Regardless, try 
what I did today in order to install TeX Live 2021 afresh ?

 1. Download the TeX Collection 2021 ISO file from
    http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2021/Images/texcol2021.iso
 2. Extract all files to a new directory (e.g., C:\TeX Collection 2021)
    on your hard disc
 3. Navigate (in Windows Explorer) to C:\TeX Collection 2021
 4. Double-click on files "setup.bat"
 5. When the TeX Collection DVD 2021 GUI launches, tell it that you want
    to "Run TeXLive Setup"; if you have administrator access, then also
    tell it "... as Administrator".
 6. Expect a bug report just after the last package has been installed ?
    this should be non-fatal.
 7. Wait for installation to complete (/circa/ 3 hours), then test and
    report back.

Sorry, I misspelled DifferentialGeometryNotes as dng instead of dgn in haste yesterday. I corrected it to 
http://www34.homepage.villanova.edu/robert.jantzen/notes/diffgeom/dngimages.zip
I did not intend anyone to waste much time on this, but it is frustrating that these different packages fail on me! I do have administrator access to my windows 10 machine.

:D That's not correct though: it's still 'dng'! No worries though, since you explained what was wrong I simply corrected it and got the source.

The file compiled in seconds on TeX Live 2021, with one *apparently*-show-stopping UTF-8 error that I simply clicked 'Return' to bypass (I have not tried to debug). Does this look like it's worked fine? You can find the result at

https://www.dropbox.com/s/v1zvklzaubu8b9j/dgn.pdf?dl=0

I should note, in that pdf I am able to navigate cross-links just fine (I can jump to table-of-contents items, or images, or whatever, by simply clicking the hyperlinks in the document).

My apologies, I thought I had saved it after correcting it, but I saved it again after sending the cache message and then checked the link to make sure it worked.

I appreciate your efforts to help me.

It was not: your "corrected" link still reads 'dngimages' (just look back at the message; you don't have to take my word for it). 

I manually corrected it to 'dgnimages', so I know the cache was not the issue.

No worries.

About the compilation: it was so fast because I had also unpacked the converted-to-pdf images, so those were ready. Without unpacking those the compilation still seems to have worked, but it took just a few seconds longer. In any case, it produces a pdf with working cross-references, as downloadable at the link I provided earlier.

Here, too, is the gzipped and tarred working directory (with the images placed properly in the 'images/' subdirectory, etc.):

https://www.dropbox.com/s/vdke4p8s1kuax75/dgn.tar.gz?dl=0

This is for future reference, in case anyone else wants to try compiling it. What you do is unpack that directory, move in, and (assuming you have TeX Live) run 'pdflatex dgn.tex' a couple of times.

Hi Stuart,

I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your help. I will install TeX Live and try to reproduce your success and let everyone know.

No worries.

About the compilation: it was so fast because I had also unpacked the converted-to-pdf images, so those were ready. Without unpacking those the compilation still seems to have worked, but it took just a few seconds longer. In any case, it produces a pdf with working cross-references, as downloadable at the link I provided earlier.

Here, too, is the gzipped and tarred working directory (with the images placed properly in the 'images/' subdirectory, etc.):

https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fvdke4p8s1kuax75%2Fdgn.tar.gz%3Fdl%3D0&amp;data=04%7C01%7Crobert.jantzen%40villanova.edu%7C7fe7dfbb05e94667aa4608d91fd41ac8%7C765a8de5cf9444f09cafae5bf8cfa366%7C0%7C1%7C637575818113072811%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=VlMZF5Gn76VhiYuo8RVPgz1CXK3Xb9o8Bim6ZommRYU%3D&amp;reserved=0

This is for future reference, in case anyone else wants to try compiling it. What you do is unpack that directory, move in, and (assuming you have TeX Live) run 'pdflatex dgn.tex' a couple of times.

You bet! You'll always find enough computer geeks on these mailing lists who will do this out of sheer curiosity as to whether it works :).

Now, about that UTF-8 error: the complaint is 

Package inputenc Error: Invalid UTF-8 byte "96

In a text editor, viewing the error jumps me to the following passage in your text:

"The spherical harmonics are usually defined with an extra sign $(-1)^m$ called the Condon\226Shortley phase to make the ladder operator formulas simpler."

It's that thing displayed in the source as \226 that's producing the error. I don't know what it was meant to be, but in the pdf I sent you it simply doesn't render: the text appears as the (obviously wrong) merged 'CondonShortley'.

If it was meant to be a dash, maybe just make it a plain minus sign.

Bam! Got it!

Some relevant links on this utf-8 problem are LaTeX2e News Issue 28[0] and this[1] LaTeX stackexchange answer that sent me to [0] in the first place.

Apparently, starting in 2018, special characters entered directly from the keyboard (like that fancy \226 hyphen thing) in documents that do not define an encoding generate an error under pdflatex.

Experiments:

(1) on the command line, run

pdflatex '\UseRawInputEncoding \input' dgn.tex

instead; no error, but no dash produced between 'Condon' and 'Shortley'.

(2) alternatively, add 

\UseRawInputEncoding

as the very first line of dgn.tex. Then just plain 

pdflatex dgn.tex

again doesn't error, bur again doesn't make the dash.

(3) finally, add

\usepackage[cp1252]{inputenc}

right after \documentclass. This time pdflatex will produce a document without erroring *and* render that fancy hyphen.
 
Conclusion: you can't just enter special characters from the keyboard. You need to produce them with TeX commands (like the \'e for accents, etc.) or specify an encoding to pass to inputenc.

Subject: TeX on Windows? [Texlive installed. Now what?]

Hi Philip,

Okay, 3 hours and Texlive was installed. Now what? I nosed around trying to figure out what to do with it, unsuccessfully. Is there some interface to typeset files? I am clueless here. I see this Texlive shell page that means nothing to me.

I thought TeX was an easily accessed program for regular people like myself. I guess I was living in a dream world, with PCTeX as my security blanket. Now ripped from my hands.

I am running Windows 10 on a 2 year old Dell Latitude laptop (Villanova University issue). My PCTex6.1 typesets my 836 page text on Differential Geometry in about 10 seconds, but requires 3 passes, then I export to PDF maybe 20 seconds and I get a beautiful PDF book BUT the cross-links do not work. Earlier in the decade they would work, now I am stuck unable to update my PDF book with working navigation.

OK, do you have administrator access to that machine ?  Regardless, try what I did today in order to install TeX Live 2021 afresh -

  1.  Download the TeX Collection 2021 ISO file from http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/texlive-utah-2021/Images/texcol2021.iso<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fftp.math.utah.edu%2Fpub%2Ftexlive-utah-2021%2FImages%2Ftexcol2021.iso&data=04%7C01%7Crobert.jantzen%40villanova.edu%7Cdfd9d395c6ef41a4d8e408d91fca1d8a%7C765a8de5cf9444f09cafae5bf8cfa366%7C0%7C0%7C637575775198604095%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=ePjP4zPrpTUafIG1IVIqR40yacwctmKiAFTBSmf%2F23o%3D&reserved=0>
  2.  Extract all files to a new directory (e.g., C:\TeX Collection 2021) on your hard disc
  3.  Navigate (in Windows Explorer) to C:\TeX Collection 2021
  4.  Double-click on files "setup.bat"
  5.  When the TeX Collection DVD 2021 GUI launches, tell it that you want to "Run TeXLive Setup"; if you have administrator access, then also tell it "... as Administrator".
  6.  Expect a bug report just after the last package has been installed - this should be non-fatal.
  7.  Wait for installation to complete (circa 3 hours), then test and report back.

No. You can enter special character. But you have to tell the truth
to (pdf)latex about your file encoding. 

Your editor can save files in utf8 and in latin1/cp1252. 

Since 2018 latex assumes that you used utf8 (which is the
recommended file encoding nowadays). If you use something else
you have to tell it with the right inputenc option:

> \usepackage[cp1252]{inputenc}
 
(Actually you always needed that line, if it was missing you were
lucky that you didn't use one of the special chars like ? where is
would have made a difference).

That is rather misleading, You do not need  to use  \UseRawInputEncoding .
You simply need to specify the encoding  that you use, possibly
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
or (better) save the file in UTF-8.

Obviously, "can't" didn't literally mean "are not able to", as you seem to have interpreted it. My message later explicitly says you have to specify the encoding.

So "can't" was short for "can't do it without expecting an error".

Oh, and in case anyone else is wondering about that \226 nonsense: it's an artifact of my text editor (emacs) that it's showing me the octal raw byte:

octal 226 = decimal 150 = en dash[0] in Windows' code page 1252 [1].

Please have a look at my original posting, which contains all of the details.
I disconnected from the internet, and turned off both virus scanner and firewall during install just to be sure this was not the source of the slow install.

Hi Guys!



Okay, I finally got TexWorks working with TexLive! I had already installed it with MikTeX before and it crashed immediately on my book then, but apparently TexLive fixed that problem. I replaced the non-ASCII character for a hyphen that tripped up the typesetting noted by Alan (Philip? Okay I got lost in allt the messages), and put "\protect" in front of \mathbb{R} in a section heading which also derailed the typesetting. Now it typesets flawlessly!



BUT are my previous installations of MikTeX irrelevant to this TeXLive installation? My original MikTeX from 2 years ago will NOT uninstall. Then I tried to install a new version renaming its file location to MikTeX2.9new from MikTeX 2.9, so now there are two. If I delete the new one and eventually my university IT people are successful in deleting MikTeX (I guess I can just leave it), will that affect TexLive? I clearly am clueless about just exactly what TeXLive is, and did not see any plain language description of it. I am guessing they are totally independent:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX_Live



Does anyone know about the bug in uninstalling MikTeX on a windows 10 machine? It reports an error and refuses to uninstall.



Finally, a big thank you to the support you have shown me! When I took a shot in the dark emailing a few addresses at TUG, I had no clue what the support at tug.org<mailto:support at tug.org> email was for or who it went to. I remember texhax from last century when I had been printing it out and keeping them in the late 1980s.



I have a general question. Most of the regular people like me are on either a PC or a Mac, and don't use Linux or Unix like typical TeXperts (my impression). How is it that there is not room in the market for an economical user interface like PCTeX, which apparently has crashed as a company? I have invested nearly 40 years in using TeX, then LaTeX, all this time paying my annual individual membership to TUG because I wanted to give back for what TeX has done for me, even hosting a local Philadelphia Tex Users Group (remember TV Guide? They used to use TeX for the program grids, we even had Stephan Bechtolsheim in for a weekend wizard workshop at their headquarters nearby Villanova) in the late eighties and early nineties, since which I have been blissfully using PCTeX and unaware of the efforts one must go through to have a free installation. When I finished installing TeXLive, I had no idea what to do with it. I stared at the TexLive window, looking for some hint of what next.  Someone on this list had to tell me that TeXWorks was the interface (I already had some experience in the past with that).



So I guess this is goodbye for now, unless anyone has any thoughts on my musings above.



Arrivederci,

bob

PS Notice what our MS Exchange server does to URL's on incoming email at Villanova (scroll down below), totally garbling the actual URL to make it unreadable! To "protect" us. It seems a more enterprising programmer could make a way of showing the actual URL in an HTML formatted incoming email while pointing to the protected garbled URL underneath. Oh well.

Oh, and in case anyone else is wondering about that \226 nonsense: it's an artifact of my text editor (emacs) that it's showing me the octal raw byte:



octal 226 = decimal 150 = en dash[0] in Windows' code page 1252 [1].

Hi

Tomorrow's TeX Hour is about understanding and refactoring TeX Live to make
it more flexible and agile.  The TeX Hour is Thursday 27 May, 6:30 to
7:30pm UK time.

The UK time now is at https://time.is/UK. The zoom details are
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09
Meeting ID: 785 5125 5396
Passcode: knuth

Last week Yihui Xie explained why and how he developed TinyTeX to support
users of R-Markdown. This greatly reduces the barrier to entry to using
TeX. TinyTeX is a 100MB subset of TeXLive. My first PC, bought in 1989 to
run TeX, had a 40MB hard disk (and 2MB of memory and a 10Mhz CPU).

Don Knuth wrote TeX to be archival. To give identical results from
identical inputs. My TeX source file is just one of many inputs. Recording
and exactly reproducing the other inputs is vital, to fully benefit from
the hard work of Don Knuth that made TeX archival.

One goal is to make it much easier to archive all the resources used when a
document is typeset. And at a different time and place, and on a different
machine, gather those resources to typeset the document again. Maybe via
GitHub actions, as part of Continuous Integration.

Another goal is to make it much easier to package a subset of TeX just for
a special purpose. Beginner? You want to make a math presentation? Download
and install a Beamer app. A few minutes later, you're ready to start
authoring.

Interested? Please email me, or come along to the TeX Hour. I welcome your
experience and ideas. My starting point will be statistics from the last
ten years of the TeX Live DVDs.

The video from last week (R Markdown + Tiny TeX: with Yihui Xie) is at:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1FZfIX1w7jotP_oOeQBrs-OvwwO_k3v

with best regards

Jonathan

Hi Robert,

On your general question:

> I have a general question. Most of the regular people like me are on
either a PC or a Mac, and don't use Linux or Unix like typical TeXperts (my
impression). How is it that there is not room in the market for an
economical user interface like PCTeX, which apparently has crashed as a
company?

My impression has been that "most of the regular people on PC or a Mac"
would not need the level of sophistication provided by TeX and use an
alternative solution (such as MS Office). This is definitely the case in
e.g. the life sciences or the humanities.

In the hard sciences / technical writing circles, the developer lifecycle
necessitates certain common tools, such as advanced text editors or IDEs.
Which then in turn leads to large communities who rely on TeX-oriented
plugins in their editors. The "LaTeX Workshop" extension to VSCode for
example, first released in 2016, today reports 1.2 million installations:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop

Another modern trend is moving away from local installation and relying on
web editing services. As the biggest current example, the Overleaf team
reported reaching 6 million users in 2020:
https://www.overleaf.com/blog/reaching-six-million-users-in-an-unprecedented-six-months

The cloud-editing paradigm is much preferred exactly by casual users who do
not feel interested in learning the intricate details of software
installation and "power user" techniques. It is also a paradigm with a
clear business model, and a likely trend to continue in the next decade.

Separately, there are actually tens of support tools for TeX that are
available for use today, each serving a different subcommunity / technology
stack. This (incomplete!) wikipedia article compares 24 of them at the
moment:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors

Whether any of them fits your exact needs or not, the point is that there
is a somewhat high bar for newly built tools to enter the scene. They would
have to put a lot of effort to reach the quality of existing tools, many of
which are free to use, and then would have to justify a price tag that
attracts enough paying users long-term. Not impossible, but also not a
particularly inviting business proposition. I've had some first-person
experience on that end, as a developer for one of the newer projects that
attempted entering this space (Authorea), so my comments are colored
through that experience. That company ended up acquired by Wiley, which
wasn't necessarily our first-choice business outcome at the onset.

Greetings,
Deyan

It shouldn't matter.

No.

Well it is hard to say, if all the info you give is "it reports an
error". Also it is quite unclear in which state your old miktex was,
and what happened after you added a new one. So quite probably
miktex is now as confused as you are.

I'm on windows.

And so what? It can happen all the time that one is confused by
something new. Do you really expect to understand everything
directly without struggling a bit first? The problem was resolved
easily wasn't it? You simply asked and someone told you what to do.

If you don't want to install and maintain a local tex system, use an
online system like overleaf www.overleaf.com. 
Be aware that it can be a bit confusing at the start too, 
but they have a good support crew.

Dear Deyan,

Thanks for the detailed response about TeX interfaces. I have used Overleaf and ShareLaTeX before that and I agree that it is a great tool.

I am a "mathematical physicist" who has a 40 some year career of publishing academic articles in general relativity, where TeX/LaTeX has proved invaluable. I started with TeX at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in 1981 which was a prehistoric era for plain TeX. I did some TeX macro programming before LaTeX came onto the scene and even after with a triennial physics proceedings I edited the past quarter century
http://www34.homepage.villanova.edu/robert.jantzen/mg/procs/index.htm
I still have Stephan's 5 volumes on TeX sitting untouched on the shelf from those days, together with a bunch of other TeX books. I am approaching my own expiration date, so in the next years I will have to toss everything.

So although I read the emails from TUG and scan the issues of TUGBoat, I am more of a clueless bystander now, awakened by this sudden realization of the loss of my trusted tool (PCTeX) at some future date, but certainly for this book project which is just basically a hobby. [I will continue using PCTeX except for the PDF export of my book.]

My thanks again to all of you for coming to my rescue.

Subject: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: TeX on Windows? [success!] [BUT PCTeX?]

Hi Robert,

On your general question:

> I have a general question. Most of the regular people like me are on either a PC or a Mac, and don't use Linux or Unix like typical TeXperts (my impression). How is it that there is not room in the market for an economical user interface like PCTeX, which apparently has crashed as a company?

My impression has been that "most of the regular people on PC or a Mac" would not need the level of sophistication provided by TeX and use an alternative solution (such as MS Office). This is definitely the case in e.g. the life sciences or the humanities.

In the hard sciences / technical writing circles, the developer lifecycle necessitates certain common tools, such as advanced text editors or IDEs. Which then in turn leads to large communities who rely on TeX-oriented plugins in their editors. The "LaTeX Workshop" extension to VSCode for example, first released in 2016, today reports 1.2 million installations:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketplace.visualstudio.com%2Fitems%3FitemName%3DJames-Yu.latex-workshop&data=04%7C01%7Crobert.jantzen%40villanova.edu%7C220389a908f346217c9a08d92064d4a7%7C765a8de5cf9444f09cafae5bf8cfa366%7C0%7C0%7C637576439730817481%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=TaKvsPbysEWVglL8AwvtJOvtQ6hRzK4SvA18EGXZFEw%3D&reserved=0>

Another modern trend is moving away from local installation and relying on web editing services. As the biggest current example, the Overleaf team reported reaching 6 million users in 2020:
https://www.overleaf.com/blog/reaching-six-million-users-in-an-unprecedented-six-months<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2Freaching-six-million-users-in-an-unprecedented-six-months&data=04%7C01%7Crobert.jantzen%40villanova.edu%7C220389a908f346217c9a08d92064d4a7%7C765a8de5cf9444f09cafae5bf8cfa366%7C0%7C0%7C637576439730827442%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=zpWQEQ3jvZi302xu%2FJkpq6dzpRugRNAHE2Qg8W4z1yA%3D&reserved=0>

The cloud-editing paradigm is much preferred exactly by casual users who do not feel interested in learning the intricate details of software installation and "power user" techniques. It is also a paradigm with a clear business model, and a likely trend to continue in the next decade.

Separately, there are actually tens of support tools for TeX that are available for use today, each serving a different subcommunity / technology stack. This (incomplete!) wikipedia article compares 24 of them at the moment:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FComparison_of_TeX_editors&data=04%7C01%7Crobert.jantzen%40villanova.edu%7C220389a908f346217c9a08d92064d4a7%7C765a8de5cf9444f09cafae5bf8cfa366%7C0%7C0%7C637576439730827442%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=ML9cR4Wtvc4P6RkjMDkO5TgQkOAv57Jq0rCFdk7wv2s%3D&reserved=0>

Whether any of them fits your exact needs or not, the point is that there is a somewhat high bar for newly built tools to enter the scene. They would have to put a lot of effort to reach the quality of existing tools, many of which are free to use, and then would have to justify a price tag that attracts enough paying users long-term. Not impossible, but also not a particularly inviting business proposition. I've had some first-person experience on that end, as a developer for one of the newer projects that attempted entering this space (Authorea), so my comments are colored through that experience. That company ended up acquired by Wiley, which wasn't necessarily our first-choice business outcome at the onset.

Greetings,
Deyan

Hi Guys!



Okay, I finally got TexWorks working with TexLive! I had already installed it with MikTeX before and it crashed immediately on my book then, but apparently TexLive fixed that problem. I replaced the non-ASCII character for a hyphen that tripped up the typesetting noted by Alan (Philip? Okay I got lost in allt the messages), and put "\protect" in front of \mathbb{R} in a section heading which also derailed the typesetting. Now it typesets flawlessly!



BUT are my previous installations of MikTeX irrelevant to this TeXLive installation? My original MikTeX from 2 years ago will NOT uninstall. Then I tried to install a new version renaming its file location to MikTeX2.9new from MikTeX 2.9, so now there are two. If I delete the new one and eventually my university IT people are successful in deleting MikTeX (I guess I can just leave it), will that affect TexLive? I clearly am clueless about just exactly what TeXLive is, and did not see any plain language description of it. I am guessing they are totally independent:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX_Live<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTeX_Live&data=04%7C01%7Crobert.jantzen%40villanova.edu%7C220389a908f346217c9a08d92064d4a7%7C765a8de5cf9444f09cafae5bf8cfa366%7C0%7C0%7C637576439730837467%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=sqG6q%2Bg5fS24zyv67%2BL332dpTyNxVwn%2FvM4yrdvgI24%3D&reserved=0>



Does anyone know about the bug in uninstalling MikTeX on a windows 10 machine? It reports an error and refuses to uninstall.



Finally, a big thank you to the support you have shown me! When I took a shot in the dark emailing a few addresses at TUG, I had no clue what the support at tug.org<mailto:support at tug.org> email was for or who it went to. I remember texhax from last century when I had been printing it out and keeping them in the late 1980s.



I have a general question. Most of the regular people like me are on either a PC or a Mac, and don't use Linux or Unix like typical TeXperts (my impression). How is it that there is not room in the market for an economical user interface like PCTeX, which apparently has crashed as a company? I have invested nearly 40 years in using TeX, then LaTeX, all this time paying my annual individual membership to TUG because I wanted to give back for what TeX has done for me, even hosting a local Philadelphia Tex Users Group (remember TV Guide? They used to use TeX for the program grids, we even had Stephan Bechtolsheim in for a weekend wizard workshop at their headquarters nearby Villanova) in the late eighties and early nineties, since which I have been blissfully using PCTeX and unaware of the efforts one must go through to have a free installation. When I finished installing TeXLive, I had no idea what to do with it. I stared at the TexLive window, looking for some hint of what next.  Someone on this list had to tell me that TeXWorks was the interface (I already had some experience in the past with that).



So I guess this is goodbye for now, unless anyone has any thoughts on my musings above.



Arrivederci,

bob

PS Notice what our MS Exchange server does to URL's on incoming email at Villanova (scroll down below), totally garbling the actual URL to make it unreadable! To "protect" us. It seems a more enterprising programmer could make a way of showing the actual URL in an HTML formatted incoming email while pointing to the protected garbled URL underneath. Oh well.

Oh, and in case anyone else is wondering about that \226 nonsense: it's an artifact of my text editor (emacs) that it's showing me the octal raw byte:



octal 226 = decimal 150 = en dash[0] in Windows' code page 1252 [1].

many PC's over the years.  I have given install material to many others and

various places depending on whether you install it as administrator or as a
user.  Have a look at https  miktex.org  faq    uninstall-miktex-win-cli
for instructions.  (you will have to add  slashes etc.).  Incidentally the
protext system  which installs MiKTEX and TexStudio should be on your TUG

Your PATH environmental variable should have your Texlive bin directory in
front of any other tex bun directories.  Your teX live install has probably
done this. If you are worried you can delete any references to Miktex from
your PATH environmental variable.

Hi Philip,

SORRY, I just picked a number from memory, not having actually looked at those 4 Stephan Bechtolsheim volumes this century and being away from my office since March 2020 except for short visits to pick up stuff (online university teaching). It was fun in the early days playing with macro creation, and Stephan was a really clever guy, but LaTeX came along and really solved most of my needs. My apologies also for generating all these emails.

I tried this on Zotero,

https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/29/1001590855/vietnam-detects-new-highly-transmissible-coronavirus-variant

And it came up with this, 

@misc{noauthor_vietnam_nodate,
	title = {Vietnam detects new highly transmissible coronavirus variant},
	url = {https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/29/1001590855/vietnam-detects-new-highly-transmissible-coronavirus-variant},
	abstract = {Vietnam's health ministry announced the discovery of the new variant on Saturday that has characteristics of two other strains. The country is currently dealing with a recent spike in infections.},
	language = {en},
	urldate = {2021-05-30},
	journal = {NPR.org},
}

My code does not handle this at all yet but, until LinkedIn and Amazon started blocking headless chrome
( and I can get pupeeter to work but first I need to get more recent nodejs than in the ubuntu repo ),,
I found that the html parser isolated json blocks with most of the required bibtex entries. The same appears
true for the npr page. It has this for example, which when I get around to it will probably
let me make pretty much full citations ( author date etc ) similar to a printed article, 

 0 html  1 head  2 script  3 (null)    {"@type":"NewsArticle","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"NPR","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/chrome\/npr-logo.jpg"}},"headline":"Vietnam Detects New Highly Transmissible Coronavirus Variant","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/coronavirus-live-updates\/2021\/05\/29\/1001590855\/vietnam-detects-new-highly-transmissible-coronavirus-variant"},"datePublished":"2021-05-29T17:05:40-04:00","dateModified":"2021-05-29T17:05:40-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":["Wynne Davis"]},"description":"Vietnam's health ministry announced the discovery of the new variant on Saturday that has characteristics of two other strains. The country is currently dealing with a recent spike in infections.","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2021\/05\/29\/gettyimages-1232802621-61c88b4e62098fbb10d3c07a5f35903bb2fb74b1.jpg"},"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org"}

Before LinkedIn stopped responding, I had what I thought was a cool way to make a bib entry for a person
that allowed a reader to become familiar with pertienent public info and disambiguate. Was not sure
the Amazon pages will let me implement "bomtex" or bill of materials entries however. 

If you were talking to Zotero you may want to mention this to them. There is probably a lot more
they can do if they get a json parser :)

Well, I know research gate had changed their html not long ago and seems a bit adversarial. I was going to
include a comment on relationship in the entry- intended usage, scraped, adversarial, synthesized etc.
I've actually even got a flag in some code to add a header in the request admonish_webmaster if their
bibtex is too inacccessible. This was a concen I have had for a while - that is, updating in response
to capricous sites. An "update on fail" or automated failure report would probably be good- I
would have thought Zotero would routinely look at failed look ups and start fixing it
right away.  Having all the logic local is great though and the template is probably
reusable- any time you are hacking something that you expect to be a one-off you can just
add to the hack list in case you need it again :)

Again, I like this c++ code for data structures and logic with the fully accessible bash
utilities and possible dynamic library loads etc. Although right now
it is probably of most interst to developer-authors.

Personally I'd like to see all sites including news sites that can make good citations include bib info.
My other interest right now is citing a person with enough of a bib entry to disambiguate the
name and provide some terse relevant biographical information ( city and work or education or notable
publications or whatever )- you may be talking about some other "Bill Gates" lol.
Perhaps a larger commercial interest for everyone though is BomTex or creating a bill of materials
for the topic of the work that could be the basis for author impact assessment or payments.

What you've told me is consistent with my statement, that according to Google search only 4 (now 9 or 10) have been posted to this list so far. (Your results page has no 2021 posts to this list. It would have helped me, if you yourself had noticed that.)

Well, I had no reason to believe that the URL that you supplied would yield a superset of the set of results in which you were interested, and as I had no interest in the content of the results, merely their number, that is what I reported.

Rather than track down what led you to your page, I'd like to tell you how to get my page.

So you believe that "my page" differs from "your page", yet we are both visiting the same URL.  In that case, I would assume a defect in the server if it can serve different results to different clients (but of course Google does that on principle, so perhaps that is what we should both expect).

1.
