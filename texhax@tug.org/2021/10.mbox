Dear TeXers

Today I got from my mailbox TUGboat 42:2.  It is the Proceedings issue,
filled with very interesting conference papers on all things TeX,
interviews, a map of participants' locations and much more.  TUG2021
was a very interesting conference, and the Proceedings issue captured
the atmosphere of this event.

Speaking of the conference, one issue raised at the AGM was the term
length for the directors.  We added a clarification to the guidelines
at https://tug.org/election/guidelines.html:

     The standard length of a director's term is four years. If a
     candidate can foresee not being able to serve for this length of
     time, it is acceptable to announce, at the time of an election,
     running for (say) a two-year stay on the board, so voters can be
     informed.

Well, this issue of TUGboat is done---time to think about submissions
for the next one.  The deadline for that is October 15, but don't
hesitate to send in early!  More info: https://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html.

The month of September had several interesting TeX conferences:
DANTE's Autumn Meeting (Online), Saarbr?cken, Germany, Sept. 18, 2021;
and 15th ConTeXt Meeting, Bassenge, Belgium, Sept. 20-25, 2021.  Among
the coming meetings are

  - TeXConf2021 (Japan, online), November 13,
  https://texconf2021.tumblr.com/
  Deadline for (free) registration: October 9.

  - Grapholinguistics in the 21st Century: From graphemes to knowledge,
  Palaiseau, France, June 8-10, 2022,
  https://grafematik2022.sciencesconf.org/
  Submission deadline: January 10, 2022

On another front, some news for the users of Matrix networks (and those
interested in new chat-like channels). Henri Menke opened a TUG space at
https://matrix.to/#/#tug:matrix.org. Thanks Henri!

Subject: really odd problem extracting bibtex from a science publisher lol,
Message-ID: <SN6PR08MB5582AD747F2A426EA251FD30BEAD9@SN6PR08MB5582.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

I never went to this site before and it looked pretty normal
in the web browser,

https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/o59-099

but when I ran "TooBib" to extract the citation info it looked
like it was stuck in infinte loop. However, the stack trace was 
in html parsing which was supposed to work. I turned out the
html was over 20MB and rendered in lynx with 
89k links lol,

lynx -dump -force-html  junk/xxx | tail -n 100

89557. https://www.linkedin.com/company/canadian-science-publishing
89558. https://www.youtube.com/user/cdnsciencepub?feature=results_main

I'm not sure if my code woould have eventually worked, Zotero web
form returned an error after a little while. But, the doi is in
the link so I just redirect that site to an existing handler
for that case lol. 
 ( this uses the crossref x-bibtex facility which seems to 
consistently drop the journal info, I'm switching to parsing
their json output  but right now it just uses the publisher as the journal
which works sometimes... )

Thanks.  I'm not sure I will use that paper for any work but
just was testing bibtex since I was there :)  Generally 
TooBib is pretty good about finding alternatives but its
single threaded and if one hangs nothing happens. I guess multi-
threaded race would work better and just terminate the others...

I just stopped using the crossref x-bibtex feature and 
got the result below. Apparently they return json, see the "citeurl"
entry, and I already have a json parser but though their x-bibtex
thing worked ok.  It looks like there is a lot of stuff in there but 
I checked it on a retracted paper on nature.com but there
was no indication in the bibtex that the paper had been retracted.

The entire procedure can be carried out in approximately 10 minutes; it is efficient, reproducible, and free from deleterious manipulations. The wet tissue is homogenized with a mixture of chloroform and methanol in such proportions that a miscible system is formed with the water in the tissue. Dilution with chloroform and water separates the homogenate into two layers, the chloroform layer containing all the lipids and the methanolic layer containing all the non-lipids. A purified lipid extract is obtained merely by isolating the chloroform layer. The method has been applied to fish muscle and may easily be adapted to use with other tissues. </jats:p>},

I took the DOI of your sample document and ran it through the script
that queries crossref.org available at

        http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/doi-to-bibtex.sh

and got this:

@article{Bligh_1959,
        doi = {10.1139/o59-099},
        url = {https://doi.org/10.1139/o59-099},
        year = 1959,
        month = {aug},
        publisher = {Canadian Science Publishing},
        volume = {37},
        number = {8},
        pages = {911--917},
        author = {E. G. Bligh and W. J. Dyer},
        title = {A {RAPID} {METHOD} {OF} {TOTAL} {LIPID} {EXTRACTION} {AND} {PURIFICATION}},
        journal = {Canadian Journal of Biochemistry and Physiology}
}

Further processing by bibclean and biborder produces


@Article{Bligh_1959,
  author =       "E. G. Bligh and W. J. Dyer",
  title =        "A {RAPID} {METHOD} {OF} {TOTAL} {LIPID} {EXTRACTION}
                 {AND} {PURIFICATION}",
  journal =      "Canadian Journal of Biochemistry and Physiology",
  volume =       "37",
  number =       "8",
  publisher =    "Canadian Science Publishing",
  pages =        "911--917",

  URL =          "https://doi.org/10.1139/o59-099",
}

I track publications in the Canadian Journal of Mathematics and the
Canadian Mathematical Bulletin, and routinely convert their Web pages
with my software to get BibTeX entries.

See

        http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/canmathbull.bib
        http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/canmathbull.html

        http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/canjmath2020.bib
        http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/canjmath2020.html

[change decade from 2020 to 1940, 1950, ...]

It could be that your sample is similarly formatted in HTML, in which
case, conversion of their publication history might be relatively
straightforward.

Can you be more specific about what you are trying to do with this
journal: is it just a single entry, or everything by one or both of
the authors, or the whole journal?  Its subject matter is out of my
area of interest, so I would not normally convert it.

Subject: Thu 7 Oct: Beginners TeX Hour: How to make a difference in 3 months

Hi

At the TeX Hour we've discussed the beginner's experience over the past 10
months.  Are we ready to make a difference? I think so. The focus of
tomorrow's TeX Hour is what can those who are present do to help beginners
over the next 3 months, 6 months and year.

Date and time: Thursday 7 October, 6.30 to 7.30pm UK time.
UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

Here's a 3 month program, in 4 steps. Briefly it's improving search and
navigation of TeX help and advice.
1. Identify web pages beginners often visit.
2. Improve those pages.
3. Identify good pages for beginners.
4. Add useful links that point to those pages.

Here's an example. The pages at
https://www.logicmatters.net/latex-for-logicians/ are great if you're a
logician (or philosopher) who uses LaTeX. I expect that many beginners
visit https://www.latex-project.org/help. We can suggest that LaTeX help
pages link to latex-for-logicians.

Why stop at logic? There's mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and all
the way through to economics and sociology. I think that in 3 months we
could create a useful LaTeX-for-X resource list. And that would be a good
page for beginners to look at.  And so perhaps we're well set to start the
next 3 months.

We don't have to agree. My program is only a suggestion. All positive
contributions welcome. All contributions listened to. Tomorrow's TeX Hour
is primarily for those who have time and energy to contribute, so that they
can help each other along the way (even if only by sharing experience).

For everyone with TeX projects, or updates, or ideas, they've been
thinking about writing up, now would be an excellent time :). The
deadline for the next TUGboat issue is October 15, though it can slip a
couple days if necessary. We have several excellent (IMHO) articles
submitted already, but more would be very welcome.

I have TeX related projects- BomTex for a "bill of materials" system  derived from a bibliography 
and the TooBib software I keep talking about for discovering possible bibtex sources for a given URL-
but probably can not submit anything meaningful in this timeframe. I was going to download
your template  on the submission info link but was curious if you have a standard way now
to include human and machine readable bibtex info in the PDF files? I had some macro's for
doing that although of course things like source URL are not known ahead of time but that
is where something like TooBib can help edit a bibtex entry. 

In any case, is there a TeX or TuG preferred way to include citation information now?
I like my approach :)

For everyone with TeX projects, or updates, or ideas, they've been
thinking about writing up, now would be an excellent time :). The
deadline for the next TUGboat issue is October 15, though it can slip a
couple days if necessary. We have several excellent (IMHO) articles
submitted already, but more would be very welcome.

Submission info: https://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html

Please repost/publicize this wherever appropriate ... -k

Subject: Accessible TeX Hour: Thu 14 Oct: Potential US gov't grant opportunity
 ($600,000 over 3 years)

Hi

The US Government is likely to announce a grant opportunity whose scope can
include making it easier for teachers, professors, and other professionals
to render math-focused (STEM) educational materials accessible to students
with print disabilities. Also within scope is improving the experience of
visually impaired programmers.

The government expects to fund seven projects for three years each at
~$200,000 a year, per project.  The estimated start date is September 2022.
This week's special guest is Steve Jacobs (President of the IDEAL Group).
Steve has much experience with US Government-funded projects, from
inception to application to development to completion.

Date: Thursday 14 October.
DC time 1:30 to 2:30pm. DC time now: https://time.is/DC.
UK time 6.30 to 7.30pm. UK time now: https://time.is/UK.
Zoom URL:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

The purpose of this week's Accessible TeX Hour is to bring together all
those interested in contributing to and benefitting from such a grant,
whether via IDEAL Group or otherwise. A mailing list or forum might be an
immediate outcome from this meeting.

This Forecast Opportunity can be found on grants.gov by searching for
Opportunity Number HHS-2022-ACL-NIDILRR-IFDV-0007.

Finally, the key passage from the grant opportunity forecast. Warning -
it's a bit long and written in a technical language.

Here goes with the key passage: The purpose of the Field Initiated Projects
program is to generate new knowledge through research or to develop
methods, procedures, and rehabilitation technologies that maximize the full
inclusion and integration into society, employment, independent living,
family support, and economic and self-sufficiency of people with
disabilities, especially people with the highest support needs. In carrying
out a development activity under a Field Initiated Projects development
grant, a grantee must use knowledge and understanding gained from research
to create materials, devices, systems, methods, measures, techniques,
tools, prototypes, processes, or intervention protocols that are beneficial
to the target population.

Thank you for reading to the end.

with kind regards

Jonathan

Hi Mike,

Oops, I guess I haven't released it at all yet :). I jumped the gun on
updating the template. I'll make an ltugboat package release shortly.

It's not important for writing, though. Can just be replaced with \url.

    But there is no indication it put any useful citation info 

\tbsurl is not related to citations, in the bibtex/bibliography sense.
\tbsurl{foo.com/bar} is simply an abbreviation for https://foo.com/bar.

    I have TeX related projects- BomTex for a "bill of materials" system
    derived from a bibliography and the TooBib software I keep talking
    about for discovering possible bibtex sources for a given URL- but
    probably can not submit anything meaningful in this timeframe. 

Sure, I knew I was writing late in the day.
Maybe for the next issue, deadline March 31 2022 ...

    I was going to download your template on the submission info link
    but was curious if you have a standard way now to include human and
    machine readable bibtex info in the PDF files? 

If you mean as a PDF attachment or some such, no, we have no explicit
support for that, though a (very) few articles have used it, over the
years, mostly for source code examples, as I recall.

My experience is that hardly anyone (including me) uses or even notices
PDF attachments.  I don't have anything against them, but I think it's
more usable to (also, at least) link to any such resources externally.

    In any case, is there a TeX or TuG preferred way to include citation
    information now?  

Not in the sense of attachments. At least not as far as I
know. Certainly nothing for TUGboat.

    I like my approach :)

Sounds like a fine thing to write about, then :). --thanks, karl.

The ltugboat release that defined this was actually 2.23, of 2020-03-12.
I was checking the wrong file before, and the upcoming release for today
improves the macro, so I got confused.

By the way, my thanks to Ulrike Fischer for providing the significant
code for \tbsurl and \tbhurl. \hyper at normalise was not part of my
consciousness :). --best, karl.

Thanks. I'm not sure what you mean by " pdf attachment" and maybe tried to
relate the distinct topics I put in my post. The url thing was just a distraction 
but my quesiton concerns including information in a compiled latex document,
typically pdf, so that someone wishing to cite the document could extract
bibtex the document as much as is practical.  When I  release  a technical
report draft  for example,  there is usually a print suggested bibtex in an appendix
and similar information in the extended information.  I'm using
a suggested bibtex I picked from a random website when I was just getting
started and actually do not like it at all lol but it does work. The latex
uses this thing called "mjmaddbib"  producing the extended info shown
below. It may not know what server it is on and may need to be updated
with a "retracted" status but works as a good start for another author
to use.  BomTex is a bit different in that it hopes to create
better tracking for which source documents generate traffic to other sites
( and sales ) based on clicking on links in the bibliography.

It would be very odd I think in a multi-article format like tugboat if
each article had a visible bibtex entry printed within the document.
There is separately Nelson Beebe's bibtex file for tugboat going back
to the start of time

http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/tugboat.html

Certainly the printed and machine readable part need to be appropriate 
for the documents- an entire book or journal is different and a short
article with printed formated bibtex may be a bit odd looking. 
See below.

Yes, I've got that link already open in response to
a prior message,

https://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2021-August/025302.html

and I still have not added this special case to TooBib yet

However, the general problem of easily citing a given
pdf or other file remains open. I guess documents could
have a single " for citing information see [ link ]" 
line that is acceptable to the reader and also in
the extended information. In the absence of a cooperating
server the known information could be inserted in 
machine readable form. Is there a latex pacakge or
agreed upon way to do that? 

You do raise a good point however about citing hierarchial
documents. I guess with html there is a fragment concept,  

https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Fragment.html   

if you were viewing a collection web page and could find the fragment 
for the abstract or paper you with to cite that would let software
sort out the specific document of interest.

While we are on this, PDF AFAICT also does not have a means to 
put a "referer" header in a request when clicking on a link.
So, if I'm reading a document and click on a link in the bibliography
( which is typically to another document cited by the author
but with BomTex could be to a product manufacturer or "advertiser"
) the target server is not away of the document generating the interest
unless a docuement idetentifier is encoded in the request url ( typically
a query string ).  
Am I wrong about this or is there an easy way to track user actions
in response to a given work?

The DOI is the common solution but for publications like this it
is difficult to get a DOI for each one. The server side code
to just let people upload DOI info is probably trivial. I guess
you could come up with a scheme just to have more
DOI-esque servers and a means to point a user from the document
he wants to cite to the bibtex URL. Multi-document documents
like journals or newspapers etc could use fragments or similar
to generate a specific URL for each citable entity. The workflow
them is for the would-be author to copy the bibtex URL to
the clip board and run some code to go get the bibtex.

This may sound dumb, maybe there is an alternative, but
I'm trying to get latex to read a file that it then ignores so that
my packaging script can see that latex needs it and archive it with
the release document latex produces. The immediate problem is
to include an "R" script. If mjmtol in the code below  uses #1, 
then xxx.R is picked up
as required by latex but with the definition below it never
seems to read it. Is there some simple way to do this?
Thanks. 

\newcommand{\mjmtol}[1] {}

\mjmtol{
\verbatiminput{xxx.R}
}

do you need to input it at all, if you just access it with `\openin`
or a latex wrapper such as

`\IfFileExists{testfile}{}{}`

if you use `pdflatex --recorder` that is enough for the file access to
be listed.

It seems to prompt for xxx.R if it does not exist but nothing in the
latex output. However, it looks like the reorder flag generates an fls file 
which contains the "R" file twice so I can use that. Thanks.
iIt looks like the first one-liner is sufficient ...

`\IfFileExists{xxx.R}{}{}`

\newread\foodoo
\openin\foodoo=xxx.R
\read\foodoo to\dohdoh

 pdflatex --recorder spicey | grep R

Thanks, I had tried catchfile before but that did not
immediately work although I use it elsewhere.
The "--recorder" flag seems to help.

Here is a link that turns up  on google scholar, 

https://www.ijvsbt.org/index.php/journal/article/download/1386/1058

It has a doi in it but a scraper would be hard pressed to find it. Zotero did
not find it and I did not find it. It turns out however, that the url
can be modified to find the bibtex but this is harder with a local file
and no URL info. I got my code to work as another special
case. However, it would be nice if there was some simplicity and
uniformity to the process especially for works with no DOI.

What objections would there be to just including machine readable 
citation info in a PDF file? Absent that, a domain specific document
number and look up facility? lol.

The link is to a PDF file that absolutely does NOT contain any DOI numbers.

The scrapper I use which is a half-an-hour job on BeatifulSoup finds a
candidate
to DOI in the string:

        10.21887/ijvsbt.17.1.24

by validation marks it as non-valid DOI on 2021-10-20-03:03:28 UTC.

I was wondering what do you think is a DOI in this document. Our script
thinks
there are none and a quick check confirms that.

We all know that if you start with a false-premise in math you can prove
anything
you want, so it is essential to start with something that is valid.

Our scrapper knows the rules for finding DOIs in some 500 math journals. We
used to
have that many rules and they were numbered rule-1, rule-2, .... we have
now merged
them into about 50, and they are named: rule-springer, rule-elsevier,
rule-ams, ... and
it is becoming a bit more manageable.

It is very hard to even come up with a rule -- for a journal --  since
there are journals
with certain rules for years under JStor and another set of rules for
years-published
under somebody else.

The only solution here will be to associate a unique identifier (ISSN +
Year) to a set
of well-defined rules.... but we need first to define the language that
describes these rules.

Try! I'll give you the database of the managers of some 2000 math journals
and you
can try asking them ...

What is your final determination on the "doi" below ?

Creating a regex or something to find as you say candidates is not hard
but finding the right thing is well a big hack.

I did not bother to run it but the thing that looks like a doi,
maybe you can find it in the  PDF with a regex, is listed in the
cite's bibtex as the doi for the document,

doi = {10.21887/ijvsbt.17.1.24},

I was going to start with TUG :) And with neomutt its easy to send out
dear colleague letters :) 

Although I'm curious now how TooBib would do on some of them applying
the rules it has now....

Subject: TooBib vs Zotero - citing a Walmart product page  fwiw 
Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB5571C4E274C48867CDFF779ABE819@BN7PR08MB5571.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

https://www.walmart.com/ip/Swanson-Thyroid-Glandular-Thryroxin-Free-Formula-200-mg-60-Caps/890335711

I've been talking about this for years now and it has been a low priority as I'm sure many academic
authors can understand :) However, it is interesting looking forward to a Bill-Of-Materials - Tex to
see what sites provide for useful info. Zotero worked well in that it provided 
a minimal accurate "misc" entry, 


@misc{noauthor_swanson_nodate,
	title = {Swanson thyroid glandular - thryroxin-free formula 200 mg 60 caps},
	url = {https://www.walmart.com/ip/Swanson-Thyroid-Glandular-Thryroxin-Free-Formula-200-mg-60-Caps/890335711},
	abstract = {Buy Swanson Thyroid Glandular - Thryroxin-Free Formula 200 mg 60 Caps at Walmart.com},
	language = {en},
	urldate = {2021-10-23},
	journal = {Walmart.com},
}


But I've been doing better grabbing whatever the publisher puts up there. This is also
a real odd site as mostly the "og:" meta data is very limited but according to my output most
of this came from that here.  I do coerce the entry into an "article" but the "type" of "product.item"
is provided by the site. Zotero picked up the domain as the journal but I indicated it as the publisher
too. If you have to manually edit these things, it is easier to delete or modify a line than create
a new one.

Subject: unwanted space after a command
Message-ID: <72C384B2-9B6D-4387-8E5F-D897303FEF83@psu.edu>

Hi,

I have defined several commands that look like:

\providecommand{\fn}[1]{\textcolor{DarkOrange3}{\texttt{\detokenize{#1}}}}

to use when entering computer code in documents for the classes I teach. I like the command because it allows me to put underscores or anything else I need in it. The command works nicely if I do something like:

\fn{legendreP(n,x)}

but if I have a backslash in the command, an extra space is added after the command. For example, with

\fn{w = A\b}.

there is a space between the "b" and the period. How can I define a command like this that doesn't add that extra space?

Thank you!

e. g.,

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{color}
\providecommand{\fn}[1]{\textcolor{red}{\texttt{\detokenize{#1}\unskip}}}
\begin{document}
\fn{legendreP(n,x)}
\fn{w = A\b}.
\end{document}

...but not checked what's the cause of the space, in \detokenize.

Title:  A brief introduction to Portable TeX Documents
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

To whet your appetite here's the anonymous reviewer feedback.

1. A focused solution that has the potential to work for many ecosystems.
2. I like the fact that this talk takes problems from a less widely known
ecosystem and tries to generalize it. I'd recommend the author to focus on
the packaging aspect, using TeX as a showcase, with its own specificity.
3. I like the combination of relevant technologies.
4. Very interesting work on Portable TeX Documents. Highly recommend that
this talk be a part of the conference.
5. This is relevant to me as someone who maintains multiple hundred-page
technical documents for multiple organizations. However, it may be too
specific to its target ecosystem to be adequately relevant for PackagingCon
this time around.

Here's the 26 August TeX Hour which first introduced the idea of Portable
TeX Documents
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1FZfIX1w7gcm6b4MzRKDIlW7xV4yFnd

Last week's TeX Hour was Accessible TeX rendering and R-Markdown. It will
be available tomorrow morning UK time at
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1FZfIX1w7jDYlhuKEv9jwghokCweLn_

Here's my version of the shared conclusions from last week's TeX Hour.
===
BACKGROUND
The key to accessibility is generating from one source document multiple
outputs, diverse enough to give all access to the information in the source
document.

DEFINITION
A TeX author is anyone whose output includes TeX generated PDF.

GOAL
All TeX authors generate accessible outputs.

PLAN
Use R Markdown as a model to follow, adapting as required.

PROBLEM
Markdown not adequate for majority of technical LaTeX documents.
===

Happy TeXing

Message-ID: <CA+9ODgsbTjtPj8fk0U+H_Ui5mqQBD_9FTkJ14X3zTG_RyeX9sA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi TeXhax

I am writing document specifications
for a book I'm working on.

I have seen a figure that describes
the page layout explanation I'm looking for.

* A Guide to LaTeX, 3e, Kopka & Daly
pg 555, Figure G.1: Single column page format

* Reference Manual, layout_e.pdf
pg 14, Figure 1: page layout

While I have layout_e.tex in my distribution:

C:\program-files\texlive\2021\texmf-dist\doc\latex\refman

at the point where the figure appears

\input lay_e2

which file is not available.

Here are images of what I'm looking for.

Q: Is this figure in a package?

see the layout package part of the core latex tools distribution page 2 has
more or less the diagram you are looking for I think

Message-ID: <20211030170152.GJ26935@engels.histomat.net>

I need to construct a symbol, but worry about its falling apart or 
becoming distorted when published.

The symbol is a circle enclosing a centered "N" and is attached to an arrow 
 pointing right: 

{\footnotesize{N}}$\kern -0.785em \bigcirc\kern  -0.4em\longrightarrow$

Can this  be done in a way that is simpler or is more stable?

As you have not specified the font in which this sequence is to occur, 
your two \kerns, expressed in ems, are unlikely to reliably work as 
intended.? Apart from a well-intentioned desire for portability, is 
there any reason why your definition cannot also include font family, 
size, variant, etc ?

If you want to retain font independence, you could perhaps measure the 
dimensions of your \footnotesize {N}, \bigcirc and \longrightarrow and 
then calculate your \kerns accordingly, \raise-ing if required..

Before assembling such a symbol it's advisable to check whether there
is a font which already contains this symbol:

  texdoc symbols-a4

Searching 422 pages takes some time but using a symbol provided by a
font is the most robust solution.

BTW, IMO it's quite strange if a publisher changes the font without
consulting the author.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thanks, you are a bit help. I was presuming monospace. If I'm not 
wrong, the size of a kern depends on the em unit, which in turn 
depends on the font currently in use. So to gain portability I 
suppose I should specify a monospace font. For example:

{\footnotesize{N}}$\kern -0.767em \bigcirc\kern -0.4em\rightarrow$

I hope this makes the symbol portable, but I worry abou the \footnotesize. 
If \ regular, \small, \footnote size are based on a percentrage, I suppose
there is no problem. But am unsure.

Herbert. I like it! One problem is that if I compiile with pdflatex to 
get a pdf or with latex to get a dvi file, the results differ. In the 
dvi file the N breaks through the top of the circle a little. In the 
pdf the N is a bit high, but not so much as to near hi\igging the 
cirfle. When I put the code into a document I happen to be currently 
writing, the N is a bit too low. How is the mu unit measured for /mkern? 
Is it a function of the current font? If so I'll have to specify a 
monospace font

Any idea why the zotero web form fails here? Or can anyone get it to work?
This looked pretty straight forward but a lot of these sites are
picky about user agents, rejecting even headless chrome but ok with wget lol.

Toobib seems to work ok here, and I stopped using the crossref bibtex which is
missing a lot of cool stuff that their json returns. Note the "citeurl" lacks
the request for bibtex conversion.

1mu = 1/18em

You can use \raisebox for the N for a better position.

Hi,

could it be that the difference between pdf and dvi stems from the
\scalebox macro? My knowledge about that is rather rusty. Could it be
that \scalebox useds ps/pdf features most dvi viewers do not support,
and thus has no effect on the output of the dvi viewer?

HTH,
Julius

What are you using for viewers? I doubt I can help but in the past I had
to dig through the dvi interpretter in evince and I've been fighting
other issues with svg so I have some interest.

Yes, a lot of DVI viewers cannot show rotations and scalings.
