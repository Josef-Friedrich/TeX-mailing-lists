I suggest you first consult the guidance available on this page: https://www.tug.org/texlive/pkginstall.html

If you fall into the first situation the only way to get an updated version would be to upgrade your Ubuntu install.  There?s already been a Long Term Support release made in April 2020 and one is currently in process for April 2022.  That makes your installed version supported but old.  A tutorial on upgrading an installed Ubuntu desktop can be found here: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/upgrading-ubuntu-desktop

Hi

This is the last TeX Hour announcement for this year.

Each new year is an opportunity for review, change and renewal. And next
month the TeX Hour starts its second year. This month there'll be 4
meetings where we'll look both backwards and forwards. In January I'll be
making some wishes and suggestions for 2022.

All meetings are Thursday 6:30 to 7:30pm UK(=GMT) time. UK time now:
https://time.is/UK.
The URL is:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/78551255396?pwd=cHdJN0pTTXRlRCtSd1lCTHpuWmNIUT09

The calendar for this month is:

Thu 2 Dec: Beginners
Thu 9 Dec: Accessibility
Thu 16 Dec: Conversions (and Community)
Thu 23 Dec: \relax  and Happy Holidays (no meeting)
Thu 30 Dec: Open House - all topics welcome

Each week I'd like to take a long view, going back to 1980 and forward to
2040. Well, that's quite something, and my crystal ball is more like a snow
globe. By the way, the snow globe dates back to about 1900, see: The family
company that invented the snow globe:
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25298507

Here's something to think about. TeX has excellence in typography. But it
has a rival. Searching for typography (on google) gives
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography as the first result. That's fair.
But who comes second?

It's the typography page for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design,
which is "a design language developed by Google in 2014" whose focus is
best practices in user interface design and user experience (UX). Dave
Crossland is known to many in our community as an open source fonts
expert, with graphic design skills. For the last 5 years he's worked for
Google, lately with a focus on UX Programs and Operations lead.

By the way, tomorrow the backlog will be cleared, and past videos can be
seen at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmCKEgzdM6fTYtfivRdzajw/playlists

If I don't see you before, Happy Holidays and best wishes for the New Year.

Happy TeXing for 2022

It is fairly simple, if you use TexLive from a linux dist tlmgr can only be used for certain configuration tasks.

tlmgr from a Linux dist cannot be used for package update, package installation or updating tlmgr itself.

The Linux dists wants you to get updates and install latex packages through their package system, not through tlmgr.

The fact that the linux dist does not update latex packages is unfortunate.

For linux I personally always use the upstream TeXLive from tug.org/texlive, which has a fully functional tlmgr.

Subject: psfonts.map not found
Message-ID: <YapmspDgIOlGaUp1@histomat.net>

I built a new machine and copied fonts over to their original 
locations. I registered the fonts and ran $ texhash. 

No problem with the old machine, but when I try now to run PDFLaTeX 
on a .tex file on the new machine I get this errror:

kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+120/600 --dpi 720 ptmb8r
gsftopk: fatal: map file `psfonts.map' not found.
mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for ptmb8r.
mktexpk: perhaps ptmb8r is missing from the map file.
kpathsea: Appending font creation commands to missfont.log.
(see the transcript file for additional information)
!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file ptmb8r): Font ptmb8r at 720 not found
 ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

Does this mean that the only map missing is that for the ptmb8r font? 
This seems to be Adobe Times Roman. I thought this worked out of the 
box. In any case I don't use Times Roman but instead mathptmx.

Also installed is textgreek, tipa, mathrsfs, amsmath, amssymb, 
phonetic, arabtex, CJKitf8, wasysym.

 CTAN
Message-ID: <202112040237.1B42bSCj006504@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers!

The late autumn and winter is a holiday season for many of us.  While
this tradition is now adopted by almost all religions and secular
people, it is much older and is probably associated with the
agricultural rhythms in the Northern hemisphere.  I congratulate the
TUG members and other TeXers for the holidays, and wish us all a
merry season and a safe and fruitful year.

Speaking of seasonal gifts, we just received the new issue of TUGboat
(42:3, https://tug.org/TUGboat). It is full of very interesting papers
on all things TeX and typography related - from a long essay by Charles
Bigelow on form, pattern and texture in the typographical image to a
cartoon by John Atkinson and a new unit for LuaMetaTeX based on a joke
by (then) 19-year-old Knuth. Several papers discuss multilingual
processing, including the long-awaited package (created by Frank
Mittelbach) to typeset font tables for large Unicode fonts:
https://ctan.org/pkg/unicodefonttable.

Another piece in TUGboat is the latest LaTeX news, with the description
of the second update to LaTeX released in 2021 (version of 2021-11-15).

In addition, the previous TUGboat issue, 42:2 (the TUG'21 conference
proceedings), is now fully public: https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb42-2/

The season is not only a cause for celebration, but also an occasion
to remember those who are, unfortunately, no longer with us.  Sadly,
in the recent issue of TUGboat there are several obituaries for the
people we recently lost: Walter Schmidt, Chuck Geschke,
Rog\'erio Brito, Michael Spivak.  These people left a lasting imprint
in our community.

In my column in TUB 42:3 I talked about the continuity of TeX
development, and the way our community deals with the change of package
maintainers. As if to stress the relevance of the topic, Christian
Hupfer recently announced he is dropping the maintenance of his
xassoccnt package and welcomes new maintainers to take over this useful code.

I already mentioned that until the end of the year Pearson is offering TUG
members an exclusive 40% discount for the Jubilee printings of Computers
and Typesetting by Donald E. Knuth (see TUG members area,
https://tug.org/members/ for the discount code). Recently the PDFs were
updated; if you already bought the electronic edition, you may download
the updated version at no charge after logging in to the publisher site.

Those living in the San Francisco Bay Area might know about the very
interesting museum of typography, The Letterform Archive.  Recently
the museum made their first exhibition, ``Bauhaus Typography at 100'',
available online:
https://letterformarchive.org/news/view/exhibition-no.1-bauhaus-typography-at-100

New CTAN packages in November:
- formal-grammar, typeset formal grammars;
- hep-acronym, an acronym extension for glossaries;
- hep-bibliography, extension of biblatex for high energy physics;
- hep-float, convenience package for float placement;
- hep-font, Latin modern extended by computer modern;
- hep-math, extended math macros;
- hep-math-font, extended Greek and sans-serif math;
- hep-text, list and text extensions;
- hep-title, extensions for the title page;
- luafindfont, search fonts in the LuaTeX font database;
- njuvisual, display logos related to Nanjing University;
- snaptodo, a todo that snaps to the closer side;
- zref-clever, clever LaTeX cross-references based on zref.

Happy TeXing to all,
Boris Veytsman (TUG President)

A simple answer to my problem. I'm running a Devuan distribution, and 
so all needed to do was to install the texlive-fonts-extra package.
I had missed that step in my directions for installing TeXLive.

I spoke too soon. The tex file configuration ran without displaying
error, but it turns out that there was in fact an error.

>

When I run updmap-sys, I get this

updmap [ERROR]: The following map file(s) couldn't be found:
updmap [ERROR]:         newfont.map (in /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg)
updmap [ERROR]: Did you run mktexlsr?

I had indeed run mktexlsr.

> And which tex system do you use?

pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.23 (TeX Live 2021)


I find that in /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-config/web2c there is
indeed a updmap.cfg file. But it only a single line:

  Map newfont.map 

I looked at my old upmap.cfg file and there was quite a bit to
it. So I ran # update-updmap amd then $ mktexlsr again. But this
had no effect on the updmap.cfg file.

This is a common issue when browsing for references, you end up on
the full text and want to cite it but don't want to guess
where the publisher put the citation information. URL mutation,
or even extraction from the html in the case of local html files,
may be a useful strategy to add. TooBib tells you how it
found that and can get more possibilities allowing for manual
curation when the effort is somewhat adversarial or speculative.


I just posted another manuscript,


https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356785163_Wetting_Tryptophan_With_Calcium_Pantothenate

but the suggested bibtex uses quotes instead of curly braces because
I can't get the curly brace code to work.
This command works fine to concatenate a total bibtex entry
( it updates two variables in a normal and single-line format ) 
but there is no way AFAICT to replace the quotes with curly 
braces, 

\newcommand{\mjmaddbib}[2]
{

{\hypersetup{pdfinfo={{\mjmbibmunge{#1}}={#2}}}}
\edef\mjmbibentry{\unexpanded\expandafter{\mjmbibentry,}

    #1 ="#2" }
\edef\mjmbiboneentry{\unexpanded\expandafter{\mjmbiboneentry,}
#1 ="#2"
}
} 

I hunted all over stackoverflow etc without anything that seems
to work here.... Any ideas? 

Thanks.

Running pdflatex on the tex file indicates successfully formated, but 
no PDF is produced. 

I look at the log and this time there is the error

  !pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file gbsnu75): Font gbsnu75 at 864 not found
   ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

I go to tlmgr to install gbsnu75 and it says it is already present.

If I compile different portions of my .tex file, differnt fonts can't
be found:

  !pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file ptmro8r): Font ptmro8r at 720 not found
   ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

Running updmap and texhash commands does not help

I've tried to narrow the problem down. Pdflatex runs this file successfully:

\begin{document}
  test
\end{document}

But this fails to produce a PDF with this:

  test
\end{document} 

with error:

  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!

CTAN says the mathptmx package is part of psnfss, but is reckoned to be 
obsolete. Users are recommended to switch to using newtx in its place. 

tlmr tells me newtx aleady present. If I run pdflatex on this

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{newtx}
\begin{document}

I get the same error.

Hi Haines,

      !pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file ptmr8r): Font ptmr8r at 600 not found

These problems are all about the pdftex.map (pdftex) or psfonts.map
(dvips) file. The underlying problem is what you noticed -- updmap.cfg
containing only that one line. If you run kpsewhich --all updmap.cfg, it
should show the different files being used, and the main one, presumably
/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg
should have hundreds of lines in it (one for each package providing
fonts that need map files).

When you "copied over the fonts", you bypassed package installation,
which is what would update updmap.cfg. So it might work to "copy over"
the above updmap.cfg to the new machine (and then run updmap-sys
again).

Or perhaps if you run updmap-sys --syncwithtrees it will find the
missing map files and offer to update the updmap.cfg; I can't say I've
ever really tried it, but the option is there.

newtx vs. mathptmx is not the problem. You will get the same error with
virtually any non-CM font. --hope this helps, karl.

I did copy over the old updmap.cfg and ran it. But using it produced 
error: 

  updmap [ERROR]: The following map file(s) couldn't be found:
  updmap [ERROR]:  pxtx.map (in /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg)

Running updmap-sys again did not help.  

I looked at the new updmap.cfg and found in it the line

  Map pxtx in updmap.cfg

So followed your advice and did 

   updmap-sys --syncwithtrees

That fixed the problem: pdflatex produces a PDF without error.  I thank
you. 

Apparently I made a mistake when setting up the new system by simply copying
font files over.  Are you implying I should not have done with fonts from the
old /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts? If not what would have been the 
proper procedure?

Thanks, Riccardo.

So did you simply give up on Skype? Did you try to install an older version
of SkypeforLinux-64.deb?

Thanks, Reiccardo.

I dug up an older skypeforlinux-64.deb and was able to start the test
call without crashing. But the test call does not hear my audio.

The audio test works. I installed pavucontrol. Do I also need pulseaudio 
as well?

       updmap-sys --syncwithtrees
    That fixed the problem: pdflatex produces a PDF without error.

Yay!

    old /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts? 

I didn't realize we were talking about texmf-local.
Copying over the entire texmf-local tree to a new install should be ok.

      updmap [ERROR]: The following map file(s) couldn't be found:
      updmap [ERROR]:  pxtx.map (in /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg)

pxtx.map was removed in an update (to pxtxalfa) this year; unrelated to
texmf-local. So perhaps you copied over the updmap.cfg files not just
from texmf-local, but also the other trees?  And then it would not match
the current version of the packages, if that's what you then installed.

    If not what would have been the proper procedure?

What I would do is either 1) copy over the entire installed TL,
or 2) install a fresh TL on the target system and then just copy over
texmf-local. Either of these should end up with something
self-consistent. I admit I'm not clear on what you did.

BTW, I'm also confused by your mention of various Devuan packages and
the use of /usr/local/texlive/2021.  The /usr/local/texlive/YYYY dirs
are where the original/upstream TL is installed by default; the distros
don't use it (as far as I know; it would be a terrible mistake on their
part if they did).

Analogously, the original TL does not use anything from system
directories, so installing distro packages, or not, should make no
difference.  (The goal of keeping them separate is to make it possible
for people to run a distro's TeX and the original TL at the same time,
merely by changing PATH.)

Anyway, glad you've got things going now. Yay for --syncwithtrees :). -k

Hello,
I am using the   dvips.def  color approach within TeX.    And
all is good.    But now I would like to include another color ---
I am missing a point here.    I have attached three files below
dvips.def:   the original file with two additional lines at the end
                  to  define the  color  LightPink  rgb  1.0, 0.68,0.73.

jjkk:             a short file
test.tex         the test file  .

What needs to be done to get  the color LightPink to work?

Many thanks in advance for your assistance.

dvips.def (which you probably shouldn't edit) is designed as the back end
for dvips for the latex color package which you can use in plain via the
graphics-pln bundle and its miniltx wrapper.
Your jjkk file is a very minimal definition of \color  which disables most
of the functionality, just directly accessing the build in list of names
known by the dvips dvi driver. Also \definecolortakes teh color name first,
not the color model.

This makes black and pink text using the dvips.def in the tex distributions
if processed with tex, dvips, ps2pdf


\input color
\definecolor{LightPink}{rgb}{1.0,0.68,0.73}

 black {\color{LightPink} This is pink}

\bye

Yes, exactly; pink but not light pink, which would be
more like 1.0, 0.84, 0.90.

?? I just used the definition you posted in your original message, but with
the arguments LightPink and rgb swapped to be in the right order.

I am trying to slightly enhance the TeX command "input color"
so it will include the  547 color definitions  due to Loreti.

What I would like is to leave this additional info (say within the
../tex-local/.. folder) so various TeX-live updates will continue
to operate correctly.

Currently I am using a less than optimal approach in which I
have modified a TeX-live file not in the ../tex-local/... .
 .../texlive/YYYY/tex-dist/tex/latex/graphics-def/dvips.def
by adding the following line at the end of the file
\input /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/plain/local/colordef.tex

currently when I run tex on a file with \input color  is obtain

This is TeX, Version 3.141592653 (TeX Live 2021) (preloaded format=tex)

(./test.tex

(/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/plain/graphics-pln/color.tex

(/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/plain/local/miniltx.tex)

(/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/graphics/color.sty

(/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/graphics-cfg/color.cfg)

(/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/graphics-def/dvips.def

(/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/plain/local/colordef.tex)))) [1] )

Output written on test.dvi (1 page, 304 bytes).

Transcript written on test.log.


I have attached this file below with the test.pdf as well.


Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

It's not really clear what your question is but I wouldn't modify dvips.def
(well, I would if I was me, I wouldn't if I was you:-)  just put a
`mycolors.tex` in the local directory alongside your colordef.tex that has

\input color
\input colordef


then your document can use

\input mycolors

instead of

\input color

Would you consider something like the following as an acceptable solution?

(1) Create a file which contains
        \input color
        \input /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/plain/local/colordef.tex
(2) Put that file in (say)
        /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/plain/local/my-color.tex
(3) In your source files, use
        \input my-color
    instead of
        \input color
?

I realize that it would require modifying your source files.


Alternatively, and I haven't tried this, if
        /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/plain/local/
precedes
        /usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/plain/graphics-pln/
in however you have your system configured, then you might be able to
put the above file (in (1)) in 
        /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/plain/local/color.tex

Cheers.

Subject: Color "item #"
Message-ID: <20211221155457.00004041@seibercom.net>

I am using the "enumitem" package to create lists used in reports I
generate. My supervisor wants me to have the item number or letter in a
different color from the item's text. For instance, in the following
example, the "(1)" would be in blue and the text in black.

	(1) This is item one.

I cannot find a way to accomplish this easily. Is there something I am
missing here or is it just not feasible? My supervisor is insisting on
it because he can do exactly that in MS Word.

Dave, that works if I want to change every item in the list to the same
color. I was looking for a method to change different items to
different colors in the same list. I have seen examples of how to do it
with itemized lists, but not numbered or lettered lists.

Thanks David, I had not considered that approach before. While I have
your attention, I do have one other quick question. I have used the
"soul" package to create text background colors. I can use the
"\hl{text}" command inside an enumerate listing; however, it can only
be used AFTER an "\item" command, ie

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \hl{This is text with a yellow background}
\end{enumerate}

If I try to place the "\hl" command before the "\item" an error
message is issued.

Again, I can do it in MS Word, so I figure that there has to be a
relatively easy way to do it in LaTeX also. I am just not finding it.

you could use \ul in the label format (or rather a local command that you
define to be \url or not) in a similar way to color, or simpler if you want
a rectangular box around the whole list use \colorbox around a \parbox with
the list. If you are using luatex you could look at using lua-ul instead of
soul, as it attacks things at a different level and avoids many of the
complications soul has to deal with.

Your expectations are rather different to mine:-) The underlying models of
TeX and Word are so fundamentally different I would find it natural that
things that are easy in Word are harder in TeX and vice versa.

Does anyone have an idea how to (or even if you can) plot Airy functions in LaTex?
Thanks in advance.

Run with lualatex or latex->dvips->ps2pdf

The initial values f?r y(-10) and y'(-10) are guessed and not really 
calculated

\documentclass[border=5mm]{standalone}
\usepackage{pstricks-add}
\begin{document}

\def\Funct{ exch x mul}%?? y'' = y*x???????? on stack y y''
\psset{xunit=1.5, yunit=5, method=varrkiv, showpoints=true}
\begin{pspicture}(-11,-1)(1,1.1)
\psaxes[Dy=0.2]{->}(0,0)(-11,-1)(1,1)
\psplotDiffEqn[varsteptol=.00001,plotpoints=500, 
linecolor=red]{-10}{0}{0.05 1}{ \Funct }
\psplotDiffEqn[varsteptol=.00001,plotpoints=500, 
linecolor=blue]{-10}{0}{-0.35 0}{ \Funct }
\end{pspicture}

\end{document}

\psplotDiffEqn [Options] {x0}{x1}{y0}{ f(x,y,y?,...) }

This should be pretty easy for TooBib and Zotero but both
fail now,

https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/7/2130/htm

I'm getting 403's on wget spoofing and headless chrome
and apparently they disabled Zotero too. I have no 
idea why people don't want their work cited.
Probably would be faster to take notes with pen 
and paper :) This was just going to be part of a 5 minute
post on social media and already turned into a new research
project :) 

This happens from time to time and usually I contact
the publisher but its is probably more robust
to have a better way to download the thing.
Failing that, I'll have to find a way to translate
the URL I guess...


Thanks.

Faster than pen and paper the google scholar link under related info links
give bibtex and other formats for citing the article.  Search in Jabref
also found the required bibliographic material;

You need to see the usage of Zotero and TooBib :) 
One goal is to create a single action for getting a bibtex
entry from any given page to avoid disrupting the train
of thought while compiling citations. 
In my case, I want to extend bibtex to "BomTex" or Bill Of Materials
to hopefully allow publications that create customers to get
some credit. In any case, from time to time you find publishers
that make it hard to cite their works. Even when working 
cooperatively, they have different styles and button or whatever.
Ideally an authors does not need to hunt around for this junk.

They have a doi link on their page which I could also use that
worked with TooBib and probably Zotero too. 

And I'm still left wondering how they detect. I pointed the
interactive browser at 127.0.0.1 non-secure and wget should be
duplicating the request pretty good. Puppeteer may be an option
but my older unix won't support the latest one. Headless chrome
identifies itself. I guess I could build a custom chrome
which sounds like a lot of work but should not require
extensive changes to the headless thing.

Thanks.

I must admit I have never understood this.  Given the effort required to
write a paper and presumably to read the paper you are citing, clicking on
a link labelled "Citation export" to get a bibtex entry seems to me to be a
completely insignificant effort. I can see if you want to extract a bibtex
database of the entire journal archive, an automated API might be useful,
but for actual document authors, needing individual entries, what is the
workflow that you are imagining here?

I believe there is a need for something that will download the record and
check if an existing record is correct... so a journal -- upon receiving a
submission -- would follow a DOI or an URL, and verify and even augment the
existing record.

Yes, using a computer to automate data processing has a lot of
merit. Curious if anyone ever thought of that :) I was thinking
about a retraction check prior to submission. In any case,
for note taking or citing a paper you have already
read, in this case I was making a social media post,
hunting around is just a distraction. This is even a bigger
issue when viewing a pdf file or other page without the
citation info immediately obvious. 

I often can collect several abstracts following a chain
of ideas. Then, go back and read the papers that are most
important. Sometimes just the bibtex file may be a useful
literature search result. 
I end up with introductory sentences that make broad
statements about existing literature and finding a few
papers to cite based on the abstract may be useful but
you may not read much of them and often the abstract
makes enough of the point to cite just that.  
Sometimes I'm trying to find a
paper that just says something that is common knowledge to
part of an audience but not another part and don't want
to read the whole thing- sometimes citations to
wikipedia work for that. 


In any case, automation of tedious repetitive tasks
is good...

Subject: Ask for a feature to the TexWork developers
Message-ID: <CA+JaT-DEdxW1n=VA72==9RqGm3AnmAbFRwK0GjcgfpGahRLQGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all the TexWork developers and users

I'm a happy user of TexWorks and reading the TexWorks page I get this email
in a mailing list to post to all users and developers.

Anyway I would like to see in the next versions of TexWorks the ability to
hide the document margin space in the typeset view. Sometimes I need to
check out lines related to a previous part located in the page immediately
before but the margin blank space occupies too much space and difficulties
the content check so I need to scroll up and down many times. That problem
could be easily solved if TexWorks added a way of hiding the margin space
from the typesetting view.
