Subject: Feb21 TUG news: elections, lectures, papers, TeX tuneup, CTAN
Message-ID: <202102030214.1132EX5C023736@freefriends.org>

Dear TeXers!

The most notable upcoming event for TUG members is this year's election.
Nominations for board member or president are due:
    07:00 a.m. PST, 1 March 2021
The process is described at https://tug.org/election. We have an
unusually high number of expiring terms this year. Please consider
serving the community if you have the time and inclination to do so.

Our friends at the Cary Graphics Art Collection at the Rochester
Institute of Technology (https://rit.edu/carycollection/) posted a
schedule of their own new events. There are some notable entries
including a Cary Pressroom Tour (February 12) with associate curator
Amelia Hugill-Fontanel, who delivered a memorable talk on type
speciments at TUG 2020 (available online, https://tug.org/tug2020), a
lecture about Tibetan typeforms (February 26) by Jo De Baerdemaeker, a
tour of the collection with curator Steven Galbraith (April 16), and
other events, see https://mailchi.mp/rit/cary-collection-news-jan2021.
All are online.

Cary events require (free) registration; while their form is geared
towards RIT students and faculty, the general public is allowed and
encouraged to join in (set your affiliation as 'Other' on the form).

Amelia is also the latest subject in the Interview Corner. Her
interview, conducted by David Walden, includes many illustrations of
some amazing book- and type-related items from the Cary Collection:
  https://tug.org/interviews/hugill-fontanel.pdf

On another front, the LearnLaTeX website has gone public:
  https://learnlatex.org/en/
It contains 16 short lessons, interactive examples, and is available in
many languages. Give it a whirl, send feedback, pass it on ...

Some of us may have attended the lecture by DEK in 2014 about
unfortunate trends in the history of computer science. The transcript of
the lecture is now published in the Communications of the ACM:
https://doi.org/10.1145/3442377.

In other DEK news, he has finished the 2021 tuneup of TeX, Metafont and
friends! The updates are being tested and will soon be on CTAN and in
distributions. The report will appear in the next issue of TUGboat.

New packages on CTAN in January:

- aalok, LaTeX class file for the Marathi journal `Aalok';
- alfaslabone, the Alfa Slab One typeface;
- cascadia-code, the Cascadia Code font;
- chifoot, Chicago-style footnote formatting;
- easybook, typeset Chinese books or notes;
- gudea, the Gudea typeface;
- hindmadurai, the HindMadurai typeface;
- luakeys, a Lua module for parsing key-value options;
- magra, the Magra typeface;
- matapli, class for the French journal `MATAPLI';
- mlmodern, a blacker Type 1 version of Computer Modern, with
  multilingual support;
- nunito, the Nunito typeface;
- orientation, set page orientation with dvips/Ghostscript (ps2pdf);
- play-font, the Play typeface;
- profcollege, a LaTeX package for French maths teachers in college;
- pxpic, draw pixel pictures;
- sankey, draw Sankey diagrams with TikZ;
- tikz-bbox, precise determination of bounding boxes in TikZ.

Finally, let me mention that the latest update to the newcomputermodern
font project provides complete coverage of all Unicode math characters:
https://ctan.org/ctan-ann/id/mailman.3089.1611042712.2532.ctan-ann at ctan.org

Happy TeXing!

Subject: Custom horizontal lines
Message-ID: <012501d6fb2c$d9828230$8c878690$@seibercom.net>

I am looking for a package that provides custom horizontal lines. In MS Word
and other word processors, there is an option to insert various horizontal
lines, often used as page or section dividers. I cannot find a latex package
that provides that sort of function. Does one exist, or is there a
relatively simple way to construct a custom horizontal line in latex?

No, that is not correct. If I use the following, it will create a custom
horizontal line combination.

 

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{.5pt}

\rule[.6\baselineskip]{\textwidth}{3pt}

 

There are other combinations that I can tie together to get the effect I
want. I was wondering if there is a package that would make this easier.

Subject: "bbding" package with "lualatex"
Message-ID: <001301d6fbe9$e4a13450$ade39cf0$@seibercom.net>

I am using lualatex.exe with Texstudio on a Win 10 PRO machine. I am attempting to use the "bbding" package to create different objects. This is a simple code example I have tried.

`\documentclass[10pt,letterpaper,final]{article}
\usepackage{bbding}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{ucs}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}

\usepackage[width=8.50in, height=11.00in, left=0.50in, right=0.50in, top=1.00in, bottom=1.00in]{geometry}
\begin{document}

\Square

\Phone
\end{document}`

This is the log output specific to the \Square and \Phone entries:

`LaTeX Font Info: Trying to load font information for U+ding on input line 12

Nothing is printed on the screen. I have reinstalled the package; however, it doesn't help. Is this a problem with lualatex.exe or something else?

Thanks!

Wrong order of packages and wrong package fontenc for lualatex:

\documentclass[10pt,letterpaper,final]{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{bbding}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage[width=8.50in, height=11.00in, left=0.50in, right=0.50in, 
top=1.00in,
bottom=1.00in]{geometry}
\begin{document}

\Square

\Phone
\end{document}


works. However, using package fontawesome makes more sense than bbing

Actually, that did not work either However, substituting "fontawesome" did.
I also noticed, when I used the package in the actual document I was working
on, that "microtype" and "fontawesome" do not play well together. I removed
"microtype" and all is well.

Thanks for your assistance.

Well using ucs and fontenc is wrong with lualatex. But this
shouldn't happen with your example. Is your tex-system up-to-date?

What do the first 10 line of your log-file say?

I couldn't reproduce the problem either.  I tried before and after
updating TeX Live.  Everything works like a charm.

However, Jerry's mail contains

Ulrike, could you try Herbert's file with MiKTeX?  Just to confirm
that MiKTeX provides up-to-date TeX Live packages.

This is the LaTeX file:

\Square

\Phone

It sounds like my firewall is blocking you. What is your IP?

David sent me the file per mail. I see nothing obvious why the
lookups happen. The only idea I have is that the fonts are not found
and that you have some file around that confuses luaotfload

- install the miktex package niceframe-type1
- ensure that the fontmap files are up-to-date by running the
relevant task in the miktex console (in user mode).

- check if you have any file called "bbding10..." around that can
confuse luaotfload.

I would like to put figures in the upper right corner of paragraphs.


I am following the Seroul & Levy cornerBox routine

which is fine for upper left corner figures.

What am I missing here?


Here are the files I have included here.


box and box.1     metaPost figure

cornerBox.h       tex to draw figures.

                  cornerBoxR   upper right corner,  NEEDS HELP!

                  cornerBoxL   upper left corner (this works)

Seite.tex         the TeX test file.    German is what I was working with!

It's not only Jonathan who can't reach the site.

Maybe the firewall is the culprit but please check the configuration
of your web server as well.

Attached is a working version, Walt.?? Code re-formatted and factored 
out to make it legible/comprehensible, and the three key changes flagged 
as "added, important" or "deleted, important".

I ran the IP's supplied to me by those unable to access my site. I
discovered that they are being blacklisted. SEE:
https://www.ipvoid.com/ip-blacklist-check/ My server uses SpamHaus, and
apparently, it is blocking those IPs. There is not much I can do about it
except for disabling it, and I am not about to do that.

I apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused anyone.

I am presently using MiKTex with TexStudio on a Windows 10 PRO machine. I am
experimenting with using fonts from Windows in documents I create with
LuaLaTeX. I had heard it was relatively easy to use a Window's font with
LuaLaTeX; however, I have not discovered the secret to doing it.

 

Could someone point me to a good example or tutorial on accomplishing this?
Presently, I am trying to use the Georgia font with LuaLaTeX.

Unfortunately, there isn't a 'georgia' font package. At least not one I can
locate in MiKTeX.

Not a MiKTeX package. Arial and Georgia are "core web fonts"
freely available from Microsoft:

Hi Jerry,

Herbert and David already answered your question.  In addition I
strongly recommend to consult the fontspec documentation too.  The
easiest way is to type

  texdoc fontspec

on the command line.  The fontspec package offers a lot of nice
features you certainly need in the near future.

Regards,
  Reinhard

That does tell me how to use the font already available on my system with
LuaLaTeX. I was told it was supposed to be easy to use available Windows
fonts with LuaLaTeX, but I have not discovered the secret.

Did you mean to write "does *not* tell me..."? 

Look in your Windows font folder (C:\Windows\Fonts). If the
Georgia fonts are there, lualatex and fontspec will find them.

Bob T.

P.S. Apparently Microsoft no longer distribute the core
web fonts. If your system doesn't have them, you can get
them from the sourceforge site mentioned in the Wikipedia
article.

Microsoft doesn't offer the fonts for free download anymore but they
are still shipped with Windows.

The screenshot provided by David Carlisle proves that the Georgia
fonts are still present.

The fonts provided by Microsoft nowadays are extended for better
Unicode support and thus it's definitely a very bad idea to install
the old stuff from Sourceforge.

The secret is

  texdoc fontspec

David's example proves that it's dead easy.

Jerry, it would be extremely helpful to know whether the simple
example provided by David works for you or not.

  Reinhard

Unfortunately, no. It seems LuaLaTeX cannot find the font. I checked, and it
is present and works with MS Word.

This is a small tex file:

\documentclass[10pt,letterpaper,oneside,final]{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage[width=8.50in, height=11.00in, left=0.50in, right=0.50in,
top=1.00in, bottom=1.00in]{geometry}
\begin{document}
	
\fontfamily{Georgia}\selectfont

This is a test of Georgia font. \\
	
\end{document}

This is the actual log file. You will notice that it states that it cannot
find the file. I have used both "Georgia" and "georgia".

Message-ID: <VI1PR07MB59181753095A5A432F04E98E8C889@VI1PR07MB5918.eurprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hi everybody,

I'm typesetting a large document with amsbook and biblatex's numeric style.

Book entries in References are formatted as follows:

W. Rudin, {\it Principles of mathematical analysis}, Third Ed., International Series in Pure and Applied Mathematics, New York: McGraw--Hill Book Co., 1976.

I would like to have instead

W. Rudin, {\it Principles of mathematical analysis}, Third Ed., International Series in Pure and Applied Mathematics, McGraw--Hill Book Co., New York, 1976.

i.e. I would like to have the fields ADDRESS and PUBLISHER switched and separated by a comma in place of a colon.

I went through the BibLaTeX manual to no avail. Do you have any suggestions on how this can be accomplished?

Thanks in advance,

       Pietro

Hallo Pietro ? I cannot help with your question (I do not use BibLaTeX) 
but I have a query, if I may ? Why the en-dash in McGraw--Hill ?? This 
should be a conventional typographic hyphen (U+002D), should it not ?

Hi Philip,

thanks for pointing this out, it was my mistake. The corresponding field in the bib file is

PUBLISHER = {McGraw-Hill Book Co.},

so there is actually a hyphen and not an ed-dash.

Best regards,

     Pietro

Sorry if this is off-topic; but I think it is quite common
to use an en-dash for combining the names of different
people. (McGraw and Hill were two different people.)


kind regards

Possibly a cultural difference.? But personally I would be guided by 
M-H's house style, and the HTML <title> attribute of the M-H Education 
page <https://www.mheducation.com/highered/home-guest.html> is

> McGraw-Hill Higher Education

which the Babelstone Unicode analyser 
<https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Unicode/whatisit.html> reports as

Thank you very much, Ulrike. Upon looking at the post on StackExchange
I realized why I could not find how to edit the formatting of the entries:
I was looking into numeric.bbx instead of standard.bbx.

Thanks again!

    Sorry if this is off-topic; but I think it is quite common
    to use an en-dash for combining the names of different
    people. (McGraw and Hill were two different people.)

You are surely correct about the common usage of the en-dash. I am somewhat sensitive to the issue myself, having a hyphenated surname.

However, as far as I have been able to find out, the company itself used a hyphen in its own name. Hence I think correct usage is indeed with a hyphen.

This is perhaps not unlike the origin of hyphenated names like my own: My great-grandfather Oscar Olsen married Othilie Hanche, and my grandfather took the hyphenated name combining the two. In the same vein, then, you could consider the publishing company the joint offspring of McGraw and Hill.

(After the company split up, they seem also to have split the name, so it is now McGraw Hill.)

Just one more note before we can put the hyphen-vs-en-dash question to rest:



The wikipedia page [1[ uses the en-dash consistently. However, on the talk page [2] we find the following comment:



McGraw-Hill (yes, hyphen) publishing companies should ideally have a separate article

Right now the history of the McGraw-Hill companies prior to the recent reorgs/divestments is being passed around in a disorganized manner between their successor corporations. They should really have a separate article. [?]



[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Global

[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:S&P_Global



Whether their use of the en-dash for the successor companies is correct or not, I do not know. But at least, here is some support for the hyphen hypothesis.



I remember wasting too much time some years ago trying to get to the bottom of the mystery, with little success.

Message-ID: <00ba01d706e0$82396740$86ac35c0$@seibercom.net>

I have no idea if this is possible, so I thought I would ask.

I work for a municipality. I need to create several documents that need to be numbered in consecutive order, i.e., SWI-100, SWI-101, SWI-102, etcetera. Is there any latex package that can keep track of the last used number and increment it in each new document? Since all of the papers are not written simultaneously, it would need to "remember" the last used number and increment it at a future date. I can do this with a regular MS Access database or MySQL, but I cannot figure out how to do it with LaTeX.

Thanks!

I may be missing something obvious, but why can you not (a) open a 
tracker file for reading, and note if it is empty; then, (b) if it is 
not empty, read an integer from it, increment the integer, close the 
file for reading, open it for writing, and write the augmented integer 
back.? If it was empty, treat it as if it contained zero.

I was hoping someone would have a cool answer but I'll offer my own :)
I am trying to track my self-published works generally with
bib entries as "techreport." Ideally I will have polished publications
at some point but for now it lets me track and respond quickly
with something someone can cite if desired. For example,
in response to a conversation the prior day, I posted
this abstract that could eventually be the basis for a
real tech report,  

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marchywka_clotting-paradox-abstract-activity-6760889521887350784-B9ZH

If you download it and look at the extended info you can find the
techreport bibtex entry but on the headers there should be
a document serial number. This is created by a script I have called
"newproj" that sets up a new directory, copies a skeleton file 
and gives it a serial number. The part of the script
is this. Note that is starts off with a flakey error- you should
get ONE date and parse that. This can generate wierd results 
around midnight, when vampires come out :) The serial number
thing though works AFAICT. The rest of this is for my
automated embedded bibtex to make it easily citeable without
a DOI or "real" publisher.  There are a lot of other kluges
as in my old bibtex downloader script but the c++ implementation
can be a lot better :)  

get_serials()
{
# 4 digit year
# FIXME TODO this has serial boundary problems, 
# good place for double check locking? lol
# should get one date and go with that. 
date=`date`
year=`date --date="$date" +%Y`
moname=`date --date="$date"  +%B`
mono=`date --date="$date"  +%m`
day=`date  --date="$date" +%d`
date=`date --date="$date" +"%B %d %Y"`

x=`cat "$INDEX_FILE" | grep TECHREPORT | tail -n 1 | sed -e 's/.*MJM-//'| sed -e 's/[-,]/ /g' `

last_year=`echo $x | awk '{print $1}'`
last_serial=`echo $x | awk '{print $2}'`
if [ "$last_year" != "$year" ]
then
serial="001"
else
serial=$[ $last_serial + 1 ]
while [  ${#serial} -lt 3 ] ; do  serial="0$serial" ; done
fi
status found serial info  $year $serial
last_trno="MJM-$last_year-$last_serial"
}


When the project is finally ready to make, the index file is
updates with a more or less complete bibentry for the project,
( not just a serial number), 

status sending to "$INDEX_FILE"
fbackupfn "$INDEX_FILE"
print_bib_entry >> "$INDEX_FILE"




The skeleton file also opens files for things like page count and
a release list that is included in the draft pdf files. 
fwiw.

Let's suppose you need to create files SWI-100.pdf, SWI-101.pdf, etc. This
is a sensible naming convention if you're storing the files, say for
delivery on a website.

So why not create files SWI-100.tex, SWI-102.tex etc such that SWI-100.pdf
is the output of running SWI-100.tex etc.

By the way, you might find \jobname useful, as in

$ tex story
This is TeX, Version 3.14159265 (TeX Live 2019) (preloaded format=tex)
(/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/tex/plain/knuth-lib/story.tex [1])
*\immediate\write16{\jobname}
story

Perhaps I am misunderstanding you, but that sounds like a like more
work than I want to invest. I was looking for an automated system.

I have investigated using SQL with LaTeX to get what I want. It won't
be easy; however, it seems like once I get it up and running, it will
take care of itself. (famous last words)

In that case, I am very very confused !? The system /is/ "automated"; 
all you have to do is to add a tiny bit of code to your TeX source.? The 
following is written without testing, but it should be pretty close to a 
solution:

\newread \trackerin

\newwrite \trackerout


\newcount \seqno


\openin \trackerin = tracker.txt

\ifeof \trackerin

 ??? \seqno = 0

\else

 ??? \read \trackerin to \seqtmp

 ??? \seqno = \seqtmp

\fi

\closein \trackerin


\advance \seqno by 1

\message {New sequence number = \number \seqno}


\immediate \openout \trackerout = tracker.txt

\immediate \write \trackerout {\number \seqno}

\immediate \closeout \trackerout


\end

Is this a versioning system or a document tracking system? You want
to get a new version for each time you run latex? 

For a lot of applications, the DB may be more hassle than it is worth.
In my c++ imeplemtation, I can do everything in text files probably
although having an in-memory data structure with a variety
of indicies. In the present case, you probably want more than a number
but detailed bibliographic info on each document. You may as well store
that as bibtex or something easily converted. A bib file works for that.
If you have a bibtex parser, someone else here IIRC at utah.edu has
a conforming one, you can load all the existing entries and derive
a new document name and number, edit the bib file programmatically,
and write it back out  etc.  It could take SQL that long to parse
a query lol plus you can edit the "DB" with vi and back it up
with gzip lol.

This was interesting because I'm working on moving my bibtex
discover script to c++ ( using it now for research )
and had forgotten about this part of the bibtex
editing...

I set up something similar to this once, but it's the external program that
comes up with the number and names the file (SQL in your case, a perl
script in mine) and all the LaTeX does is incorporate the number in the
document itself and print it in the header or footer or whatever. I used to
try to glean the number from the file name, but it was easier just to make
the script write the number into the file itself and have a macro grab it
during the formatting process.

I'd follow the same pattern as the one Tom described. Have the external
system create ALL the inputs that the typesetting program needs to produce
the PDF. Let TeX do ALL the typesetting, and the external system ALL the
preparation of inputs for typesetting.

I'm surprised nothing exists like this- a GUI with a bunch of templates
or "wizards" to create document skeletons. I have a rather specialized
setup for all scripted command line stuff and am quite happy with it.
I'm not sure you would want  just have a counter file to serialize
documents although I have
a bunch of project or document specific files like page count
and list of releases that get included in the main tex file.

Even for a scalable distributed document management system,
I'd imagine stuff like that exists that is not tied to a specific
thing like latex, or maybe some kind of "asset" tracking system,
if you are going to assign numbers with unique local prefixes,
say each author has his own, you don't really need a DB to
go get the next document ID. Having a local author specific
list of prior documents that you can publish to a main
DB later may make a lot more sense. 

You probably have a lot of document types- letters, forms, 
manuscripts or tech report, memo, whatever- with
different tracking, distribution, and approval chains.
It could get quite involved but locally you maybe
can isolate a lot of that.

I still do not understand why anything more than "TeX out of the box" is 
required.? I have shewn in a previous message how a simple text file, in 
conjunction with TeX, can be used to generate a monotonic increasing 
sequence of integers, and if each document requires its own sequence 
then the following trivial modification is all that is required ?

    \newread \trackerin

    \newwrite \trackerout


    \newcount \seqno


    \openin \trackerin = \jobname.seqno

    \ifeof \trackerin

     ??? \seqno = 0

    \else

     ??? \read \trackerin to \seqtmp

     ??? \seqno = \seqtmp

    \fi

    \closein \trackerin


    \advance \seqno by 1

    \message {New sequence number = \number \seqno}


    \immediate \openout \trackerout = \jobname.seqno

    \immediate \write \trackerout {\number \seqno}

    \immediate \closeout \trackerout


    \end

This is a statement of fact, that I don't wish to dispute. However, I think
the question is being discussed on the basis of good taste and being
sensible. And that much depends on the context, and the preferences, skills
and opinions of those who create and support the production system.

I fear that there are many problems in having TeX increment a counter that
has a significance across the whole system. For example, what if producing
the report requires several typesetting runs.

One could program TeX to maintain a database, much like AWK can be so
programmed. And what we have here is a database of sorts. The 'requirement'
to use something other than TeX arises from things outside TeX, namely the
system that holds the data that is to be typeset.

OK, we can know nothing of the preferences and opinions of those 
who?create and support the production system, but we do know one fact 
about their skills, or at least about the skills of the person who asked 
the question in the first place.? We know, because he sent his message 
to the TeXhax list, that his skill-set includes TeX. Given that, and no 
other information, why not a solution predicated solely on the use of 
TeX, especially as the solution proposed makes no use of any advanced 
TeX features whatsoever ?

A valid point, and not one that my proposed solution would directly address.

Again, we know only two things about the system.? It supports a file 
system, and it supports TeX? Therefore let us use the file system and 
TeX rather than anything more complex.

It is helpful to learn the capabilities of Tex and if you need or want
to do that in Tex great but AFAICT the OP was more interested
in a larger system. 
Even if you just write for home use, there must be some way to track
what you do. Again, though, most email systems are nice for
that and if you want to keep all your publications and correspondences
indexed adding capability there may be good. If the pdf has human and
machine readable citation info, some include DOI in the extended
info but most people or organizations don't get a DOI for letters they write ,
things get a lot easier. So, again, I like my approach even if the
bash script is rather awful. I'm starting to clean this up now
in a utility I call "toobib."

Thanks, I did not have a lot of interest in that part but thought OP
may.I guess generally you may merge paragraphs or sections and then maybe argue/ back and forth on words or something but I've been writing alone for now.

Once we have that information, we are better able to give advice and useful
information. See also Mike's response to your earlier post.

Hi

Regarding https://jfine2358.github.io/post/2021/01/21/multi-author-docs/

Consider a cloud service that typesets reports. In some (I think many)
situations it's better that the cloud service be stateless.

In that case the cloud service must be give the report number to use (in
some form), but is incapable of incrementing the report number. (In
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing there is a file system,
but it exists only during the typesetting of the report. At the end of
typesetting, it is recycled.)

An architecture that gives TeX the responsibility for incrementing the
report number is inconsistent with serverless computing. (The phrase
transient server computing might be more accurate here.)

My preference and opinion is that serverless typesetting has a great deal
to offer to the TeX community.

Why not simply proceed on the basis of what we know, rather than waste 
the rest of eternity trying to establish exactly how many angels can sit 
on the head of a pin ?

Indeed.? I use nothing else.? I run TeX on my local machine and am 
completely independent of any servers, cloud-based services or whatever, 
apart from the occasional need to update my TeX installation.? Why 
anyone would choose anything more complex is beyond me.

I wish I had an eternity to waste. As it is, I'm a mortal with more to do
than I have years available. To make better use of my time, I intend to
remain silent regarding Philip's suggestion. There's no need for the two of
us to agree on this matter.

I prefer:

No man is an island entire of itself; every man
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine
own were; any man's death diminishes me,
because I am involved in mankind.
And therefore never send to know for whom
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.

Addressed in the code below.? For a normal run, the user just says "TeX 
<whatever>, and the output will be a non-zero decimal such as 2.00001, 
2.00002, etc.? ? For the final run, the user says "TeX \count 0 = 0 
\input <whatever>", the code will then round the counter up to the next 
exact integer, so the output will be (e.g.,) "3.0".? The only assumption 
is that not more than 65535 iterations will be required before a final run.

There was a spurious " sp" in the code as posted at "\seqno = \seqtmp 
sp"; this should, of course, have read simply "\seqno = \seqtmp", as 
\seqtmp contains a dimension, not an integer.? A better version is 
currently under development.

which version is now released below.? Modulo as-yet-unencountered bugs, 
I regard this as the final version.? Sequence numbers will start at 0.1, 
0.2, ..., 0.65535, and each time that the program is told that the 
present run is the final run for the current sequence, the sequence 
number will be rounded up to the next integer (so in the case above, 
rounded up to 1.0, after which sequence numbers will be 1.1, 1.2, ..., 
1.65535).? The mechanism for informing the program that any given run is 
the final run for the current sequence is as before:

 ??? TeX \count 0 = 0 \input <whatever>

The program will use the e-TeX extension "\dimexpr" if present, but is 
fully functional in Knuthian TeX.

Hi

There's another TeX Hour tonight, 6:30 to 7:30 pm UK time. That's about 2
hours from now. The zoom link for the TeX Hour is at
https://jfine2358.github.io/contact/

This week's topic is Durable Documents and Software. TeX
version 3.141592653 was released last month, so we'll talk about that and
other things. See
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/581118/whats-new-in-tex-version-3-141592653

The topics are now on a monthly cycle. For next month the TeX Hours are:

Thu 4 Mar: Beginners
Thu 11 Mar: Accessibility
Thu 18 Mar: Conversion
Thu 25 Mar: Durable Documents and Software

There's no new blog post this week.  But you might want to read last week's.
https://jfine2358.github.io/post/2021/02/18/tex-hour-agenda/

I'm grateful to the UK TeX Users Group for funding 3 months of non-free
zoom license that allows me to record the TeX Hour. For clarity, the TeX
Hour is not an official UK TUG event, although they have provided financial
support.

If there are any topics you'd like to have covered do let me know.
Particularly welcome are questions that lead to a 5 to 10 minute video that
would be of wide interest.

best wishes

Jonathan

Subject: use "\newgeometry" automatically 
Message-ID: <010b01d70d3c$7ef9add0$7ced0970$@seibercom.net>

I am trying to find a way to automatically use "\newgeometry" on every new
page created in a document after the initial first page. I know I can invoke
it by typing "\newpage" and then entering the command, but I want to get it
to work without my having to enter it manually. Is that even possible? 

Thanks!

Does every new page has a different layout?

It is rather rare to need \newgeometry at all (changing page size mid
document is not that common) but applying it at an automatic page break
isn't really possible. A paragraph is broken into lines before page
breaking is considered so you can not (directly) change the width of the
text block at an automatic page break as the lines of text at the top of
the page will already have been set based on the width of the previous page.

Hi Jerry

In light of David's wise remark, perhaps it would be helpful if you told us
the problem you want to solve, the outcome you wish to achieve. It may be
that it can be achieved in a way other than automatic use of \newgeometry.

See: https://xyproblem.info/

Ok, specifically,I need to change the top margin and head height
settings. The first page is just a normal business template. The second
page is supposed to have a picture in the heading on the left side and
some text on the right. The picture is circular and one inch in
diameter. Using 'fancyhdr;, when I place it in the 'fancyheader[l]'
command, the picture is too big for the area. Worse, text is then
written through it.

I can correct the problem using the '\newgeometry' command. I just
cannot figure out hoe to do it without having to enter it manually.

I hope I have explained this satisfactorily.

 Hi Jerry

Does the second page start with a new paragraph? Or with the remainder of
the last paragraph on the first page?

Don?t you just need to do something like (I am a LaTeX user, so, if using TeX, modify accordingly):

In the preamble:

\usepackage{fancyhdr,graphicx}
\fancypage style{mystyle}{
\fancyhf{}
\fancyhead[L]{\includegraphix[width=1in]{<figurename>}}
\fancyhead[R}{desired text}
}
\setlength{\headheight}{1in}   % or maybe a tad more to include the 1in graphic.
\pagestyle{mystyle}

with maybe a \thispagestyle{plain} command on the first page in the body of the document?

I hope this helps.

Cheers, Chris.

Typically this is done by setting the page geometry so that it fits
on the second and follow up page. 

On the first page you then start with a \vspace*{...} to move the
first line where ever is suitable for the first page layout.

Ulrike, I finally used a combination of 'fancyhdr' and your suggestion.
I had tried the 'afterpage' package; however, it messed up the page
numbering with the 'lastpage' package. There is probably a way around
that, but I could not find a solution quickly, so I abandoned it.

Anyway, thanks!
