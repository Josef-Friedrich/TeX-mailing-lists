I think I'll add a link to the TUG donation page for each of my
packages.  Other package authors may wish to do so as well, in an
attempt to reach some of the supposed million new users who may never
have seen the TUG website.

To rephrase that more clearly: In each of my packages, I'll add a link
pointing to the TUG donation page...

Thanks!

Could I ask to also tell people to mention your package in the
Comments section of the donation form?  I would like to get the
statistics about the this idea.

I don't have adobe's Garamond to test, but I did try with URW fonts,
And got no spaces with either ugmr8r.tfm or the 8a.

I didn't try any other fonts.

On my page at

https://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/latex.html

I've added a new box pointing to https://tug.org with the message:

   The Tex User Group (TUG) organization is the official home of all
   things TeX and LaTeX.

Next to it is the image at https://tug.org/images/tuglogo.png.
(It's my own copy so as not to burden tug.org.)

Everybody can do that to increase awareness of TUG.

THEN at the TUG page there could be a BIG clear link to the donations
page.  At the moment, the donation link is lost in the introduction
text.  In addition to that buried link, a box like the one on my page
could be created that links to the donation page.  Then people will be
reminded every time they come to the tug home page.

    The Tex User Group (TUG) organization is the official home of all
    things TeX and LaTeX.

Thank you very very much. However, 1) please fix the name to be "TeX
Users Group" (capital X, plural Users), and 2) I'm troubled by the
claim, because TUG is not the official home for the software (such as
tex.web) that Knuth himself maintains. He has never, and will never,
delegate that to anyone else. Similarly, TUG is not the official home
for LaTeX either (that would be latex-project.org). Etc.

So I feel we need to come up with some other wording, but my brain is
failing me. Maybe TUG "... is a central place for all ..." ?

    THEN at the TUG page there could be a BIG clear link to the donations

The TUG home page has, and must have, many purposes. Garnering donations
is not its first and foremost job. For one thing, TUG is better off with
members than donors. I can't make anything "BIG" except at the expense
of everything else.

    donation link is lost in the introduction text.  

I don't expect people to read text.  "Make a donation" is also the
second link in the navbar to the left, after only "Contact us".

Also, I plan to add a donation link next to "join us" at the top, but it
won't be for a few days.

Also, I plan to make a simplified donation page itself for people to
link to.

Of course everything can be missed, everyone looks in different places,
everyone has different expectations and thinks different things are
"obvious", etc., etc. In general, there are reasons for every single
word and every single link on that page. I've gone over it and over it
trying to reduce it, for 15+ years now. There are no easy
answers ... --thanks again, karl.

Ok, I've switched to that:

    The TeX Users Group (TUG)
    organization is a central place
    for all things TeX and LaTeX.

until/if you find something better.

Perfect!!!  Having it just below the 'join us' would be sufficient.

BTW, the program tftopl(1) converts binary tfm files to human-readable
property lists.  If anybody assumes that a tfm file lacks any
fontdimens, tftopl always provides the definitive answer.

The general question for the donation form might be:
"What specific new TeX developments would you like this donation to
support?"

A poll might be created to measure the levels of interest in each of a
list of particular developments/packages/fonts/ideas.

One potential problem with asking for support for particular ideas is
that such funds might be taken from support for important things like
the distributions or CTAN.  Hopefully new donors would make up the
difference.

With the supposed rush of new users of LaTeX, someone may want to
revive, update, or replace the 20-years dormant morehelp package, which
attempts to replace common LaTeX error messages with a more descriptive
explanation.

The package is available on CTAN but doesn't seem to be included in
TeXLive.

It isn't in texlive as it doesn't have a compatible licence, however I
suspect that the requirement is better handled by editing software.
Many tex editors more or less completely hide (or worse, mangle) the
tex error message, so having more descriptive messages from tex
wouldn't help. The editor itself can offer more help, I know auctex
(emacs tex mode) has had descriptive text for each error message given
by the latex format since the beginning.

On the other hand, there doesn't appear to be a big surge in the use of
CTAN, per their activity graph.

Either way, it may be useful to optionally replace things like the
classic "perhaps a missing \item" error with something more useful.

Well, I may have mis-read the article, but it seems to me that it is 
speaking of an increase in users of /*ShareLaTeX*/ rather than of 
/*LaTeX*/ /per se./

sure but unlike traditional use (where we have no idea how many users
there are) these online systems can count their users
so if sharelatex has a million users that is almost certainly an
increase in total tex usage overall.

Sorry for nitpicking, but this is not correct.  The data show the
*number* of users, not the *increase*.  I suspect many ShareLaTeX
customers used LaTeX quietly for quite some time.

As a consultant I had customers you would never suspect using TeX:
physicians, lawyers, shipping companies...  Since then I always
thought the number of TeX users was much greater than the usual
estimates.

This means, by the way, that I disagree with the point about rush of
new users.  We have the same users, they just became more visible.

I was going to post a question, but I tried one last thing and it worked.  In case anyone else ran into this, I thought it would be worth posting it.  Using the enumerate package, I had a list introduced by 
\begin{enumerate}[$T_1$:]\setcounter{enumi}{1}
I wasn't sure it would work.  But it did, almost, until I got to item 16 (having jumped from \item 8) and it set it as $T_{1}6$, that is the six was not subscripted.  So I tried
\begin{enumerate}[$T_{1}$:]\setcounter{enumi}{1}
and that didn't work at all.  All the items got set with T_1.  I thought I would be reduced to doing it myself.  But on the principle of try anything, I tried, not expecting much
\begin{enumerate}[$T_\bgroup1\egroup$:]\setcounter{enumi}{1}
and guess what!

Some day, I might actually understand what goes on under the hood.

I'd say this is (just about) documented behaviour:-)
although one thing the enumerate package doc doesn't say is that for most uses
it's better to use enumitem these days.

1 is replaced by \theenumi but \theenumi expands to 16 so as you say
this is T_16

Presumably with a warning "The counter will not be printed."
as a documented feature enumerate skips over any of the special tokens
that are  inside a {} group
so you can hide a in  {sample} i  to make sample i, sample ii rather
than sample i sbmple i

enumerate sees the 1 in that case and tex-primitive subscripts can be
delimited by implicit braces.
Rather than rely on low level subscript weirdness, or for cases where
you need real {}
you could use a definition such as \def\Tsub[#1]{T_{#1}}  then
$\Tsub[1]$
probably works (not tested:-)

Message-ID: <201710132218.v9DMIVxl014325@freefriends.org>

Dear \TeX{}ers,

It is now October, the month of Canadian Thanksgiving, Halloween,
Oktoberfest and other celebrations.  Have great Fall festivals!

There were several notable events in the last weeks.  Brian Dunn
started an interesting discussion about the finances and the future of
TUG and the TeX community; see the threads on the TeXHaX list:
https://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2017-September/thread.html,
https://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2017-October/thread.html.  I invite
other \TeX{}ers to join: we definitely need new ideas about promotion
of TeX and TUG.

TUG'18 and PracTeX'18 published invitations to sponsors:
https://tug.org/tug2018/sponsor.html,
https://tug.org/practicaltex2018/sponsor.html.  Please consider
whether your organization would like to participate.

Speaking of organizations, I am pleased to announce that Nagwa
(https://www.nagwa.com), an education technology startup aiming to help
students around the globe, has become our newest institutional member.
Welcome aboard!  The current list of institutional members, and
information about joining, can be found at https://tug.org/instmem.html.

I still remember the old times when a TeX document could use any font,
provided that it was Computer Modern.  The situation has changed; by now
we have many free (and non-free) fonts of high quality.  During the last
several weeks CTAN (and thence TeX Live and MiKTeX) got several new
exciting fonts.

- Bob Tennent published Coelacanth, inspired by the famous
Centaur font (may I remind you about the book about Centaur by Jerry
Kelly and Misha Beletsky, recently reviewed in TUGboat,
http://tug.org/books/#kelly-beletsky ).

- Herbert Voss submitted the spark-otf package supporting Spark fonts,
useful for creation of sparklines (for more info, may I also refer you to
https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb38-2/tb119veytsman-sparklines.pdf ), and the
dejavu-otf package, with Dejavu fonts and support, in TrueType/OpenType.

- Andrew Cashner submitted musicography, which makes available a number
of musical symbols to pdf(la)tex users.

- A number of fonts have been updated as well: newtx and
xcharter by Michael Sharpe. And ... a new interview with Michael has just
been published at https://tug.org/interviews/sharpe.html. 

- Theppitak Karoonboonyanan updated Thai fonts in the fonts-tlwg package.
https://ctan.org/pkg/fonts-tlwg

- The indispensable fontspec & unicode-math packages by Will Robertson got
another set of updates too.

Looks like free font development is quite vibrant; thanks to all font
designers and TeXnicians for their great work.

Happy \TeX{}ing to all,
Boris Veytsman (TUG president)

Have LaTeX Project members abandoned the view that TeX

Well, I knew that.  The question is whether the old

Not at all but as always you can break the rules if you know what you
are doing (and I know what I'm doing:-) and more to the point avoiding
brace groups to help interface to a parser looking for a "1"  is
somewhat outside the scope of what standard latex syntax with
mandatory {} around mandatory arguments is designed to deal with.

Subject: [texhax] undertilde and MiKTeX
Message-ID: <0354d202-acc1-2052-42d8-5cc2cedf8e14@auckland.ac.nz>


The journal of which I am Technical Editor provides a document class 
file which implements the style conventions that papers published in the
journal must meet.

This document class makes use of the "\undertilde" command.  Apparently 
there are licensing issues with the undertilde package, and for this 
reason (I think) my installation of texlive has no undertilde.sty file,
but rather a file undertilde.tex.  Explicitly:

  /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/genmisc/undertilde.tex

For *that* reason the document class file for the journal uses

     \input{undertilde}

rather than

     \usepackage{undertilde}

An author contacted me just now saying that he is getting an error

     > File `undertilde.tex' not found. \input{undertilde}

This author is using TeXstudio which is a front end for MiKTeX.

I have difficulty investigating this problem, since I
*don't do Windoze* !!!  However some Googling indicates that MiKTeX 
should indeed have access to undertilde.

The curly is that one Google hit appears to indicate that MiKTeX 
possesses undertilde.sty and another that it possesses undertilde.tex.
These files would appear to live in

    ...\texmf\tex\generic\genmisc

(a) Can someone who uses Windoze/MiKTeX please confirm whether either or 
both of the files undertilde.sty and undertilde.tex are present?  Where 
they should be?

(b) It strikes me that it is possible that some releases of MiKTeX have
undertilde.sty and some (older ones perhaps?) have undertilde.tex.

If this is indeed the case I would like to be able to construct a 
conditional input something along the lines of:

   if(the file undertilde.sty is found) {
       \usepackage{undertilde}
   } else if(the file undertilde.tex is found) {
       \input{undertilde}
   } else {
       Bail out with a message "undertilde not available"
   }

Can some clever person instruct me (monosyllabically; I'm a Bear of Very 
Little Brain) as to how to construct such a conditional?

Eternally grateful.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

I had to get a basic business-class Windows laptop for just this kind
of problem.  The journal should provide you with one, unless you are
independent in which case you may as well get one yourself.  They don't
have to cost much, and if you plug in an external keyboard then a
laptop is almost tolerable to work with.  Windows Update is a major
pain, though.

Hi Rolf - regarding undertilde.sty (+ .dtx), I had to remove it from TL
after 2010 because no license was stated (i.e., no permissions granted
to do anything). Maybe someone would like to contact the author,
Benjamin Bayart?

Regarding undertilde.tex, I accidentally left it in because it was part
of the TL genmisc package instead of being its own
package. Unfortunately it too has no license information, and the author
is unknown. However, clearly it is derived from plain.tex's \underbrace,
so I guess it can be argued that it is under the same knuthian
license. Sigh.

Regarding MiKTeX, I think you can find file lists at miktex.org, or
certainly as part of the protext zip file (which is miktex + special
installer), linked from http://tug.org/protext.

Hope this helps,
Karl

Did he install the file in his current working directory or somewhere
else?

If it's installed somewhere else, the filename database (ls-R on
Unix, don't know how it's named under MiKTeX) has to be updated.  

Ask him to copy the file to the directory containing his LaTeX files.
This should always work.

The only file that he *installed* was the document class file 
anzsauth.cls.  I'm pretty sure that he put it "in the right place".
MiKTeX is finding the document class file OK.  What it *can't* find is 
undertilde.tex --- which should (???) be part of the MiKTeX installation.

Yes, I believe it should.  But I want to set things up so that the
anzsauth document class will work seamlessly for everybody without their 
having to mess around.

I think that what I really need is that conditional structure that I 
enquired about, and do not have sufficient skill to implement myself.
I would really appreciate it if someone could give me a recipe for doing 
this.

\newread \undertilde

\openin \undertilde = undertilde.sty

\ifeof \undertilde

\closein \undertilde

\openin \undertilde = undertilde.tex

\ifeof \undertilde

\closein \undertilde

\let \next = \relax

      \else

\closein \undertilde

\def \next {\input undertilde.tex}

      \fi

\else

\closein \undertilde

      \def \next {\usepackage {undertilde}}

\fi

\next

Both are present.

C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\tex\latex\undertilde\undertilde.sty

you could do that, but to be honest undertilde package is only 5 lines
of code, so less than the code you would need to conditionally include
it, it also has a few issues (the tilde always comes from the same
(displaystyle) font, unlike \widetide if amsmath is loaded)
I think it would be better just to put a (any) definition of under
tilde directly in your class rather than have dependencies on packages
not generally available.

It seems to be a MiKTeX problem.  No problems with TeX Live.

  $ kpsewhich undertilde.tex
    /xopt/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/tex/generic/genmisc/undertilde.tex

The log file generated by

  \documentclass{article}
  \input{undertilde.tex}
  \stop

contains the line

  (/xopt/texlive/2017/texmf-dist/tex/generic/genmisc/undertilde.tex)

It seems that everything works as expected within TeX Live.  If it
doesn't work under MiKTeX, please file a bug report.

Does MiKTeX provide undertilde.tex at all?

Regards,
  Reinhard

Is this apparent contradiction as mysterious to others as it is to me?

Thanks to Philip Taylor and Peter Wilson who both answered my cri de 
coeur for a "conditional construction" to use the package undertilde.sty
if it's available and otherwise *input* undertilde.tex if *that* is
available.

However I haven't actually *tried* these suggestions, because David 
Carlisle wrote:

Now why didn't *I* think of that?  (Because I'm a Bear of Very Little 
Brain, I guess!)

Anyhow I'm going with David Carlisle's suggestion as being simplest
and most robust.

Thanks to all who responded to my plea for help.

cheers,
