Message-ID: <3914bc1a-f73d-452f-b00b-2af6f444c2aa@gmx.de>

Hi folks,

I need advice on how to typeset algorithms in computer science papers 
(not a specific journal yet).

In short, algorithms consist of some keywords (usually typeset bold, 
though I personally dislike the very strong emphasis this gives), some 
prosa (usually typeset like the surrounding text), and some variables 
and named constants in mathematical or pseudo-mathematical expressions. 
It's those variables and constants I have problems with.

In mathematics, variables usually are one-glyph things (sometimes 
distinguished further by indizes and/or accents). In computer science, 
word-like variables and constants are very common, something TeX's math 
mode does not expect. How should I typeset those? Here's an example of 
what I have and what I don't like:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Here $pi$ is typeset as if it were meant as $p$ times $i$, and $euler$ 
is typeset as if it were meant as $e$ times $u$ times $l$ times $e$ 
times $r$.
\end{document}

Any ideas on how to solve that?

Thanks in advance,

Susan Dittmar

Why not use the TAOCP macros, Susan ?

Certainly never typeset multi-letter identifiers in math italic. At the
level just of choosing fonts you want \mathrm{pi} or \mathit{pi} or
\mathtt{pi} depending on what you want or perhaps better \var{pi} where
\var is defined to be any of those, so you can change your mind later about
what font to use for each category of symbol.

But many areas have existing packages (eg for Z) and there are several
packages designed for typesetting algorithms as pseudo-code which may also
be relevant.

I thought this was kind of a "lmgtfy" question but it does raise the larger question of
what text structures there are for describing algorithms ( similar to say bibtex or graphviz ) that could go into code
generators for latex or svg or machine learning for that matter. Once you have the portable
text you can feed it to various rendering widgets and see what you get.
Typesetting and documentation generation are better when they are more likely to match the
implementing code so anything that can generate both may help. 
 fwiw.

Hi all,

I'm puzzled with this description of -q option in "info dvips":

     Run quietly.  Don't chatter about pages converted, etc. to standard
     output; report no warnings (only errors) to standard error.

But standard output does not differ with and without using this option:

Dear friends in the TeX community,

June is definitely not a slow month in the TeX calendar.  We have
plenty of (good) news.


1.  The Board voted on the new officers.  Susan DeMeritt will be
    continuing as Secretary, Karl Berry takes over from Klaus H\"oppner
    as Treasurer, and Arthur Reutenauer has been elected as Vice
    President.  Thank you to all who served and congratulations to the
    new officers!


2.  On Sunday June 4, TeX Live 2017 (https://tug.org/texlive/) was
    released. The release files should make their way around CTAN in the
    next day or two.

    The new release has a number of new features; see
    https://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#news.
    I would like to mention the changes in the updmap system:
    hopefully this will make font installation less painful.

    Many thanks to Karl Berry and the whole TL team for their hard work!


3.  The ConTeXt Group and Pragma ADE are inviting submissions for the
    11th International ConTeXt Meeting, September 11--17, 2017 in
    Maibach, Germany.  The theme for the meeting is ConTeXt Gardening.
    As the organizers write,

	If you want to do an on-topic talk submission, there are
	plenty of angles to take at the theme: Seeding, weeding,
	fertilising, growing, harvesting, just to name a few.

	But anything at all related to ConTeXt that you would like to
	share is an acceptable subject for a presentation, tutorial,
	discussion, Q&A session, demonstration, workshop, recital,
	sketch, or sermon.

	The programme committee is Hans Hagen and Taco Hoekwater, feel
	free to email them with hints and ideas.

    Direct link to the registration form:
    http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2017/register.shtml
    Meeting website: http://meeting.contextgarden.net

    
4. TUG 2018, including the TUG AGM, will be held in Rio de Janeiro,
   Brazil, from July 20-22, 2018, as a satellite conference of the
   2018 International Congress of Mathematicians.
   
   https://tug.org/tug2018/ has some visa information, a preliminary
   call for papers, and some dates; more information will be posted as
   it becomes available, as usual.


5. TUGboat is accepting submissions for the next regular issue, vol.38,
   no.3.  The deadline is September 1.  Submissions are needed and welcome,
   particularly of (but not limited to) survey or introductory articles.

    
Happy TeXing!

Message-ID: <59489a4f.d64c190a.98fba.2061@mx.google.com>

Hi all,

It seems strange to me that using semicolon after "showit" causes an
extra call to blankrectangle() and updatescreen() functions from
online display driver.

I added printf() calls to x11-Xt.c driver and run "showit" without and
with trailing semicolon. The logs of these runs follow.

== Run 1 ==

user at debian:/usr/local/mf$ mf '\showit'
This is METAFONT, Version 2.7182818 (TeX Live 2017) (preloaded base=mf)

initscreen called

blankrectangle called, xl=0, xr=500, yt=0, yb=400

updatescreen called

*

== Run 2 ==

user at debian:/usr/local/mf$ mf '\showit;'
This is METAFONT, Version 2.7182818 (TeX Live 2017) (preloaded base=mf)

blankrectangle called, xl=0, xr=500, yt=0, yb=400

updatescreen called

blankrectangle called, xl=0, xr=500, yt=0, yb=400

Does anybody know why semicolon affects online display driver?

Igor

showit; expands to
  openit; display currentpicture inwindow currentwindow;

I guess both openit and display update the screen.

If the semicolon is omitted, MF does not yet know what
window the display command is supposed to display in.
There could something on the next line that continues the
command. For example,
  display currentpicture inwindow currentwindow
   - 1;

And so MF is not executing display, but waiting for more input.
If you supply a semicolon at the * prompt, I bet you would see
another updatescreen.

Cheers,
Dan

If I use the enumerate package, which redefines the enumerate environment in a useful way, is there an easy way to start it at a number other than 1 (or a,A,i,I)?  I have looked at the documentation, but I cannot understand it well enough to figure that out.

only same as in standard latex just stick \setcounter{enumi}[1001}
before the first item, but the enumitem package has a rather more
flexible key=value optional argument that allows specification of the
format  but also start values, and resuming from an earlier list or
whatever. So you might consider that instead of enumerate package.

Hi all,

I'm writing a book using LaTeX (TeX Shop).  Every so often there are one or more consecutive full-page Figures that are linked to the text using hyperref.  The reader must leaf through the pages to pick up the interrupted text and continue reading.  Is there package that will insert "(continued on page XX)" and "(continued from page YY)"?  And better yet, does it work with hyper ref so that one click on these notes will move to the referenced page?

I'd appreciate any direction that you can give.

Consider this package: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/jumplines

Maybe it will need some modifications.

Thanks for reading my question.  I had looked briefly at jumplines, but saw this in the documentation: 

"This package does not work with floating contents inside of the articles, however, floats outside of such articles are possible."

As I understand this, the floating figures, which are the source of my problem, preclude the use of jump lines.

As I understand, you problem is that the floating figures is interrupting
your text. I.e. your text needs jump lines and not the floating figures.
For example will have:

*Text here  (floating figure) text continued from before*

This may work with jumplines.

Almost every PDF viewer has a function (button/menu/key/...) "go back".
Such basic stuff can be expected from the user of a PDF viewer, can't it?

This function can also be used with `hyperref`:

   \Acrobatmenu{GoBack}{Text for going back.}

However, the named action "GoBack" is not part of the ISO standard,
at least it is recognized in Adobe Reader or xpdf, but not evince.

Using specific links is much more cumbersome. Usually, there are many
ways, a user has come to the image, e.g.:
* List of figures:
   [Go to previous figure]
   [Go to next figure]
   [Go to list of figures]

* References:
   [Go to reference 1 in chapter 1, section 4 on page 10]
   [Go to reference 2 in chapter 3, section 2 on page 40]
   [Go to reference 3 in chapter 3, section 2 on page 44]
   ...

I do not think that this is very practical or expected by the
user.

Yours sincerely
   Heiko Oberdiek

The problem is that these buttons are not necessary on the toolbar by
default. Say, in Acrobat on Mac to put them here one should go to the menu
View > Show/Hide > Toolbar Items > Show Page Navigation Tools > [and then
select items]. Alternatively one can use menu View > Page Navigation > . or
just use hot keys Cmd -> and Cmd <- (for page up and down there are hot
keys as well)

I'm looking at version 3.4.0 of Evince in a rather old
version of Ubuntu.  There is indeed an action labeled "back"
available for the toolbar, though not by default, that
serves, more or less, this function.  It seems to be
page-oriented rather than location-oriented.  Thus, in using
"back" to move to a page that is already partly visible, it
may appear that nothing happends.  It does stack a list of prior
pages.

Curiously there is no (default) menu item for this "back".
There are two menus for the toolbar: (a) View->Toolbar,
which controls whether the toolbar is display and
(b) Edit->Toolbar, which opens a window listing functions not
presently on the toolbar.  Functions may be dragged back and
forth between the toolbar itself and the edit-toolbar
window.

I hope this function has not been removed from more recent
versions of Evince.

Message-ID: <CAG-qkSrjpqUKeJ0tAkGxPb+oueD8Rh-prkzWYiouQe5pzsnObg@mail.gmail.com>

I've recently released a new JavaScript based builder called DiCy for
LaTeX, knitr and literate Haskell that automatically builds
dependencies. It can automatically process projects that utilize
Asymptote, Biber, BibTeX, dvitopdf, MetaPost, makeindex,
makeglossaries, or SageTeX. It also parses and filters output logs and
error messages generated during build.

It requires Node.js/npm and is currently available only via npm
installation. It's not on CTAN yet since it is still in beta.

For more information please see https://yitzchak.github.io/dicy/

To installation instructions please https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dicy/cli

Please submit bug reports or suggestions to
https://github.com/yitzchak/dicy/issues

Thanks,
Tarn Burton

Dear Tarn,
it would be nice if your program is available at CTAN though.  If you
think that it's not matured, the CTAN upload interface allows you to
add a comment.

If you upload something to CTAN, people who are subscribed to the
ctan-ann mailing list

  https://lists.dante.de/mailman/listinfo/ctan-ann

will be informed about new uploads and updates.  Thus, if you upload
your program to CTAN it gets more attraction and you probably get more
feedback from users.

Regards,
  Reinhard
