Subject: [texhax] Jan17 TUG news: election, conferences, membership, calendar,
	review
Message-ID: <201701120018.v0C0IF4s032730@freefriends.org>

Fellow TeX-ers,

It is dark here in the US.  Fortunately, there are lots of good things
in the TeX world, including a calendar on which to mark the days until
the thaw; see item 7.

0) But first, allow us to mention TUG memberships for the new year.  If
you've already renewed, or automatically renew your membership, thanks!
Otherwise, you can find the membership form and information at
http://tug.org/join.html, and would greatly appreciate your
consideration and support. This year we have doubled the discount for
electronic memberships to try to help where finances are a concern.

1) Also on the organizational front, this is an election year for TUG.
A number of seats on the Board expire in 2017, including that of
President; see http://tug.org/election/. 
The deadline for submissions is Feb 1, 2017, 5pm PST.

Note that this deadline is firm.  Direct inquiries to the election
committee, whose address is on that page.

Please consider running.  TUG depends on all of us to continue the
good work, and being on the Board is a great way to make a
contribution.

2) Next year's TUG conference will be at the annual BachoTeX
conference April 29-May 3, 2017.  We will be joining the Polish TeX
group GUST for their 25th birthday. More information will be appearing
in this newsletter and at http://tug.org/tug2017/.

If you are thinking about your trip I urge you to read the page,
"Things you always wanted to know about Bachotek" at
http://tug.org/tug2017/bachotex.html.

3) Very important: the deadline for Bursary Fund applications for the
TUG conference is January 15, 2017.  This fund helps members of the
TeX community who would, for financial reasons, otherwise be unable to
attend a TUG conference.  Full information is on
http://tug.org/bursary/.

(Please consider making a donation to the TUG Bursary Fund. One
hundred percent of the money donated is used to help people attend the
conference.  Thanks for your consideration.)

4) With the end of the year, we have ended the year's membership
campaign (http://tug.org/membership/).  Thanks to all TUG members who
invited others to join and to our new members.  And congratulations to
the winner of the drawing, Doug Marmion, who will receive a limited
edition of *Manuale Zapficum, 2009: Typographic arrangements of the
words by and about the work of Hermann Zapf & Gudrun Zapf von Hesse*
from RIT Press.

5) The next TUGboat is a regular issue, 38:1; the submission deadline is
February 24, 2017.  Submissions are most welcome, particularly of 
introductory and survey articles.

6) Looking forward, the 11th ConTeXt meeting will take place at
Butzbach-Maibach, Germany, on September 11-17, 2017.  The theme will
be ConTeXt Gardening. See http://meeting.contextgarden.net/2017/.

This meeting will host ConTeXt and LuaTeX developers as well as users.
It gives you the chance to present your results, experiences, and
ideas on future development. The talks will be followed by tutorials
on ConTeXt and LuaTeX techniques.

7) Peter Wilson of Herries Press has prepared a 2017 calendar of
historical Japanese woodblocks.  The a4 version is at
http://tug.org/calendar/17/tug-cal17-a4.pdf, and the US letter version
is at http://tug.org/calendar/17/tug-cal17-letter.pdf.

8) Boris Veytsman has done another review, this time of the seminar
*Presenting data and information* by Edward Tufte.  Many TeX-ers will
know Tufte's work, and the review is fascinating. See
http://tug.org/books/reviews/tb118reviews-tufte.html.

Happy TeXing,
Jim Hefferon, for the TUG Board

Hello my name is Thanasis. I send you an email because I cannot figure out
how to install Tex Live in Ubuntu (xenial). I use MikTex in Windows 10 and
I am new in a Unix environment. I have seen the site but there are vast
information.

Firstly, I have downloaded the install-tl-unx.tar.gz.  I continued and read
the site Quick Install but I did not understand a lot. How can I proceed?

Thank you very much,

Hi Thanasis,

the easiest way should be to use Ubuntu's Software
Centre. Just search for "texlive" or "texlive-full" (the
latter gives you a complete TeX Live distribution). See also
https://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html, under "Installing
the Debian/Ubuntu packages".

kind regards
     Enrico

Message-ID: <BLUPR16MB02584B0BA125643B02036D09A07C0@BLUPR16MB0258.namprd16.prod.outlook.com>

I just downloaded the install-tl-windows.exe for Windows from https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html for my Win XP.  It has been a big hassle to install it.  I think at least part of the problems is that an outdated version of perl - perl522.dll (and maybe other files as well) was included in \install-tl-20170116\tlpkg\tlperl\bin.  The installer looked for perl524.dll !

Hi all,

I posted this to the Texlive mailing list, but this seems to be a more 
appropriate forum.

Am using the Funnelweb literate programming tool, producing Tex output.

In some code I have, I need to insert ASCII code 25 in the C source 
code.

This works fine as far as producing the C code, but when I run Latex on 
the .tex file, I get:

| ! Text line contains an invalid character.
| l.1573
...
| ^^Y

The relevant piece of the .tex file is:

| \fwbtx[
...
| ^Y
...
| ]

(in Emacs; the ^Y is one character, not two)

and the "fwbtx" macro is defined as:

| \def\fwbtx[{%
| \begingroup%
| \def\par{\leavevmode\endgraf}%
| \catcode`\`=\active%
| \obeylines%
| \def\do##1{\catcode`##1=12 }\dospecials%
| \obeyspaces
| \parskip=0pt%
| \tt%
| \fwverbatimgobble}

| \def\fwverbatimgobble#1]fwetx={#1\endgroup}

which, I believe, is supposed to escape all non-ASCII characters, so 
that Tex does not complain.

Can anybody explain what goes wrong?

Is there some simple work-around? Replace the "fwbtx" macro with 
something?

Any help appreciated.

/Tomas

I would like to use currency symbols from as many countries as possible,
(beyond those from the textcomp package).

I am especially interested in currency symbols from Israel, China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.

Are there Latex (not XeLatex or LuaLatex) code for currencies from these countries?

If yes, where are they available?

Is there a complete list of currency symbols available/possible in Latex?

If yes, where is it available?

I use LaTex via TexLive 2016 as well as  Miktex 2.9.

In addition to fonts, you may find it easier with pdftex to use
images, just collect images (.pdf, or .png or whatever)  for each
currency and then you can use

\includeraphics[height=1.2ex]{currency-of-abc}123

to include an image of the abc currency symbol scaled to something
relative to the current font size.

Subject: [texhax] How to change fonts for numbers vs. letters
Message-ID: <20170130151318.789d03d6@ulgy_thing>

Hello,
I selected a cool font in Latex but the numbers are offset from each
other. For example, the 2 is larger than the one in the number 12, like
this:
1 2
  2

I could select another font, or repeatedly switch, but I'd like to know
if I can use a different font for number vs. letters/punctuation.

Thanks,
David

See the "newunicode" package for a way to map unicode symbols to

You should look at the font properties to see if it offers a choice between lining and non-lining numerals; if it does, you may be able to instruct it to use your preferred variant.  Since you are using LaTeX, of which I am completely ignorant, I cannot suggest /how/ you would "instruct it to use your preferred variant", as that is LaTeX-specific.

Alternatively, if you are using XeLaTeX, you could use \XeTeXinterchartoks and friends to elegantly handle the transition between non-numerals and numerals and back again.

It would be nice if you could tell us what this "cool font"
is because your description of the problem makes no sense
to me.  I suppose you mean wider rather than "larger"?

I suppose one could create a virtual font.

I'm resurrecting a thread from back in October (month 10--two digits--this
is of consequence).  My challenge was this:

I am using R and Sweave and MikTeX on Windows 7.  I use this workflow
to generate a recurring report quarterly. Same report, just new data.

The R code generates a graph, saving it as a pdf file, the filename
including the system date., like this:

<timeseriesplot, results=hide, echo=FALSE>>=
# make the major graph
pdf(file=paste("
NaloxoneUseEMS-timeseriesplot-", Sys.Date(), ".pdf",
sep=""), height=8, width=12)
## bunch of R code in here to create a graph
dev.off()
@


  Each time I run the report, the name of the saved pdf file changes, to
match the system date. I want to include the
most current graph in my pdf output.

William Adams kindly provided this excellent solution:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{datenumber}

\begin{document}

NaloxoneUseEMS-timeseriesplot-\thedateyear-\thedatemonth-\thedateday

\end{document}


Which worked very well for a while.  But now that it is January (month 1,
or 01, and there is the crux of the problem) it no longer does.  Here is
part of the latex error message that provides a clue:


ERROR: LaTeX Error: File `ERROR: LaTeX Error: File `ERROR: LaTeX Error:
File `NaloxoneUseEMS-timeseriesplot-2017-1-31' not found.


So it appears that the Latex package datenumber is searching for the
graphics file called


NaloxoneUseEMS-timeseriesplot-2017-1-31.pdf (which of course does not exist)



whereas my R code is creating the graphics file called


NaloxoneUseEMS-timeseriesplot-2017-01-31.pdf (which was successfully
created and is sitting in the proper directory.)


Can I make datenumber use 2 digits for \thedatemonth?


Thanks.
