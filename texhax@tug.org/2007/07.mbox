Subject: [texhax] old TeX
Message-ID: <000601c7bbde$fb392ab0$0302a8c0@Elizabeth>


Hullo

In the 1990s, I used TeX quite a lot. This means that I now have a number of files which are in TeX but that I can't open on my more recent desktop and laptop computers. 

I am a technical incompetent (as well as, pretty much, a TeXnichal incompetent). I do have all my old discs somewhere, I think, but when I last tried to download TeX from them (a year or more ago) I got something wrong. So, I wanted to download TeX from the internet. 

But I don't know 
1) my old licence number or if I can still use the old licence

2) which format to download - although I use pcs now, with windows, it's Plain TeX that I know how to write and use, not MiXTeX or LaTeX - can I download good old Plain TeX? 


3) How to get in touch with UK-TUG, whose webpage seems to have expired.

Any help you can offer would be gratefully received.

Thanks

Elizabeth

Message-ID: <A45FA472-E555-4797-A8AC-875A0FDC4798@tufts.edu>

I am trying to use the \sideset option to create a macro which prints  
one argument (say v) inside brackets, with a "subscript", on the left  
of the left bracket.  The code for the macro is
************************************************************************ 
**********
\newcommand{\matrepvec}[2]{\ensuremath{\sideset{_{#1}}{}{\operatorname 
{\lbrack #2\rbrack}}}}
************************************************************************ 
*************

It gives me the effect I want, but has curious behavior with respect  
to variable #2:  when I
invoke

$\matrepvec{B}{\vec{v}}$

I get not v surmounted by an arrow, but v tilde (or something like  
it) inside the brackets.  What is causing this?

TeX is free software. You don't need any license number.

MikTeX is a distribution of TeX, which means it makes available  
several common TeX formats, including Plain TeX (as well as LaTeX and  
ConTeXt). A version of MikTeX with some documentation that talks you  
through how to install it is ProTeXt: http://www.tug.org/protext/

You don't need a licence for TeXLive or Miktex.

Plain TeX is part of any TeX distribution.   You can process your
documents with tex (producing dvi) or pdftex (producing pdf).

For Windows there are two distributions:

    http://tug.org/texlive

    http://miktex.org

Yes, the link to the webpage doesn't work.  Mit maybe the email

Subject: [texhax] Makeindex ith German Umlaut
Message-ID: <4688155D.9010008@fh-bingen.de>

Hi,
I got the following problem with Makeindex:

\index{?quidistant}
yields an entry
\indexentry{\"aquidistant|hyperpage}{152}

which Makeindex sorts under Symbole (Symbols) and not under A.

The option -g of Makeindex would sort
\indexentry{"aquidistant|hyperpage}{152}
correctly but does not sort
\indexentry{\"aquidistant|hyperpage}{152} as I did expect!

There is the obvious way around
\index{aquidistant@?quidistant}
but there are a lot of these Umlaute, so I am looking fpr a better way.

Also I a made all Umlaute written as "a ... when writing the .tex to 
disk. But then I got strange indexentries by Latex:

\newcommand{\Index}[1]{#1\index{#1}}
\Index{Vollst"andigkeit}
translated to
\indexentry{Vollst\active at dq  \dq at prtct{a}ndigkeit|hyperpage}{2}
which Makeindex did not like:

!! Input index error (file = Skr.idx, line = 14):
    -- Extra `@' at position 22 of first argument.

and I do not understand at all!

Any suggestions what could cause this and how to come around?

For information my Makeindex style file:

quote '+'
headings_flag 1
heading_prefix "\\textbf{\\large "
heading_suffix "} \\nopagebreak%\n \\vspace{.5ex} \\nopagebreak\n"
symhead_positive "Symbole"

Well, that's what you get for "misusing" macros (the ams manual does warn
you).

Try looking at the "tensor" package; the following should then provide what
you want:

\newcommand{\matrepvec}[2]{\ensuremath{\tensor[_{#1}]{\lbrack #2\rbrack}{}}}

And if you want the letter "v" in Roman and not math italics (you did notice
that didn't you?*) then use, eg,

$\matrepvec{B}{\vec{\mathrm{v}}}$

Cheers,  Phil

email addresses like

Replace \operatorname with \mathop. \operatorname shifts to text font, 
and this confuses \vec.

Well, two major / well-known free ones.

There're a number of other commercial distributions (PC TeX, TrueTeX  
&c.) and a couple of other free ones (most notably W32TeX, http://

No offense meant, just trying to keep things as compleat and

Hello All,

I am trying to recreate an old version of our software that assumes an old 
version of Knuth's plain.tex (together with the version of hyphen.tex that 
accompanied it).  I have searched the Internet for plain.tex Version 
3.1415926 (together with hyphen.tex) with no success.  Does anyone have a 
copy of these two files that they could email back to me?

With great appreciation in advance!
Brian O'Toole

I found it on the TeXLive-7 CD (issued in 2002).

  \def\fmtname{plain}\def\fmtversion{3.1415926} % identifies the current format

It's now on my server (plain.tex and hyphen.tex):

  http://ms25.ath.cx/plaintex-3.1415926.zip

To be honest, I suppose that the changes Knuth made in 3.14159265 are
quite small and it is unlikely that they break existing software.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Try looking at the original definition: under MiKTeX you'll find it in
latex.ltx (I don't know about other distros).  However, beware, as you'll
see, this is not stuff for novices.

Message-ID: <95C766F2-3F52-49E7-A0C2-67037CA3CDFD@auckland.ac.nz>



I have a pair of large tables (both of which I include in a single  
table environment) that
are a bit long for a page (even when rotated).   The page number  
appears in between the
two tables, and I would like to simply suppress it.  But I can't  
figure out how to do this.
Using \thispagestyle{empty} seems not to work, nor do other ideas  
which have been
suggested to me.

Can rotating.sty be hacked so as to make the page number not be  
printed?  Well, I'm sure it
can --- it's just that I don't speak TeX well enough to work out how  
to do this.

Would it be possible for someone to give me a simple recipe for such  
a hack?

TIA.

				cheers,

					Rolf

Try floatpag package, part of sttools; you can find the documentation in

.../texmf-dist/doc/latex/sttools

Read presfull.pdf (page 3 explains the use of floatpag.sty).

I think this does what you want (though it could probably be written

\def\hola{\@ifstar\holastar\onea}
\def\holastar{\@ifnextchar[\threea\twoa}
\def\threea[#1]#2{#1\quad{\itshape#2}}
\def\twoa#1{{\bfseries#1}\quad{\sffamily#1}}
\def\onea#1{{\itshape#1}}

You were warned.

Hi,

how do I write an equation that spans over multiple pages? I use
\begin{eqnarray*} environment, but this breaks on \end{eqnarray*}, I would
like to have whole equation in one environment and that it would break nice
on multiple pages; Like longtable does for tables.

I write my diploma in LaTeX, and has long proof to be written and I have not
found a solution for this in weeks.

I suppose you mean a long series of equations. You should check the 
environments in the amsmath package. They are better than eqnarray 
anyway, which is evil anyway[0].

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0707041822040.6248@pcct95.ct.infn.it>

Hi,

I need to produce a good quality PDF out of a DVI for a conference book of 
abstracts, using Computer Modern forms and including several ps and eps 
pictures.

My publisher needs to import my PDF into Corel Draw (to format it before 
printing).

However, most fonts are not properly converted, and the final output is 
unacceptable.

I think that the solution might be to embed all fonts in the PDF, but I 
was not able to do it properly (using dvipdfm, at least).

Any help will be appreciated.

Please, reply directly to my address, as well as to the mailing list, as I 
receive replies in digested format.

Many thanks in advance!

Giuseppe.

Section 3.9 of amsldoc describes how to achieve breaks within equation 
groups like this. However, note that a break there should be discouraged 
--- it will make it harder to follow the sequence, I'd say.

The same way as with latex. Use option fleqn. Adding it as a class 
option should work, if not, load the amsmath package with that option also.

	Yew Bewdy!!!  It works.  Thanks a million!

	Explicitly, for the benefit of bunnies like me, what is necessary is  
to include:

	\usepackage{floatpag}
	\rotfloatpagestyle{empty}

	in the preamble.

	Thanks again.

Use ps2pdf with the prepress flag. You can use ps2pdf on 
pdf-files as well -- even though the name suggests otherwise.

ps2pdf14 -dPDFSETTINGS#/prepress nofonts.pdf allfonts.pdf

On Liunx/unix systems the `#' should be a `='.

Most likely the publisher is in the habit of doing this because  
they're too cheap to purchase a real imposition system or PDF RIP.

No, the publisher hasn't properly loaded the used fonts so that  
they're accessible to CorelDRAW.

No, CorelDRAW isn't a .pdf editor, it's a drawing program which will  
interpret a .pdf to its native format, then fall back on native/ 
systemic font support (i.e., those fonts which are made available by  
the operating system and any installed font utilities _and_ using the  
native font encoding).

> Any help will be appreciated.

Which fonts are you using?

You may be able to work with this by using the OpenType version of  
Latin Modern and having the publisher install the freely  
distributed .otf files.

Failing that, wash the files through GhostScript w/ settings to  
convert all type to outlines. The publisher may have to fall back to  
processing one or a range of pages --- I think there's a total number  
of objects limitation in CorelDRAW you may run into.

Hello All,

I am trying to recreate several historical bugs in our local TeX system, and 
it has become apparent to me that the easist way for me to do this would be 
to find an old copy of TeX Live.  I am searching for TeX Live from the era 
in which tex.web 3.14159, tangle.web 4.4, and weave.web 4.4, and mf.web 
2.7182 were current (My guess is that this would be around 2001 or 2002). 
Does anyone have a copy that they could point me to for ftp?

Thanks very much!

Hello All,

As I have tried to reproduce bugs in our TeX system, I have discovered on 
the 'Net two different files that both identify themselves as weave.web 
Version 4.4.  I realize that any desired customization may be accomplished 
with weave.ch, but I am surprised to find two versions of the 
Knuth-developed file.  The current CTAN version shows lines 4811-4812 as:

    loop at +  begin print_nl('#'); update_terminal; {prompt}
      read(term_in,ddt); {read a debug-command code}

Yet, other versions on the 'Net show lines 4811-4812 as:

    loop at +  begin write(term_out,'#'); update_terminal; {prompt}
      read(term_in,ddt); {read a list of integers}

Does anyone know how this happened?  Did Knuth make a fix and keep the 
Version at 4.4?  If Knuth made such a fix, do you know when he did so?

Thanks,
Brian

Using CM fonts only:

  \def\textordfeminine{$^{\hbox{\underbar{$\scriptstyle \rm a$}}}$}

If you can use a TS1 font, you can get a real glyph:

  \font\tents=ts1-lmr10
  \let\ts\tents
  \def\textordfeminine{{\ts\char"AA}}

You might want to ensure that \ts is set according to the current font
face (bold/italic/slanted/etc.), e.g., by redefining \bf, \it, \sl,
etc.

This is how you can get a font table:

  $ tex testfont

Best,
Oleg

This is interesting, but it then asks you for a font name, and what name

add the lines:

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}

to your preamble so that the .pdf is using Latin Modern to begin with.

Via private mailing, a helpful friend points out that it's looking for
the name of the file containing the font, either with or without the
".afm".  Stupidly, I was just trying "cmr" without the "10" or "7" and
also things like "Palatino", thinking that this is the "name" of the
font.  ("Helvetica" works, as it happens, which just makes things more
confusing.)

So Oleg's answer might have been:

  This is how you can get a font table:

    $ tex testfont

  And then give it the name of the font file you're interested in.
  Which you can find by looking for .afm files.

Any name you'd use in the \font command -- this is where testfont's
macros eventually use it.  For example, cmr10.  Just search your
system for all .tfm files, and use their base names (without the path
and the .tfm extension).  List them with something like this:

  $ find $TEXMF/fonts/tfm | grep 'tfm$'

TEXMF should be set to the path to your TeX installation root (for me
it's /usr/share/texmf-texlive).  Some fonts might also be installed in
your local TEXMF tree(s), usually /usr/local/share/texmf and/or texmf
under your home dir.

Best,
Oleg

P.S.  Below is a quick script which automates the steps.  Just say

  $ testfont cmr10

and you should see xdvi pop up displaying the font table.

------------------------------%<------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: `basename $0` <font_name>" >&2
  exit 1
fi

set -e
TMPFILE=`tempfile`
echo '\input testfont' > $TMPFILE
cd `dirname $TMPFILE`
tex `basename $TMPFILE` <<EOF
$1
\table\bye
EOF
xdvi `basename $TMPFILE`

Shouldn't this be ".tfm"?  I don't think TeX understands .afm's (Adobe
Font Metric files), at least not the "vanilla" TeX.  In fact, there's
an afm2tfm program (written by Tomas Rokicki and Donald E. Knuth).

There is a mapping in some font map file which maps "Helvetica" to
the "real" font name.

Sorry, I should have been more verbose :).

Yes, of course.  My blunder again, because I have a "Helvetica.afm" file
and I haven't ever really understood all the complexities of fonts.  As
is by now glaringly obvious to the world.

Aha.  See above.

So multiple related equations.

But eqnarray and eqnarray* DO allow page breaks in the middle!
There is some critical information you are not revealing.
Have you used \samepage anywhere? Have you changed 
\interdisplaylinepenalty? Are you using amsmath?

(amsmath disallows breaks by default. Use \allowdisplaybreaks
to allow.)

    There is a mapping in some font map file which maps "Helvetica" to
    the "real" font name.

Do you think so?  It's possible, but it would be the "aliases" file
rather than a .map file per se (.map files mostly map tfm names to
.pfb/.ttf/.whatever to include).  And we removed the aliases file a
couple years ago in TL, though I dunno about other distributions.

My first guess would be that there is a file Helvetica.tfm on the system.

Presence or absence of .afm files is definitely immaterial.

Hi Brian,

    two different files that both identify themselves as weave.web 
    Version 4.4.

That is surprising to me too.

    Did Knuth make a fix and keep the Version at 4.4?

I hope so, because I'd be depressed if someone else made the change.

    If Knuth made such a fix, do you know when he did so?

No idea, but you might check the tarballs at
ftp://tug.org/historic/systems/knuth.

(See also my answer to your other msg.)

    I am trying to recreate several historical bugs in our local TeX system, and 

It seems it is quite the exercise!

    in which tex.web 3.14159, tangle.web 4.4, and weave.web 4.4, and mf.web 
    2.7182 were current (My guess is that this would be around 2001 or 2002). 
    Does anyone have a copy that they could point me to for ftp?

ftp://tug.org/historic/systems/teTeX
ftp://tug.org/historic/systems/texlive
You might poke around elsewhere in /historic/ too.

Another possibility is ftp://ftp.cs.stanford.edu/pub/tex, the ftp site
for Knuth's originals.  I'm not sure how many old versions he has there,
but at a glance it seems there are some.

Good luck,
Karl

There is no Helvetica.tfm on the system, but there is a
$TEXMF/fonts/map/dvips/psnfss/psnfss.map with a line like this:

  phvr8r Helvetica "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc 

Could that be a mapping from "Helvetica" to "phvr8r.tfm"?  When I use
the names in that file, they all work, except for two (EURB10 and
EURM10), which doesn't seem like a ringing endorsement of the
hypothesis, but there seem to be a lot of map files, many of which seem
similar.  Certainly not all the mappings I see in those files work.

This is a tetex distribution, downloaded shortly before they were
discontinued. 

Incidentally, feel free to let it lie.  There is no compelling question
at stake here, beyond my curiosity about how the system I rely on works
under the covers.

    $TEXMF/fonts/map/dvips/psnfss/psnfss.map with a line like this:

      phvr8r Helvetica "TeXBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc 

That won't make "Helvetica" work as an input to testfont.tex.  TeX
doesn't even read that file.  What that is doing is telling dvips that
the PostScript FontName corresponding to phvr8r.tfm is "Helvetica", so
it can output the proper .ps.

    Incidentally, feel free to let it lie.  There is no compelling question

Well, now I am curious too.  "Helvetica" works as the input to
testfont.tex for me too, and I didn't expect this.

kpsewhich Helvetica.tfm returns 
/n/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/cspsfonts-adobe/helvetic/rphvr.tfm

Ok, so it is found (in a rather odd location).

kpsewhich --debug=-1 Helvetica.tfm outputs a ton of stuff.  Searching
for rphvr in the output, I see it comes right after reading
/n/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/fonts/map/fontname/texfonts.map.
I'm guessing this is what is happening for you too.

When I replied before, I forgot about that feature I implemented long
ago :).  It probably isn't a good idea these days, but the idea was to
let people use the PostScript names and deal with other font name
(in)compatibilities, like the annoying [l]circ/circle madness.

However, those "raw" fonts, now being found in the "Czech/Slovakian
PostScript font support" package
(http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=cspsfonts)
used to be an integral part of the PS font support, but not any more.
Furthermore, they are useless for typesetting.  If you use the \text
command to testfont.tex, you'll see there are no ligatures, etc.  And
the Type1 fonts don't get used either.  So it's not good for those names
to be supported.

I think I am going to delete texfonts.map from fontname and TL and we'll
see if anyone notices.

Thanks :).

I just installed TeXLive 2007 on a new computer.  It took me forever to
discover that the previewer was dviout instead of yap.  All the
documentation comes in html files which will not load on my browser
(Mozilla, I just get a few headers and pages of ?).  When I tried to use
IE, it wanted to load Japanese fonts.  If it is going to be in Kanji, I am
not interested.  The user interface appears to be awful (there seems to be
no key that just scrolls through the file).  Is there any usable
documentation for dviout?  Or can I just install yap?

If yap works better for you, go for it.  There's no reason not to use it.
(I have no clue if there will be configuration or other issues.)

I didn't think yap was ever part of TL -- but that it was the usual
previewer with MiKTeX.

Subject: [texhax] LaTeX bibliography woes.
Message-ID: <4691C917.30106@project7.ru>

I'm typesetting an old thesis of mine in LaTeX, partly to ensure I
finally have a good looking pdf to show off (the old one was done in
Word) and partly to build a workflow I could later hand over to my
less-savvy brother who has to submit a work with very similar
requirements soon in a related field. And I keep stumbling into more and
more problems.

According to local thesis-writing tradition and rules:

1) The citations have to be formatted in a very particular BibTeX style.
(Someone else wrote that one already, thankfully.)
2) All citations must both be present completely as footnotes and in the
list at the end.
3) The list at the end must be subdivided into sections by type of
source cited, where 'type' does not mean BibTeX record type.

I'm also working under these constraints:

* Everything has to be in utf-8. Single-byte encodings are taboo for
multiple good reasons, we can't go back and in fact haven't been back
for years.
* I have to use XeLaTeX, for the extra fonts.

First I've had the problem of BibTeX chewing up utf-8 when attempting to
abbreviate names. I've solved this by preventing it from abbreviating
names and making sure all names in the .bib file are already abbreviated
-- though I'm looking into Pybtex, which claims to be capable of working
with utf-8 and processing original BibTeX style files.

The problem of putting the references into footnotes was solved with the
bibentry package, which is part of natbib. It didn't play nice with
hyperref, and more importantly, it didn't play nice with the particular
style I have to use, since it defines new commands at the start of the
.bbl, which bibentry bypassed somehow. I've solved this by encapsulating
them all into a package which juggles them into correct order.

But this is nowhere near the end, since I now have to subdivide the
list, and none of the packages which purport to do that can work
together with bibentry -- as far as I can make out from LaTeX code,
which I don't claim to understand, it depends on the existence of a
single \thebibliography environment which it somehow lifts the full
citation text out of. It didn't play nicely with any of them.

I've tried biblatex, which says it was meant to do all of that together
and more, but it seems to reliably choke on all the utf-8 symbols I need
to localize it for Russian, and it chokes on \CYR<whatever> commands
declared by babel too. The error message about an unexpected paragraph
break leaves me with no clue. I can't go that way unless someone
explains me what could be wrong.

I've considered writing a script to process the .bbl file after it has
been generated to split it into sections and sort it properly -- if that
even works with bibentry. Experiments in manually altering the .bbl seem
to suggest it might, but I'm not sure how to do it in such a way as to
prevent it from starting every \thebibliography section from a new page
with the big "Literature" heading, and I don't think subsections are
possible within itemized environments.

What do I do?

P.S. In case it matters, I'm running TexLive 2007 on Linux with extra
packages pulled off CTAN.

Well, it should come with the "memoir" package itself.  You can certainly

See http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/
The whole 300 page book/manual is there as a PDF file.
I don't remember having to download the memoir class file when
I used it -- I think it was already part of the MiKTeX distribution.

The .pdf manual for this, as well as the .dtx file of commented  
source code from which one can install the documentclass are freely  
downloadable and included in most TeX distributions:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/

If you need a printed copy I'm afraid you'd have to make it yourself  
or upload it to one of the print on-demand places and pay for it  
(hmm, that's an interesting idea on a way for TUG to make money....)

I've a list of free references for TeX here:

http://members.aol.com/willadams/books-e-tex.html

Which may be of interest as well.

The macro below works, sort of.  We use it to define many (about 20)

he has a development version or something.

    I've considered writing a script to process the .bbl file after it has

Indeed.  It seems to me that there is nothing premade which can split up
the bbl into your arbitrary sectioning, in which case you'll just have
to do it with your own script.

    I don't think subsections are possible within itemized environments.

If that's right, my low-tech fix would be not to use \subsection.  Just
kludge in your own macro that formats the heading accordingly.
\medskip\leftline{\bf ...} comes to mind :).

	Well, unless anyone can give me an obvious reason which I missed (it
breaks on \CYRA, which is the encoding-independent way used throughout
babel, so it might be something fundamental about scoping which I don't
understand yet) I guess I will have to go directly to the author...

	All the packages that do the splitting, except the ones that split
citations by chapter, don't attempt to do it automatically either,
they're assuming you'll give them several files instead. Right now I'm
thinking of having an extra field in the .bib, which should make it neater.

> From this comment, I'm imagining you want output like this:

	Yes, that's exactly what I'm looking for, though I'd rather not kludge
around it like you described. I noticed that if I split \thebibliography
within the .bbl file by ending and restarting it, full citations in
footnotes still work fine -- but every time the environment stops and
restarts, it starts on a new page with a chapter-level heading, and
restarts the list numbering. If I somehow manage to prevent that, I
could use normal section headings.

> Sounds like quite an adventure ...

	With all it's power, LaTeX offers a surprising number of cases where
it's "my way or the highway" as soon as you try to write a long text in
anything which doesn't fit into Latin-1. This is by far not the first of
my problems, just the one that's taking the longest to fix. The  only
consolation is that once they're fixed they tend to stay fixed.

Hi All,

I would like to know if it is possible to pass command line arguments to a Latex document. If yes, then how is it done?

Any advice/tips is greatly appreciated.

Not really, but you can use the following hack (it is for plain TeX,
but I think it should work with LaTeX, too):

----------%<---------- test.tex ----------%<----------
\message{\jobname: \testparam}
\bye
----------%<---------- test.tex ----------%<----------

Then compile like this:

  $ tex '\def\testparam{This is a test parameter.}\input test.tex '

	Well, I'm finished with the sorting script, and it works, for suitably
small quantities of 'works'... The only question remaining is how to
insert the pseudo-section headers into \thebibliography environment.

	Simply pasting it as a separate paragraph doesn't work. Using \item
results in the line with the pseudo-header being numbered, which is
definitely not what I want. The [label] option for \item I saw mentioned
somewhere doesn't seem to work within \thebibliography.
	Is there any reasonable way to squeeze them in?

Yes, it's possible.  I have an example somewhere on my system but I'm
not able to find it again.

Try this: 

\def\process#1 {\message{^^J#1}\par}
\everypar{\setbox0\lastbox\process}

Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to provide a solution but you
are much more familiar with tex then me, anyway.

  Reinhard

This is interesting, but I don't see how this solves the OP's problem.
AFAICS, this code makes subsequent words go to the console/log,
instead of being typeset.  I can't imagine how this can be applied to
passing arguments.  Probably it's just my poor imagination/eyesight :).

Buried deep inside a lot of other code I have

  \vspace{3ex plus1ex minus1ex}
  \leftline{\normalsize\bfseries\@nameuse{pubhead\@nampublevel}}%
  \nopagebreak[4]
  \vspace{1ex plus1ex}

Which is activated by having BibTeX add an extra argument to its output and
use a command like \mybibitem.  The extra argument is numeric and ordered so
that each subgroup of biblio items has the same number and from group to
group it increases and is saved as \@newpublevel. When the number is equal
to that of the previous item (saved as \curpublevel), \mybibitem behaves
just like \bibitem; when the value changes, the above code is run, where
\@nameuse{pubhead\@newpublevel} outputs the required bibliography
subheading.

It is admittedly hacky, but it does what I want.

Cheers,  Phil

	I can't in good faith redefine \bibitem yet again, I've got packages
depending on it... When I read deeper into the docs, I wrote
\item[]{\large\bf whatever} and it worked just fine, the resulting
strings are not numbered and look more or less like subheadings would.
The only thing that still irks me is that the left edge of such
subheading begins with the list contents and not with the list
numbering, as well as the fact that I don't know whether it's possible
to inherit \section heading style somehow without invoking \section itself.

the ams author faq
  http://www.ams.org/authors/author-faq.html
has a question
  How can I add some explanatory text between
  entries in my bibliography?
the code that is suggested there should work
for you, with perhaps some adjustments to the
vertical spacing.

although the ams author faq has been created
with a bias toward ams publications using the
ams-latex document classes, there are many
questions and answers of interest to all authors.

Aha, but I didn't redefine \bibitem itself, rather I defined something else
that reduces to the plain LaTeX \bibitem, except when a jump from one
section to another occurs, in which case it adds my insertion.

Anyway, you could still simply use the insertion I suggested in place of
your \item[]{\large\bf whatever}, which should sort out the left-hand
alignment problem.  Or am I missing something.

Cheers,  Phil

That's what would be termed a typographer's, em or ``case'' fraction  
(in hot metal typesetting it would've been a single sort pulled from  
a composing case), also called a diagonal fraction --- the former and  
last would probably be the best terms.

The other way would be termed a mathematician's or horizontal, or  
vertical or en/nut (when it occupies an en space) fraction.

Further confusing the issue is the matter of ``built-up'' or  
``piece'' fractions which would have been built up of individual  
pieces and could come in either form.

Donald Knuth discusses this in an article on composing a cook booklet  
which was reprinted in _Digital Typography_ from:

http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb06-1/tb11knut.pdf

and even provides a (Plain) TeX macro for this.

Certain fonts will provide diagonal fractions, e.g.:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{mathptmx}
\usepackage{textcomp}

\begin{document}

\textonehalf

$\frac{1}{2}$

\end{document}

And there's a package called ``nicefrac'' which sort of does this  
(the diagonal isn't angled enough to my mind in most fonts). This is  
mentioned in the Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol list:

a4.pdf

There is also 'xfrac' which gives more options on choosing font for

Hello Svetlana,

Please try this url:
http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/win32/protext/ProTeXt-2.0.exe

Hope it works.  I can't say why the other things you tried failed.
I've never heard of VTS_01_1.VOB -- sounds like a clearcase file of all
things, which is entirely unrelated to any TeX download.

Best regards,
Karl

Subject: [texhax] Whither access to PK fonts?
Message-ID: <000701c7c404$c6d2b740$6401a8c0@D25XBZB1>


I understand the current usage of Type I fonts and True Type fonts and 
realize they are a great step forward.

However, over the past twenty years of using Plain TeX and Metafont, I have 
generated a number of glyphs (some with shading) and symbols as PK fonts 
which I use in my work.  The problem is, I can't find how to access them 
with the newer TeX engines.

Finally, after upgrading my computer and including a very large capacity 
hard drive, I installed TeXLive 2007.  I may not be looking in the right 
places, but nowhere have I been able to find what sort of paths are needed 
(let alone how to specify them) to access PK fonts and their various 
magnifications. This is true for MiKTeX and an upgraded commercial TeX 
engine I've been using. PK fonts are not even mentioned in any of the Help 
files I've looked at.

Metafont was designed to be used in conjunction with TeX.  True, the current 
trend in fonts was not anticipated, but it does seem to me that the current 
engines should be backward compatible with the what the Grand Wizard 
originally implemented and gave to us all to use.

Again, I may have overlooked the obvious and, if so, I hope someone will 
enlighten me and point me in the right direction.

Thank you,
Rex Shudde

pdfpages is a nice thing, but it is sometimes annoying that you have
to write a .tex file whenever you need it.

It is often more convenient to be able to pass the arguments to
\includepdf on the command line.

The following script allows you to pass command-line arguments to TeX.

You can say:

    pdflatex pdfselect '[pages={3,5}]{my_pdf_file}' 

_____ pdfselect.tex ____________________
\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\pagestyle{empty}
\DeclareGraphicsRule{.PDF}{pdf}{.PDF}{}
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.PDF}
\def\doit#1 {\begin{document}%
\includepdf#1
\end{document}}
\everypar{\setbox0\lastbox\doit}

Ok, I see what you mean.  But this is a rather specialized
application, I don't think it's possible to generalize it so that
pdfselect.tex could continue in the usual manner after obtaining the
command line arguments.  This is what actually happens:

tex concatenates non-option arguments into one line, with spaces
between the arguments, and uses that as the first input line.  If the
first line begins with `&', tex takes what follows as the name of a
format file to load; after this, if what remains doesn't begin with
`\', tex inserts \input.  (In reality this is a little trickier, see
`man 1 tex'.)

Thus the call

  $ pdflatex pdfselect '[pages={3,5}]{my_pdf_file}'

is equivalent to

  $ pdflatex 'pdfselect\relax [pages={3,5}]{my_pdf_file}'

(\relax prevents the whole argument being treated as a filename -- for
some reason, it is required on the command line, but not when you
_enter_ the commands at the tex prompt), which is equivalent to

  $ pdflatex '\input pdfselect [pages={3,5}]{my_pdf_file}'

So, basically you don't get anything with several arguments that you
didn't have with one argument (maybe ease of use in some cases).

But thanks for the nice \everypar trick.

Best,
Oleg

Message-ID: <200707122315.l6CNFfB27698@f7.net>

Hi Rex,

I am sure that PK fonts can still work with MiKTeX, even if
documentation is lacking.  All the support is still there in the basic
drivers like dvips, and there are still fonts available only as mf.
(For commercial "upgraded" TeX's, no idea.)

As for what paths and such, I've never used MiKTeX.  However, in TeX
Live, it's the PKFONTS path/environment variable, and I bet it is the
same in MiKTeX.  And the current directory is searched by default.
Nothing has changed in relation to this stuff for decades ...

Maybe if you post the actual command you're running and error you're
getting, more clues would be possible.  Or maybe writing to the miktex
list.

Hope it helps,
Karl

(/input{<file>} does work (I guess it does not need a  file.aux file)).

What am I doing wrong?

Hi,

Please have a look at TeXFAQ to see what \include command does:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=include

Also, as suggested by a poster in the following forum, if you are
using Linux/Unix systems, you can use symbolic links . But another
poster had mentioned that he/she does not have any problems \including
files from different directories:

Thanks greatly.
Using symbolic links works perfectly for me (using linux), whereas putting 
in the file pathname does not.
I am surprised that none of the primary books (by Lamport, Gratzer, or 
The Latex Companion) mentions this problem (or its solution), as far I can 
tell.

Now I will see if this also works with TeX-Live on the Mac :-)
Thanks again,

	Thanks, it did, after much tweaking. However, I ran into another
problem that further confuses the issue.

	The local tradition and requirements involve putting the entire
citation into a footnote AND having it in the aforementioned sectioned
list at the end.
	My script parses the .bbl generated by BibTeX, sorts it, and inserts
those virtual section headings into the right places.
	However, I'm using the bibentry package (from the depths of natbib) to
put citations into footnotes. (nothing else did it right) It does this
through some code that I can't properly understand -- from what I see,
it redefines \thebibliography, redefines the \bibitem command within
that, and sucks all the citations up into variables, which later end up
in footnotes when invoked with the appropriate key.
	Since it has to do that before any citations appear in the document, I
call it with the provided \nobibliography* command. Without virtual
section headings, this command produces no output.
	This is not the case when the .bbl file contains virtual section
headings, since they don't get caught by the redefined commands, so they
come out wherever \nobibliography* was called, and since I also have to
print \bibliograpy normally, they show up where they aren't wanted.
Since the goal is to get a good pdf file fit for distribution, I can't
settle them on a page I could later just remove.
	I don't really understand the code, so I'm not sure if I can make it
handle anything beyond \bibitem, and more importantly, the moment the
virtual section heading needs to be changed, it'll probably break.
	After much googling and shotgun debugging I decided that the only way
to do it is to somehow invoke the \nobibliography command for it's side
effects only, completely discarding whatever paragraphs it might
generate by wrapping it in something -- and just printing it in white or
outside the page boundary won't do either...
	Is there a way to do that?

Wayne,

Are you using \includeonly in the preamble?

For example in my dissertation I have:
(in preamble)
\includeonly{%
frontmatter/nomenclature,
chapters/intro,
chapters/preface,
... ,
images/tex/diagTST,
}

then
\begin{document}
\include{chapters/intro}
....

blah

works fine.

Put \label *after* \caption. If this is not the problem you can 
try pinpointing the problem by creating a minimal example code 
that creates similar problems.

I tried looking in the places I know about, especially the FAQ, but came up
empty -- probably because I don't know how to find it.

What's the easiest way to use single Cyrillic characters (e.g., "sha" for the
Shafarevich-Tate group) as operator-like entities in math mode in LaTeX?

I'm not entirely sure this is what you want, but I dredged this up  
somewhere in the InterWeb:

\usepackage[mathscr]{eucal}
...
\CYRSH.

There may be a better answer out there (note: not valid in math mode).

Subject: [texhax] Simple line numbering for tabular environments
Message-ID: <000001c7c975$fdfd6ff0$4001a8c0@biggus>

Hey all,

I have tried to create an enviroment for my more abstract code listings,
the ones that require assertions and maths bits. Here is what I have so
far:

\begin{tabular*}{\linewidth}
{l>{$}l<{$}>{$}l<{$}}
\hline\\
1&\mathsf{process\_file}(*f:file)\{\\
2&\quad l:string\\
3&\quad l=\mathsf{read\_line}(f)\\
4&\quad\mathsf{while}(l\neq\epsilon))\{\\
5&\quad\quad l=\mathsf{read\_line}(f)\\
6&\quad\}\\
7&\}\\
\\
\hline
\end{tabular*}

I'm almost happy with this. I need the maths environment, for a start,
so I can't use any packages that offer line numbering but take away the
maths formatting. I have found, however, that constantly renumbering the
lines when I change the listings becomes tiresome, so can I automate
this process. I'd like to keep the tabular* environment if at all
possible. I've had a look at the lineno package, amognst others, but
find them daunting. Can anyone get me started? I don't need to wrap
these environments over more than one page or anything like that.

Kind regards,

James

You can replace line numbers by a macro which uses a count register
and increases the value of the count register by one whenever it is
called.

Related LaTeX commands are \newcounter and \addtocounter.

However, obviously you are a programmer.  Isn't it easier to write a
little program which converts the code to something which can be read
by TeX?  Almost everything can be done in TeX/LaTeX but sometimes you
can save a lot of time with a little program written in your favorite
programming language which does the conversion.

You can include LaTeX code with \input{somefile.tex}.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I use the letter sha for other needs.  I see in my files the 
definitions \font\cyr wncyr10 and \newcommand{\sha}{{\cyr sh}\xspace}
which behave well (need protection from math mode though),

Krishnan that's perfect, thanks muchly.

Reinhard, unfortunately this isn't ``real'' code, even pseudo-code. I
must often mix maths with it and must laboriously typeset most it all by
hand.

That's where I looked, and there's no way I could have gotten this (from your
first reply)

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage[OT2,T1]{fontenc}
  \DeclareSymbolFont{cyrletters}{OT2}{wncyr}{m}{n}
  \DeclareMathSymbol{\Sha}{\mathalpha}{cyrletters}{"58}
  \begin{document}
  This is the Tate-Shafarevich group:  $\Sha_{E/K}$.
  Here it is as a subscript:  $A_\Sha$.
  \end{document}

from that. Thanks also for the first one that I can understand.

Thanks also to Justin Walker and Micha Hofri for their responses.

Subject: [texhax] Problem with BaKoMa TrueType cmaps
Message-ID: <DB873318D1A41648BEAC4B5AAB63B3E113F73EF0@MESSAGE-AH.ad.mathworks.com>

Hello All,

I am debugging some "Why do I get the wrong glyph?" bugs in our TeX/LaTeX 
system, and have traced one issue down to the following:

When the Knuth TeX engine creates the DVI file from my TEX file, the DVI 
file refers to character 0x14 with the font cmsy10.  When I check the cmsy10 
glyph table with TeXLive, I notice that character 0x14 is the "less than or 
equal" symbol, which is exactly what I want.  Because of OS problems with 
characters 0x00 to 0x1F, third-party font implementations usually place 
these characters after 0x7F in the character map, and DVI parsers should 
know about these offsets and can retrieve the correct glyphs.

When I ran ttfdump on the BaKoMa version of cmsy10.ttf, I found some 
interesting info regarding the 3.1 subtable.  Here is an excerpt:

Subtable  2.   Platform ID:   3
               Specific ID:   1
               'cmap' Offset: 0x0000011A
       ->Format: 4 : Segment mapping to delta values
  Length:  316
  Version: 0
  segCount: 4  (X2 = 8)
  searchRange: 8
  entrySelector: 2
  rangeShift: 0
  Seg   1 : St = 0020, En = 007E, Delta =    0, RangeOff =     8
  Seg   2 : St = 00A0, En = 00C4, Delta =    0, RangeOff =   196
  Seg   3 : St = 2219, En = 2219, Delta =    0, RangeOff =   268
  Seg   4 : St = FFFF, En = FFFF, Delta =    0, RangeOff =   268

It turns out that while many of the Knuth characters 0x00 to 0x1F have been 
shifted to Segment 2 beginning at 0xA0, Knuth character 0x14 has been moved 
to segment 3 and is at offset 0x2219.

Here are my questions:

1) Why is the "less than or equal" symbol moved to offset 0x2219?
2) Is there a way I could determine that I should use offset 0x2219 for that 
symbol without parsing the list of characters in the cmap to find the right 
one, i.e., is there something special about character 0x14 and offset 
0x2219?  What do I do in my DVI parser when I encounter Knuth character 
0x14?  Is there some algorithm in the TrueType spec that I may have missed?
3) Do other third-party TrueType implementations of cmsy10.ttf use the same 
offsets for the Knuth characters from 0x00 to 0x1F?
4) If the implementations are all fundamentally different, should I 
incorporate DVI parsers written by the authors of these TrueType 
implementions?  Must all such third-party parsers follow some accepted API?

Thanks in advance!

I have used Latex for 22 years.

My current implementation is TLC2 TEX CD, which I got on CD in book 
by Mittelbach and Goosens on Addison-Wesley.

I use Emacs for entering text.

Here is my problem:

1.  I had to get a new PC, and got one with Windows Vista.

2.  I installed the TEX program and Emacs

3.  When I open Emacs and try to process a Latex file, using 
PDFLatex, I get error message, that I cannot use PDFLatex in Batch mode.

4.  Other than that everything looks fine.

Any suggestions for how I can get LATEX to work with Windows Vista?

Thank you.

BTW: the TLC2 CD is quite old, you might consider installing a newer

Hi Brian,

(Sorry for the delayed reply.)

    1) Why is the "less than or equal" symbol moved to offset 0x2219?

I can only suggest asking the bakoma author.  Personally, I am quite
surprised to learn that any characters have been moved.  My guess is
that it is bakoma-specific and the bakoma author wrote his drivers and
fonts to match.

I know of no standards regarding such changing of characters.

I'm not sure what environment you need your DVI reader to run in, but
note that cmsy10.ttf is specifically part of bakoma, not part of TeX
Live or (I believe) MiKTeX.  Indeed, there are no widely available
truetype versions of cmsy10.ttf that I know of.  (The Type1 cmsy10.pfb
is used widely, of course.)

Hope this helps somehow.

Best,
Karl

Subject: [texhax] OT: explaining the problems with long term storage of data
 in proprietary formats
Message-ID: <46A4FBA1.2000706@binghamton.edu>

I apologize for the OT question, but I can't resist tapping the
knowledge of this group, who by definition tend to have a deeper
understanding of open-source software issues.  Further correspondence
could be off-list if preferred.

At the medical school where I work, we are about to take up the topic of
tracking students' experiences:  how many of what kind of patients they
see during their four years in school.  This is a new regulatory
requirement from our accrediting body.  I'm a member of a small working
group looking at strategies and options.  Most would involve some sort
of electronic database, of course.

There are many new companies that are offering web-based
products/services to do the tracking. Students enter info (age, sex,
diagnosis, etc.) and it is all transmitted to the company's servers.
The companies offer periodic reports back to students and faculty.
There are varying amounts of eye-candy and features to differentiate one
product from another, all trying to get market share.

I know little about these companies so far. Specifically, I don't know
in what format they store the data.  (I suppose SQL would be a good
bet.)  But one of the concepts to which I want to introduce the
subcommittee is the idea of storage of digital data, file formats,
long-term usability of data, and ease of migration to other solutions.
In essence, I want to make sure that if a vendor we choose goes belly
up, that we can still have our data.

These issues are completely foreign to the other members of the
committee.  Very bright people, but that does not mean they have a
sophisticated understanding of computer information systems, and even
less so of open-source philosophies.

Can anyone point me to on-line resources that explain, in *very* simple
terms, the problems of storing data in proprietary, non-open, file
formats?  It would at least get them started thinking about the issue.

Thanks.

A couple of years ago I held a short seminar at Sant'Anna
School of Advanced Studies in Pisa whose title was just
"How file formats can be used to favour
(or hamper) innovation and really free markets"

If I understand correctly your request, it's almost made to order
for your needs. You can download the PDF slides in English from

http://old.opendocumentfellowship.org/Resources/Articles

and read a report of the seminar, including comments from
Prof. Bottazzi on what he defined "indeed a huge problem and
expense, whose true magnitude is still barely understood" at

http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8727

Any feedback is welcome. Please let me know how things go, I'm
always interested in studying these issues and writing more articles
about them. Just one note: please send any off list replies directly
to marco, at digifreedom.net

I often use ${\bar x}$ and ${\bar \xi}$; however if these symbols are
near the bars which are on the different heights do not look
aesthetically right. I can use   ${\bar {\matstrut x}}$ and ${\bar

Surely, the same story with \hat, \tilde etc and with any letters of

I think only the first variant looks "right." If you have an x\xi and want
bars, hats, etc. on both, you may want to see if bar, hat, etc., commutes with
multiplication. If so, then something like \widebar{\xi} might be what you
really want.

Disclaimer: I've used \widetilde and \widehat, so I assume such variants are
available in some package(s) for \bar, etc.

No, ``bars'' are individual in my case and should not be placed over
more than one letter

For \bar the equivalent of \widexxx is \overline.

Not quite: \overline is thicker than \bar.

Subject: [texhax] A non-interfering \ifmodulo macro in TeX
Message-ID: <20070726043830.GC20272@zenon.in.qult.net>

Hi texhaxers!

I have been lastly playing around with the macro expansion mechanisms in plain
TeX and have come with an interesting solution.

I wanted to write a macro to compute a modulo.  Of course, the best would have
been to be able to use it like this

  \count0=\modulo{\n}{\m}

and then use \count0 or whatever counter that has received the result of the
computation.  Unfortunately, plain TeX does not allow such things, simply
because all macro expansion happens before any assignment (or something like
that).  After some searching on the web (and in texhax's archives), I learned
that it is probably almost that easy to do using e-TeX new functionalities.

But still, I wanted to try as hard as I could to do it in plain TeX.

A possible approach, if one forgets about assigning the result to a counter,
is to define an \ifmodulo macro that would have to be used in the following
way

  \ifmodulo{\n}{\m}{\p}{code for true case}{code for false case}      ,

with the semantics being that the true case gets expanded if \n mod \m equals
\p, otherwise the false case is expanded.  A quick and dirty implementation is
then

  \def\ifmodulo#1#2#3#4#5{%
    \begingroup\count0=#1\divide\count0by#2\multiply\count0by#2
    \multiply\count0by-1\count1=#1\advance\count1by\count0
    \expandafter\endgroup\expandafter\ifnum\the\count1=#3 #4\else #5\fi
  }

the \begingroup and \endgroup protecting the environment from interference of
the use of \count0 and \count1.

Although the syntax of such a macro is nice, it is lacking the power of
classical \if* of plain TeX.  The idea would be to have an \ifmodulo macro
that would be usable in the following way

  \ifmodulo \n by \m < \p ... \else ... \fi    , or
  \ifmodulo \n by \m = \p ... \else ... \fi    , or even
  \ifmodulo \count12 by \count34 > 304 ... \fi

The idea is to have the macro capture the first and second operand and compute
the result that is then fed to \ifnum, along with all the following tokens, so
that the whole construct could be used just as a primitive conditional.  The
main problem I encountered is that unlike the first operand that is delimited
by the "by" characters, the second operand is not delimited by anything known
in advance.  Thus, the macro has to be able to parse a variable length second
argument, accepting tokens following the first one, as long as they are
contiguous digits (not separated by space).  By chance, it happens that in the
case counters like \count123 are used, the rule is the same: get the first
token and all following contiguous digits.

So here comes my code.

  \catcode`@=11
  \def\ifmodulo#1by#2{%
    \begingroup
    \def\parsesign##1{%
      \def\\{\let\stoken= } \\ %
      \ifx-\token\def\next{\parsesignget{##1}}%
      \else\ifx+\token\def\next{\parsesignget{##1}}%
      \else\ifx\stoken\token
        \def\next{\def\p{\parsesignget{##1}{}}\afterassignment\p\let\token= }%
      \else\def\next{\parsefirstget{##1}}\fi\fi\fi\next}%
    \def\parsefirstget##1##2{\def\p{\parsenum{##1##2}{}}\futurelet\token\p}%
    \def\parsesignget##1##2{\def\p{\parsesign{##1##2}}\futurelet\token\p}%
    \def\parsenum##1##2{%
      \ifx0\token\def\next{\parsenumget{##1}{##2}}%
      \else\ifx1\token\def\next{\parsenumget{##1}{##2}}%
      \else\ifx2\token\def\next{\parsenumget{##1}{##2}}%

      \else\ifx5\token\def\next{\parsenumget{##1}{##2}}%
      \else\ifx6\token\def\next{\parsenumget{##1}{##2}}%
      \else\ifx7\token\def\next{\parsenumget{##1}{##2}}%
      \else\ifx8\token\def\next{\parsenumget{##1}{##2}}%
      \else\ifx9\token\def\next{\parsenumget{##1}{##2}}%
      \else\def\next{\endgroup\begingroup
        \advance\count10by\@ne \ch at ck 0\insc at unt\count
        \allocationnumber=\count10\countdef\firstarg=\allocationnumber
        \advance\count10by\@ne \ch at ck 0\insc at unt\count
        \allocationnumber=\count10\countdef\secondarg=\allocationnumber
        \firstarg=\number#1
        \secondarg=\number##1##2
        \def\cond{\csname ifnum\endcsname}%
        \count0=\firstarg\divide\firstarg by\secondarg
        \multiply\firstarg by-\secondarg\advance\count0by\firstarg
        \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\endgroup\expandafter\cond\the\count0 }%
      \fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\next}%
    \def\parsenumget##1##2##3{\def\p{\parsenum{##1}{##2##3}}\futurelet\token\p}%
    \let\token #2\parsesign{}#2}%
  \catcode`@=10


To clarify, the \parse*get macros are the ones extracting the tokens for the
corresponding \parse* macros.  \parsesign basically extracts all leading + or
- signs and skips spaces until anything not a sign nor a space is read.  Then
\parsefirstget extracts the first such token and calls parsenum, which
basically extracts all the following digits, while keeping in its first
argument, the signs and the first non-space-non-sign token.  Lastly, the \next
macro defined after the last \else of \parsenum does the actual computation,
by allocating two new counters (using an expanded inner \newcount).
Strangely, I had to use the \ifnum indirectly, to avoid it gobbling a \fi.

It works like a charm as far as I tested it.  The only flaw is that if you
have for example

  \newcount\foo
  \foo=123
  \ifmodulo\foo456 by 2 = 0 ...

then \foo456 is accepted and eventually expanded as 123456, which is not what
happens with an \ifnum.  I just don't know how to determine that some token is
in fact a \countdef (or a \dimendef, \skipdef, \toksdef, etc).

What do you think?  Do you have any simpler way of doing it?  

Cheers. =)

In the /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf file, there is a variable that controls
whether you can write to a file (i.e. the aux file) that is not in your
current working directory.

The default setting (on my system) is as follows: openout_any = p
This indicates that you cannot go to parent directories and other
restrictions.

Change this to: openout_any = a
This will allow you to open any file.  You may also want to look at the
'r' option and see if that suits your purpose.

Hello,

I am new to Latex and I may bother you with stupid questions. I  
immediately apologize for that.

I am a mac user, not much familiar with unix commands... I am working  
on a macbook pro, intel core duo.
I downloaded the mactex package and started to install.
I am asked to use the i-installer that I installed on my computer  
beforehand. It seems to work correctly.
Launching i-installer (latest release), I am told that I should see  
in the i-packages box an i-package whose
name is Tex and whose URL is http://tug.org/i-packages/tex.ii2   (see  
http://chamblandes.tuxfamily.org/LaTeXMacOSX/latexmacosx3.html)
I should then open and configure.

Well, the point is that in the right-hand side box, no i-package with  
a name starting with Tex appears. I am blocked.
On the left-hand side box (directories) I am using Gerben's i- 
Directory at TUG. I tried with the other directories. No better result.

Could you please give me a hand ?
Is there another way to proceed ?

It s a bit of a panic since I have to urgently finish off courses for  
next september.

Thank you for your help and concern. Kind regards,

Michel



PS : (yesterday I tryed to install Texmaker for which I had to  
install Tex using i-install - Neither could i-install see the tex.ii2  
i-package)

I'm really surprised ---the MacTeX

http://www.tug.org/mactex/

installer should not ask you to use i-Installer, which is an  
application to install another distribution, gwTeX, a sister distro  
to MacTeX, and which can coexist with MacTeX

http://www.tug.org/mactex/whatgetsinstalledwhere.html#multiple

but is not MacTeX nor is needed to run MacTeX.

That page is old.

Now is called ``gwTeX based on TeX Live''.

But I insist that you don't need to install gwTeX ---it's a parallel  
distribution, not part of MacTeX. Please read the instructions in  
http://www.tug.org/mactex/ again.

You can also subscribe to the TeX on Mac OS X mailing list:

The instructions you are using are a little bit old, so the name has  
changed. What you want is now called

gwTeX based on TeX Live (url: http://tug.org/i-packages/texlive.ii2).

(Don't use the "Configure Only" option like the instructions you  
mentioned say, since you actually want to install at this point.)

Subject: [texhax] wrapfig and subsection headers?
Message-ID: <98DE5CEC-404E-45EF-973E-1A4684DEA50D@mac.com>

I hate to bother the group with what is probably a FAQ, but I can't
seem to figure out the right query with which to google up an answer.

I'm trying to wrapfig some figures, currently using wrapfig 3.6.

In some cases these are obliged to wrap subsection* headings.
The behavior that I'm seeing is that if one does, thereafter, _all_
subsection* or subsection headings are wrapped to the same
(shortened) width, as are the first n lines of all subsequent
paragraphs.

If I replace the subsection* with, ie \textbf, everything
works fine.  If I force the wrapfig to not overlap the subsection*
heading, everything works fine, or at least more as expected.

If I call a zero-width wrapfig after the end of the paragraph that
_should_ be wrapped, everything pops back into proper alignment.
This would almost be an acceptable hack, except in places where
I have the wrapfig running beside a series of shorter paragraphs,
where I'd have to pick the right line-break internal to the right
paragraph to "unwrap" at (because all shorter paragraphs, being
less than the wrapping height of the wrapfig, now all wrap, even
when they're not beside the wrapfig.

Manual placement, or floated placement does not seem to affect
the outcome.

Any pointers to either what I'm doing wrong, or where I can find
a workable solution, would be most appreciated.

Will,

Not exactly the help you might be looking for, but you might try picins
instead of wrapfig. I append a previous posting of mine, though, that
shows similar problems with figures and list environments (which wrapfig
doesn't do at all, and which is why I use picins). Perhaps it will
behave better with sectioning though. I've tried to chase the authors of
picins, but they are no longer reachable. 

My use of this kind of thing suggests it is an area where a real texpert
is needed to improve on Latex's handling of figures. On my wish list
are:

* a modern equivalent to picins

* a version of multicol that can handle floats

Regards,
Steve

Subject: picins bug
Date: Sat, 18 Feb 2006 17:07:08 +0000
I am using the picins package to flow text around a figure. It has the
advantage over others (wrapfig and floatflt) that it works within list
environments. However, the attached example shows that it does not
properly restore the list indentation if used in only one of the list
items. The one following the picins is ok, but the 2nd and subsequent
after that is incorrect. In two-column mode, even the 2nd item doesn't 
get indented properly.

I have a workaroud, which is to put a blank \parpic at the end of each
following item. That adds a bit of vertical space but is otherwise ok.
Another workaround would be welcome.

It would seem that the author of this package is not traceable, and the
code too dense for me to figure out what is going wrong. Has someone
else hit/solved this? It's an old (latex209?) package; version 3.0.

Cheers,
Steve

--------------------

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx,picins}

\newcommand{\longtext}{Here is some long long text. Here is some long
text. Here is some long text. Here is some long text. Here is some long
text. Here is some long text. Here is some long text. Here is some long
text. Here is some long text. Here is some long text.}

%\twocolumn
\sloppy

\begin{document}

This demonstrates an apparent bug in picins in connection with a
list-making environment. The first example illustrates the bug.

\begin{itemize}

\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}
\parpic[rf]{\begin{picture}(10,30)\put(0,4){HELP}\end{picture}}

\item{}  \longtext
\item{}  \longtext
\item{}  \longtext
\item{}  \longtext
\item{}  \longtext

\end{itemize}

Note the incorrect indentation in the 3rd item, which is apparently
related to something parpic does that doesn't affect the 2nd. The next
example has a parpic in each item, and works ok.

\begin{enumerate}

\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}

\item{} \parpic[rf]{\begin{picture}(10,10)\put(0,4){HELP}\end{picture}}
\longtext

\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}  % this seems to need to be re-set each
time

\item{} \parpic[rf]{\begin{picture}(10,10)\put(0,4){HELP}\end{picture}}
\longtext

\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}

\item{} \parpic[rf]{\begin{picture}(10,10)\put(0,4){HELP}\end{picture}}
\longtext

\end{enumerate}

End of test.

Subject: [texhax] Strange behaviour of size of parenthesis using lmodern
Message-ID: <46ACD1C3.80508@laposte.net>

For some strange reason, the parenthesis around R^4 are bigger than
those of the other expression (which apparently retain their smallest
size) in this code fragment:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}


\begin{document}
$\dim\left(R^{2\times 3}\right) \ne \dim\left(R^4\right)$
\end{document}

Actually \dim is not necessary to cause the problem, but just to
illustrate the kind of situation in which something like that would be
used. Also, \left( and \right) are used because in my document I have a
macro that typesets \dim( ) around its argument (which could potentially
be higher than a line).

This strange behaviour does not happen in 10pt font size, only in 11pt
and 12pt. Also, if the lmodern package is not used, both sets of
parenthesis have the same size (the smallest one).

Does anyone have any idea of the reason for that?

OK, I see it.  It requires \subsection immediately after the
wrapfig.  It is that "local group" bugaboo again -- if the 
wrapping starts in a local group, it doesn't end properly.
I hope I get a chance to work on it soon.

However, if you use "{Test}" it will fail,

> heading, everything works fine, or at least more as expected.

It can overlap, but not with the section first.  (I thought
sections used to work as the first-wrapped material, whereas 
lists did not.)

As a work-around for now, you should be able to do:

\begin....
\end{wrapfigure}
\noindent\vspace{-????}
\subsection*{...}

The amount of vspace should be \baselineskip plus whatever 
space is put before section titles.

The numbers in the scriptfont have different heights. They are

0: 5.1555pt
1: 5.1555pt
2: 5.1555pt
3: 5.1555pt

Dear TeXperts & TeXnicians,

XyMTeX is a macro package for TeX, written by Fujita Shinsaku for
rendering high quality chemical structures:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XyMTeX

Although it is well documented and drawing simple chemical structures
is easy (for example \bzdrh{4==OH gives the structure for phenol), it
would be convenient if there exists a repository for complex chemical
structures such as steroids, secondary metabolites of plants etc.
Moreover, a group dedicated to XyMTeX will further aid in highlighting
chemical structure typesetting and will serve as a platform for
discussion and troubleshooting.

Therefore, I request those that are interested, to subscribe to the
LaTeX-XyMTeX google groups and provide their expertise.

In CMR the numbers are not strictly inside the bounding box and the same  
is the case in LM - except for 4 and 7 where the bounding box has been  
extended so that the character is contained in the top (but not the bottom  
for 7).

Running this example with and then without lmodern shows it quite clearly:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\begin{document}
\setlength\fboxsep{0pt}\setlength\fboxrule{1sp}
\fbox{$\scriptstyle 2$}\fbox{$\scriptstyle 4$}
\fbox{$\scriptstyle 6$}\fbox{$\scriptstyle 7$}
\end{document}

Quick tests show that for many of the fonts in LM, figures have different  
heights. In sans serif for example, 4,5 and 7 are smaller than the rest  
and for bold math only 7 is bigger than the rest.

I would certainly be a little perplexed finding I would get different  
sized fences depending on whether I was talking about R^3 or R^4 and its  
the kind of thing which would prevent me from using it in production.

I also believe that's a bug. After all, in Computer Modern the heights 
are made in a way that the brackets have the same size, and Latin Modern 
is aimed at being compatible with CM, as far as I understand.

Moreover, even if that were a totally different font, the point raised 
by Morten was exactly what happened in my text when I saw the strange 
behaviour: I was saying that dim(R^{2x3}) is different from dim(R^4), 
and saw the different sizes.

Greetings,

I would like to process some of my early *.tex files.
For the tables in those files I need 2 procedures
for input:

tables 
tableins.hdr

Instead of rewiting the table sections, I would very
much like to obtain a copy of these programs.

My last installed system is: Y&Y TeX System [2001]

I would appreciate very much if you could help me.

Have a great day,

does latex or tex have a 'continue to next line' control sequence? 
something like \ in gnuplot?

e.g., i have some really long lines in table, (modulo your email program's 
word-wrap):

&\%something$\to$&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{5\%}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{10\%}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{13\%}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{14\%}

i'd like to make it something like :

&\%something$\to$&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{5\%} CONTINUE-TO-NEXT-LINE 
&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{10\%}&\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{13\%}&\multicolumn{something}

so its easier in emacs.

Subject: [texhax] whitespace before \end{figure} command
Message-ID: <46AE0BD2.90104@ametsoc.org>

I'm getting errors if I have any whitespace before the \end{figure} 
command in my captions.  I'm wondering if this is normal behavior and 
there should never be whitespace before a command like this, or if it is 
an indication of some other problem?

The following works ok:
\begin{figure}
  \noindent\includegraphics[width=40pc,angle=0]{./figures/figure01.eps}
  \caption{Enter the caption for your figure here.  Repeat as
  necessary for each of your figures. Create a figures directory and
  place all figures in that directory.}\label{f1}
\end{figure}

but space added before the "\end{figure} command result in errors:
\begin{figure}
  \noindent\includegraphics[width=40pc,angle=0]{./figures/figure01.eps}
  \caption{Enter the caption for your figure here.  Repeat as
  necessary for each of your figures. Create a figures directory and
  place all figures in that directory.}\label{f1}
    \end{figure}

The errors given are a bit unclear to me:
! Fle ended while scanning use of \next
<inserted text>
    \par
!Emergency stop

In the second case, any reference to figure 1 just appears as question 
marks.

Any insight you can provide would be helpful; hopefully I'm not missing 
something too obvious.

what exactly are you attempting to do?

why do you have \multicolumn on every entry?

do you know about the 'p' column specifier?

End the first piece with "%", then continue on the next line.  Often,  
you don't even need the %.  TeX is very flexible to new lines, a new  
line is often understood a space.  RTFM.

could you please provide a minimal example, this is not normal, so we need 
to know which class you are using, etc.

ah, i was thinking that table/tabular would complain if i did that - i 
didn't realize how flexible it was - thanks!

>  RTFM.

one of my favorite latex sites :

http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/teTeX/latex/latex2e-html/ltx-2.html

says, in section :
http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/teTeX/latex/latex2e-html/ltx-68.html

"Note that \\  must be used to specify the end of each line of the table, 
except the last. (It must be used after the last line if an \hline command 
is used to put a line at the bottom of the table.)"

Lamport, 2nd. ed. has an example in section 3.6.2, p.63 where the \\ is 
replaced with a carriage return, yet it is not mentioned in the text - 
obviously an exercise for the reader -

... this must be manual citation you are referring to - if not, what 
manual are you reading?  where in that manual does it refer to the 
end-of-line in table/tabular environment?

my question was specifically about continuing to the next line in the 
table/tabular environment - where is it specifically written that carriage 
returns apply as usual in latex?

i love learning more about the resources on the internet for latex, a 
major reason to choose latex.  can you please provide your citation?

regards,

I am using the article class, modified with my own style file.  I've 
traced the problem to the following line in my style file:
\usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}%

It appears that if I do not use the endfloat package then I do not get 
any errors. When I do include use of the endfloat package (regardless of 
whether the nomarkers option is specified) and I have spaces before the 
\end{figure} command I get the errors.

"line of the table" refers to lines of the output typeset table, not  
to lines of input code.

OK, I just read the endfloat package file and it indicates:

When floats are being read, LATEX is in verbatim mode. Among other 
things, this
means that the lines like
\end{figure}
must appear on lines by themselves without any whitespace before or 
after them.
A complete reimplementation of the most difficult part of the package is 
required
to fix this limitation, but it is among the distant goals I have.

So I guess this is all "normal" behavior.

As noted, you can finish a line with % and the next line is read as if 
it belonged right after the first one (that is, with no whitespace).

But, in this case, you can just break the line. Whitespace around the 
column separator & is irrelevant.

yeah, thanks - i thought table/tabular would complain, but i just tried it 
and its like usual w/ latex.  as they say, you learn something new 
everyday...

as for my horrendous table code, that's another topic.

being an emacs user, do you know what happens if you issue

M-x align-current

inside a tabular?

That is a vary handy feature

for tables:

learn to use booktabs, array, dcolumn/numprint

colors in tables: colortbl and friends.

if you can get your ahnd on a copy then have a look at the tables in the 
Chicago manual of style, i.e. do not use vertical lines in tables.

Here is a quote from Robert Bringhurst:

Tables are notoriously time-consuming to typeset, but the problems posed 
are often editorial as mush as typographic. If the table is not planned in 
a readable form to begin with, the typographer can render it readable only 
by rewriting or redesigning it from scratch.

Message-ID: <74f506dc0707301234p3b1bcb3cv2822ebf70c2c1857@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I am typesetting a book with a lot of short footnotes that have to be
typeset into paragraph as described in TeXBook, pages 398--400. I am
using the macro in TeXBook, but sometimes the page-breaking is far from
optimal. The reason is that the estimated height of footnotes is sometime
very different from the real height. This can be best described by an
example:

\hsize=100pt, \footBaselineSkip=10pt --> \fudgefactor=.1

Let's have on a page 11 footnotes, each 10pt long. The estimated height is
11pt, while the real height is 20pt (2 lines). The page breaking algorithm
might find a break where 11pt footnote fit perfectly, but 20pt is then too
much. In fact this happens quite often, leading to many overfull boxes
during output routine.

The real problem seem how to make the effective height (ie total height of
current footnotes) to be *always the same* as the final height (ie
totalFootLines*\footBaselineSkip). This is needed to avoid page breaking
from happening too late, as discussed above.

My question is, does anyone know of a trick to deal with the above issue?

I did some searching, and the most relevant thing I found was edmac.doc
from the edmac package. The macros in edmac.doc has some improvements over
the macro in TeXBook, but it doesn't seem to deal witht the above problem.

Thanks,
Thanh

Hi Thanh

Presumably fnpara.sty has the same problem: it is very old and, as the
minimal documentation says: it is only Knuth's algorithm dressed up
for LaTeX.

Do you know exactly why the algorithm gets the number of lines wrong
sometimes (I am not surprised if it does)?  Any information would save time
in fixing it.

Is it only when the footnote contains non-standard-height lines?  That
would be a tricky case to automate ... take Jill's advice `Don't use
non-text footnotes in your books!':-).

This small plain TeX example shows this:

You're right in that. However, Latex does ignore whitespace before the 
&, as this shows:

---8<---
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
a&b
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
a &b
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
a& b
\end{tabular}

\end{document}
---8<---

The result is different because of the automatic column spacing, but all 
three tabular's are equal. And this makes me wonder how exactly can 
Latex achieve that effect?

Thanks Donald.  Much obliged!  I wish I could find the time
to learn the art of programming style and class files, so that
I could assist with more than bug reports.  TeX/LaTeX is one
of the few languages where I seem to remain persistently
and embarrassingly clueless.

It seems LaTeX places a \unskip in the template after cell contents,
which removes preceding glue in horizontal mode.

Dear all,

In books of humanity sciences, it is quite often that some notes are put
at the end of a chapter.
I think that chapterbib can do something similar, but is there other
more genuine way of doing it?

Thanks in advance.

Try \RequirePackage{endnotes} in your preamble, \endnote{...} to
specify the endnotes, \theendnotes where you want the notes placed,
and \setcounter{endnote}{0} to reset the notes counter for the next
chapter.  [Better yet, look at page 125 in The LaTeX Companion 2nd ed.]
