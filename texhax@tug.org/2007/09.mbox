Message-ID: <46D9A2F2.8070701@ukfsn.org>

Hi all,

Does anyone know the latex macro for displaying barbed wire brackets (as 
seen in the paper `Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, 
Envelopes and Barbed Wire)?

I must admit that I'm not very familiar with bananas and lenses.
Maybe I'm a bit more familiar with bananas than with lenses.  I
personally prefer oranges and tomatoes anyway.  Please check first
whether there is something useful in

  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-a4.pdf

If there is no appropriate symbol available, you can probably define
it yourself, see 

  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/doc/generic/pgf/version-for-pdftex/en/pgfmanual.pdf 

Regards,
  Reinhard

I have just installed texlive 7 on a new computer running vista.  I do not

In TeX and LaTeX:

This is a $\backslash$ (backslash).

This is a {\tt\char`\\} (backslash).

In LaTeX, also

This is a \textbackslash{} (backslash).


So, for example,

c:$\backslash$subd1$\backslash$subsubd1

You were right; the route to mf was not in the path (but why didn't the 
installation program do that?).  Now there are new errors:

C:\math>C:\TEXLIV~1\bin\win32\mktexpk.exe --mfmode / --dpi 600 --bdpi 600 
--mag
600/600 cmr6
mktexpk: C:\Users\Michael

//cmr6.600pk already exists.
C:\Users\Michael 
Barr/.texlive2007/texmf-var/fonts//pk/ljfour/public/cm//cmr6.60
0pk

The claim is that the font already exists.  Fine, but it is not being 
found by dviout.  There were repeated errors like that and then the final 
display was blank.  I assume that there are additional environment 
variables to be set, but I thought the lsr file contained all that 
information.  And yes, I did run mktexlsr (having added some addtional 
files, mainly for xypic).

Incidentally, the help files for dviout are useless since they are 
apparently in previous format for, say, XP, and not valid under vista.  
Wonderful!

	Use the package ``float'' and \begin{figure}[H].

Thank you, Rolf, that worked. Now I have another problem, the numbering of the figures is not correct. For example, a figure which shows a figure number 7 below the figure shows up as Fig. 2.1.2 where it is referenced in the text. How can this be fixed?

latex already tries to do what you want.  There are some variables you
might want to change.

  http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/english/epslatex.pdf

explains this in detail.

  Look at section 18 (Customizing Float Placement).

  Reinhard

If your previewer is unable to deal with scalable fonts it makes more
sense to use pdftex and Adobe-Reader instead.

That should work (since tex is working properly, as far as I have tested 
it).  I don't like to go that route however, since you have to exit the 
file in order to recompile and I am accustomed to making small changes and 
recompiling immediately.  However, this is only a travel computer, so...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0709031229290.2780-100000@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

Has anyone gotten tex (and, especially mf) to run correctly under Vista?

As brief as I can make it, here is my experience.  I accepted a full 
installation from the TeXLive 2007 CD (or DVD, I didn't pay attention).  
It seemed to install properly and I got tex working with no problem (I had 
to install xypic and my own diagxy).  When I tired to run the viewer, I 
got mysterious error messages I wrote about previously.  I tried to use a 
suggestion from Reinhard Kotucha to use pdftex.  Instead I tried dvipdfm, 
but I don't think there is any essential difference.  Here is the error 
message I got:

[c:\math\tac]dvipdfm isbell1

isbell1.dvi -> isbell1.pdf
[1kpathsea: Running mktexpk --mfmode / --bdpi 600 --mag 1+0/600 --dpi 600

mktexmf: empty or non-existent rootfile!
mktexpk: don't know how to create bitmap font for xyatip10.kpathsea: 
Appending f
ont creation commands to missfont.log.
xyatip10: Can't locate a Type 1, TTF, PK, or virtual font file

Not sure how to proceed.  For now this is fatal
Maybe in the future, I'll substitute some other font.

Output file removed.

I gave up and copied the entire miktex directory from my old computer 
(there were nearly 600 MB and it took 22 minutes) and tried running it.  
When I ran yap, I got a mysterious message about a missing font. Well, the 
font is there and it is where mf put it running under yap on my old 
computer.  The display seemed to be correct except for missing characters 
from the Zapf chancery fonts, which are in the location
\miktex\localtexmf\fonts\pk\modeless\adobe\zapfchan 
and yap was unable to make them either.  There is an error message from 
yap located somewhere, but well hidden unless you know exactly where to 
look.

Incidentally, AFAIK, TeX works fine; it is only the fonts that are a 
problem.  Since I had copied the directory in toto, it didn't seem 
necessary to run mktexlsr, but I did anyway after the first failure.  My 
old computer has no relevant environment variables (except the path) set 
so that cannot be the problem.

My best guess is that some permissions are not allowed, although that does 
not explain yap's failure to find just one font.

    Try to avoid this. 

Of course, but I was looking for an actual solution.

For the record, it seems resetting catcodes works, at least with pdftex
-- see below.  And with \usepackage{grffile}, you can have spaces too
(with pdftex).  Not that I tried very hard to break it, I'm sure there
are fragilities.

The main annoyance is having to explicitly end the group with the reset
catcodes.  I didn't see any kind of hook to regain control after
\includegraphics does the real work.  Oh well.

    apparently in previous format for, say, XP, and not valid under vista.  

Vista had been out for a couple weeks (if that) when TL 2007 was
released, so it's not exactly surprising that it wasn't possible for
everything to be updated.  (And anyway, we wouldn't want to update
things if the result is incompatible, which is Microsoft's avowed goal,
so nothing comes easy.)

Anyway, as for your real problem, I just don't know why the fonts aren't
being found.  Sorry.

I recollect having had problems like this.  I also vaguely recollect  
that the solution is to put the label ***immediately*** after the

Subject: [texhax] [e]tex -ipc and -ipc-start
Message-ID: <20070904175215.A75A2B4EA3@m5.chicago.il.us>

I'm trying to figure out how to use -ipc and -ipc-start (the ultimate
goal is to invoke tex in a pipeline whose output will be sent to a
printer).  According to the official TeX documention, this is what the
-ipc and -ipc-start options do:


    4.5 IPC and TeX
    ===============

    (Sorry, but I'm not going to write this unless someone actually uses
    this feature. Let me know.)

      This functionality is available only if the `--enable-ipc' option was
    specified to `configure' during installation of Web2c (*note
    Installation::).

      If you define `IPC_DEBUG' before compilation (e.g., with `make
    XCFLAGS=-DIPC_DEBUG'), TeX will print messages to standard error about
    its socket operations.  This may be helpful if you are, well, debugging.


Can you please send me, or direct me to, something more useful than
the above?  Thank you in advance.

This is all ancient stuff.  In the days of the Amiga and the NeXT,
computers were slow enough where sometimes you had to
wait for TeX to finish typesetting your document before you
could view it.  I added some small hooks into TeX so that
information about each page being completed was sent out
a pipe to an external viewer, so you could (for instance) preview
the typeset content of page 49 while TeX continued working
on your 350 page document.

These days TeX will typeset that 350 page document before
your windowing system can even pop a window to the top of
the stack, so this functionality will probably remain in the
dustbin of history.

For your pipe, make TeX write a full dvi file and then just work
from there.  Disk is cheap and it's a much more straightforward
solution.

Readers of my recent posts will know I am stuggling to get TeX working 
properly under Vista.  I have given up on TeXLive2007 and have installed 
MikTeX.  It seems to run properly except that yap runs with the message:
X Not all fonts could be loaded.  See 'File->Document Properties', for 
details.  There is an OK box and a Help box.  I cannot find any file 
called Document Properties.  If you click on help you get a screen that 
says: 

1. Fonts

This page lists all loaded.
If a font could not be 
loaded then it appears 
as >>> Not loadable 
- double-click to 
see details.  You will 
get a detailed problem
description, when you
double-click the entry.

It is not evident what should be double clicked.  It is not evident 
whether this is  a message from the OS or from Yap.  I tried 
double-clicking everything in sight.  The missing fonts (pzc) are there 
and the file seems to display properly except for them.  Another font 
(eufk) is loaded after that since it appears later.  The font is correctly 
pointed to by lsr, so I am at a loss.  The same file can be viewed 
perfectly well on my older computer under XP.  The copy of MikTeX was 
copied verbatim to the new computer.  Can anyone tell me the meaning of 
the message and where to look to get that detailed description?

I'm not sure it's exactly what you need, but it might be a good start:

PyTeX ? Python plus TeX
http://www.pytex.org/

The TeX daemon

Hello,

I'm developing a set of macros to define paragraph styles. Something
like this:

\NewParagraphStyle[space-after=.5cm,font-size=10pt,
        line-height=5mm]{BodyText}
\begin{BodyText}
First paragraph...
\end{BodyText}
\begin{BodyText}
Second paragraph...

I don't expect big problems. The only worry is that I might re-
inventing the wheel. If a package with such functionality already
exists, would you say its name, please?

Thanks in advance!

First time in many years I have a sever size constrains for deeply
structured document

Structure of it should be like one in article with the whole range
from section to subparagraph (but no math, basically it is a very
special grant proposal for financing high- and elementary- schools
math competitions).

amsart is much more economical than article. However if someone has an
article or memoir settings with left aligned section etc headers (like
in article in contrast to center-aligned headers in amsart) and which
is the most compact (occupies the least space) but still look decently
(margins are not too narrow, ...), I would appreciate getting it ASAP
(people I am helping as usual left everything for the last moment)

Thank you

Yes, but some people do mailings &c. which're tens or even hundreds  
of thousands of pages (think address labels) --- being able to start  
the printing before the job is finished spooling can save _lots_ of

Please,

I am trying to pass data to a predefined table, so that I can say

Pseudo code:

\newcommand{\mytable}{

       \mydata[i] & \myotherdata[i]  \\

\newcommand{\mydata[1]}{doh}	% an array of data
\newcommand{\mydata[2]}{ray}
\newcommand{\mydata[3]}{me}
.....
.....
\newcommand{\mydata[20]}{snark}
\newcommand{\mylimit}{20}

\newcommand{\myotherdata[1]}{uncle} % another array
....
\newcommand{\myotherdata[20]{all}

\mytable{\mydata}

I find myself needing to do this sort of thing - reusing tables.
Actually, they are more like forms than tables.

Perhaps I am just being lazy, or daft.  Or, perhaps it would be better
to use Perl than Latex ?

Thanks.

Memoir have commands for autogenerating tables.

\documentclass{memoir}

\newcommand\mytable[2]{\autocols{l}{2}{l}{#1,#2}}

\begin{document}

\mytable{%

\fancyfoot[R]{\slshape \textnormal{\thepage~of~\pageref{doc:end}}}

And, the end of my \appendix is mostly tables, there are 2 pages of
floats.  I don't have any positional characters in the tables and
it seems page numbering stops before the floats.

\label{doc:end}
\end{document}

and the last float has "23 of 21" on the bottom of the page. I
think I see the logic but is there anyway to get "23 of 23"?

Your problem is that \label{doc:end} triggers BEFORE the last page is
actually shipped out and therefore doesn't necessarily get the correct
number.

Try the "lastpage" package - it does the job properly.

I failed to find in the memoir manual(s) the answer to the following question:

memoir numbers sections as 3.5 where 3 is the chapter number (if there
are no chapters it would be 0.5) Is there an easy way to number
sections by 1 digit (and subsections by 2 digits etc)?

Thank you in advance

Dear TeX hackers,

I am trying to include references in my CV with the bibunits package,  
and I find that this generates an asterisk in the margin at the  
beginning of each reference listing.
I have used the bibunits package with success (i.e., no asterisk)  
with a different CV style file, so I am not sure what it is that is  
causing this particular style file (res.cls) to interact badly with  
my references.

I have found an occurrence of the same type of problem in this  
archive, but I am not sure how to even begin to apply the  
mysteriously simple solution to my case:

	http://tug.org/mail-archives/texhax/2006-July/006443.html

I did try the other suggestion in the archived thread, which was to  
eliminate references to starred section/chapter headings (chapter*)  
and the like.  I found one call to a starred tabular environment in  
res.cls, but, commenting out its definition (and removing my  
reference to it in the tex file) failed to remove the pesky asterisk.

Below are pointers to all the files in question.
If anyone has any insight (or maybe a nice, simple CV style that  
doesn't have this issue?), I'd be so amazed.
I'm reluctant to go blindly hunting around for a new CV style or,  
worse, go back to typing in references by hand.

Best regards,

-natalia

In case anyone is curious, here is a solution, from Erik Demaine.

I put the suggested code in my main file, above \begin{document}.
Presto. No more asterisk!

Hi Natalia,

This seems to do it:

\makeatletter
\def\section{\@ifnextchar*\@@section at star\@@section}
\def\@@section at star*{\@@section}
\makeatother

The issue is that \thebibliography makes a \section*,
but the res.cls format you're using only supports \section
(with the same meaning as regular LaTeX \section*).
The code above makes \section{blah} and \section*{blah} equivalent
to \@@section{blah}, which is where res.cls actually defines sections.

I am sorry that I currently lack the time to test the files mentioned
in order to reproduce your problem, just one point: Have you
considered typesetting your CV with a standard (or KOMA-Script or
Memoir) LaTeX class? I use scrreprt.cls from KOMA-Script for my CV and
\chapter* and \section* commands for sectioning. This way including a
bibliography is no problem whatsoever.

J?rgen.

Hi Thanh,
I suppose that you looked into Robin's FAQ already.  As far as I
understand, it is unlikely that there is a solution.

The LaTeX manual (Lamport) says that both, \twocolunm and \onecolumn
start a new page.  I fear that these commands switch between two
output routines and the twocolumn output routine more or less treats
a column like page.  If this is true it's hard to achieve what you
want.  

All the best,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <33524.200.19.177.49.1189197934.squirrel@alu.dc.ufc.br>

Hi!

Having been using LaTeX for more than two years, I have now decided to learn
TeX. I've just finished chapter 6 of the TeXbook.

But I'm from Brazil and I need to use accents quite often. When I used LaTeX,
that wasn't a problem, 'cause all I needed to do was to write
"\usepackage[latin9]{inputenc}". But now I'm in TeX and, as I expected, it
doesn't know what "\usepackage" is.

Could anyone help me with this? Thanks in advance!

Pablo Mayckon.

P.S.: As I tried to indicate in the subject of this message, I would like to
type accents in a straightforward manner, that is, "?" and not "\'a".

\catcode`\?=13
\def?{\'a}
?
\bye

Since you have the texbook, I don't have to explain a lot.  Characters
of \catcode 13 are called active characters and behave like control
sequences.  The second line gives this control sequence a meaning.

  Reinhard

What you are "in" is the *plain* TeX format, which is extremely limited,
using only the computer modern font at 10 pt.  eplain gives you more.
But you probably want to use a font already encoded in something like
latin9.

Hi Donald,
it seems that in this case neither using eplain nor re-encoding fonts
is helpful.  Pablo is familiar with LaTeX but he said:

 >> I have now decided to learn TeX.

If a LaTeX user buys and studies the TeXbook, I assume that he want
to learn how things work *in plain TeX*.

What I don't understand is that you say that only cmr10 is supported
by plain TeX.  You can use any font in plain TeX.  Things are not as
convenient as in LaTeX, eplain, or Context, but I think that it's ok
for Pablo not to use any macro packages because I assume that it's
more important for him to understand how things work, or, with other
words, as they are described in the TeXbook.

Mentioning any macro packages certainly distracts Pablo from reading
the TeXbook.  

And exactly this is the reason I didn't tell him that many things are
explained more comprehensible in

Hi,

I am often using in my books and articles Knuth's "dangerous bend"
road sign (with the same semantics as in his TeXBook).

I have seen in Spivak's Joy of TeX a road-splitting (opposite of
margin) sign used to mark digressions, and I believe I saw somewhere
another road sign with an exclamation symbol in it (another road
"code" for danger).

Is there a collection of TeX/LaTeX fonts that has some or all such
signs? (manfnt has only the "original" dangerous bend)

Thanks and cheers

I would be very graetful for any suggestions about the following.
 
I have Tex version 4.2 in my PC (desktop).
 
It's set for Latex.
 
No problems for 2-3 years until just now.
 
A Tex document was sent to me as an email attachment two days ago. I unwisely saved it in my Version 4.2 file.
 
Since then I am having trouble with any new Version 4.2 Tex document.
 
When I hit "typeset" I get a "can't find" message, preceded by the statement "This is Tex Version 3.14159 (PTITEX)".  
 
What can I do?

Well, it begs the question of why he's using Plain TeX instead of LaTeX:

This could be handled by using xetex instead:

If Pablo is interested in using Plain TeX for some reason other than  
developing a facility for low-level macros, XeTeX may be more  
comfortable.

Hello, guys. I thank you all for the messages.

In fact, I decided to learn TeX because I found myself doing things in LaTeX
which, I thought, had more to do with typesetting itself, rather than with
concentrating on the contents of the text and letting LaTeX do the formatting
(the latter being the basic philosophy of LaTeX). I also read that TeX is a
special purpose programming language, and, being a computer science student, I
was willing to make use of such generality and flexibility.

On the other hand, I think that plain TeX's basic treatment of accents ("\'a"
and so on) is not appropriate for someone whose native language practice
involves using a lot of accents. In particular, I wonder if this treatment
would not have been made easier if Knuth spoke Portuguese :-) (or French or
some other language with accents). And, believing that the fact that [typing
accents through control symbols is not appropriate for everyday use] was quite
clear, I decided to ask you (TeX users) what people usually do about.

>From the time I wrote my previous message until now, I have been using the
"catcode" suggestion, and it works. But the task of teaching TeX what each
accented letter "means" (both lower and upper case occurrences), putting this
in an "accents.tex" file and \input'ing this file into my text was rather
boring, and, although it's all done now, I feel that there should be a better
way of doing this (I mean, if we are heading towards a fair
internationalization of the world :-)).

    I feel that there should be a better way of doing this

Modulo XeTeX et al. with native Unicode support, there is no better way.
LaTeX does the same thing -- that's just how TeX works.

The amazing thing is that Knuth was able to implement something so many
years before "internationalization" even existed as a word that can
nevertheless be adaptable today.  He never thought control sequences
would be used for general input in non-English languages, but it wasn't
a problem he could solve, back then.

Anyway, I have a dim recollection of a plain tex macro package being
posted to CTAN fairly recently to handle 8-bit input, but I couldn't
find it in a bit of searching.  Sorry.  (It's not the fontch package,
which I don't think does anything on the input side.)

If typesetting/layout is important for you I strongly recommend to
have a look at context.  Latex's philosophy is that you concentrate on
the content and control the layout by using macro packages.  Sometimes
you don't find a macro package which does exactly what you want.  I
assume that this is the reason you decided to learn plain tex.

I'm sure that context is better for you because it gives you more
control about the layout and supports the input and font encodings
already.  In plain tex you have to do everything yourself.

I don't know much about context, but I'm sure that it is much less
dangerous in context to insert plain tex code than it is in latex.
Hence, if you really need something which is not supported, the
TeXbook is your friend.

There is one thing you probably don't know because you are too young.
When Knuth wrote tex, there had been no Portuguese keyboards available.

At this time only privileged computer users had access to a terminal.
Students had been bothered with punch cards at this time.  And there
had not been anything else but ASCII.

After people spent an enormous amount of time to write such macro
packages, they usually/hopefully upload them to CTAN so that other
people can share their work.

BTW, it is quite reasonable that there is a control sequence for each
non-ASCII character.  I have access to Portuguese characters though I
have a German keyboard and you have access to German characters though
you have a Portuguese keyboard.

Well, as you noticed yourself, it's a lot of boring work.  But this
work had already be done for latex and context.  You can be sure that
the people who provided this stuff had been bored or even frustrated,
too.

If you prefer to stick with plain tex I fear that you you have to
re-invent a lot of other wheels yourself.

Anyway, if my assumptions about your intentions are halfways correct,
I think that context is a good thing for you.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I'm not completely sure I understand the question. The line in your  
example that the verse package numbers as the fifth line really is  
the fifth line. Perhaps it is a confusion over the meaning of "line."  
Verse numbers verse lines, but you might have in mind what dramatists  
mean by "line," which is to say, "speech," which would mean that the  
second time
\man speaks he speaks one "line" (although two lines of verse).

If the latter is what you mean, you might use poemscol rather than  
verse to number the lines, using its sentence numbering rather than  
its line numbering commands.  (Use the latex commands for verse,  
rather than the poemscol commands for verse, and use the poemscol  
commands to mark "lines" in your sense.) Mark the line (in your sense  
of line) with \pmsentence rather than with \verseline.

\begin{nitpick}

Wasn't ebcdic available?

I believe though it'd be better to say something like, ``ASCII was  
the only widely-accepted character encoding standard among a myriad  
of manufacturer-specific and special-purpose ones, and other  
standards which didn't become popular.''

Good point. ``system'' (or convention) would've been a much better  
word to use.

Message-ID: <C30D836E.1148%dafshartous@med.miami.edu>

Hello all,

I'm trying to run LaTeX (downloaded textex-base 3.0-1001 from fink.org) on
my Mac OS X 10.4.1 (through emacs21 from fink.org  X11 from Apple).
However, when compiling a particular file.tex, I receive the error:

! LaTeX Error: File `srcltx.sty' not found

Does anyone know the additional tex packages I need to download from the
fink.org?

Thanks!
David

Wouldn't you prefer to install MacTeX ( http://www.tug.org/mactex/ )?  
It's TeXLive 2007 for Mac OS X.

Axel,

Is there a big difference between textex-base and what I get from MacTeX?

Assuming that I do install MacTeX, how do I insure that running latex calls
the MacTex version as opposed to the fink version?  Or should I just
uninstall textex-base?


Thanks,
David

   I'm not completely sure I understand the question. The line in your  
   example that the verse package numbers as the fifth line really is  
   the fifth line.

What you see in my original post are septenary lines--they, like all
lines of verse are counted one at a time.  In verse dialog, a line can
be broken up between more than one speaker and in this case, the line is
counted when it is complete.  Maybe you have some Shakespeare on your
shelf and can see this demonstrated in his heroic lines of dramatic
verse, which is constituted by iambic pentameter lines.  It's a little
rarer, but the same thing can be found in non-dramatic verse and the
line is also counted when it is complete.

I've never used the verse package to typeset my non-dramatic verse and
your response has caused me to want to do it just to look at the
documentation and commands, see below.

   Perhaps it is a confusion over the meaning of "line."

I wouldn't say one is confused, just uninformed, right?

   Verse numbers verse lines, but you might have in mind what dramatists  
   mean by "line," which is to say, "speech," which would mean that the  
   second time
   \man speaks he speaks one "line" (although two lines of verse).

   If the latter is what you mean, you might use poemscol rather than  
   verse to number the lines, using its sentence numbering rather than  
   its line numbering commands.

Um, no, this is fundamental to verse drama, which the documentation of
dramatist says it is meant to typeset, and does in a very nice way.  The
dramatist package's line numbering is broken.

  (Use the latex commands for verse,  
   rather than the poemscol commands for verse, and use the poemscol  
   commands to mark "lines" in your sense.) Mark the line (in your sense  
   of line) with \pmsentence rather than with \verseline.

Right, (I don't even know the correct language to use but,) I guess,
similar to dramatist's `\\!', which ends a speech, another macro (?) and
it's concomitant line-ending command that suspends line numbering so
that a line is counted when it is complete, needs to be
developed--fixing dramatists broken line numbering.

John, thank you for replying to my post as I was looking forward to
getting a dialog started so that I can contribute something back to the
wonderful world of LaTeX.

My question put more succinctly, where do I start?  I'm aware that there
are several packages involved and I am hoping someone can pinpoint where
where the work needs to be done.

Thank you.

Check the MacTeX website <http://www.tug.org/mactex/> and see what it says  
about "Support for Multiple TeX Distributions".

    much less
    dangerous in context to insert plain tex code than it is in latex.

FWIW, that's not my experience.  context and latex seem more or less
equally far away from plain -- lots of things work, some things don't,
and very little is "officially" supported.

I think the philosophies of context and latex are pretty similar too:
lots of logical stuff, some physical stuff.

A colleague mentioned CTAN:macros/latex209/contrib/misc/isolatin1.sty to
me, which despite being in the latex209 tree has almost nothing
latex-specific (at a glance, just the trivial \@ifundefined).  It is the
same boring list of 8-bit chars being mapped to commands ...

Happy encoding,
karl

So sorry for not being able to reply; fortunately, Morten H?gholm  
did. I hope you have followed his advice to check about MacTeX's  
support (thanks to Gerben Wierda and Jerome Laurens) for multiple  
distributions.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0709131224120.11580-100000@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

A week or so ago, I wrote to this list of my problems installing tex under 
Vista.  TexLive2007 installed and even ran properly (as far as I tested 
it, which wasn't very far), but for some undetermined reason, dviout could 
not make fonts.  Finally Karl Berry recommended I write to the Miktex 
support group, which I did and, not without one or two problems, installed 
Miktex.  It seems to run fine and the viewer, Yap, has no trouble making 
fonts.  The one post-installation problem I had was adding an fd file and 
running mktexlsr.  It claimed the file (presumably lsr) was in use.  Later 
it ran and I can only assume there was still some installation going on in 
the background.

Thanks to all for your suggestions and I can only advise others to try 
miktex.  I assume TexLive2008 will have fixed this, but there is no way of 
knowing.

OK. Now I understand. You have in mind situations where one verse  
line is divided among several speakers:
Caesar:
I have just now arrived from Rome!
Brutus:
                                                                Oh no!

This would be one iambic pentameter line. I think you do want to use  
the poemscol package, which has the \brokenline and \versephantom  
commands for setting lines like these. This would be one line, as far  
as the line counter is concerned, although it is divided among two  
speakers. Poemscol works smoothly with dramatist, I understand.

Not really ---present day LaTeX, in all platforms, uses pdfTeX as its  
engine, but pdfTeX can output DVI as well as PDF.

In TeXLive 2007 for Mac OS X distribution (a.k.a. MacTeX) you get  
TeXShop as a front-end. You can tell TeXShop to typeset using  
``Pdftex'' (PDF output) or ``TeX and Ghostscript'', which outputs a  
DVI, then uses dvips and then distills the PS using either  
Ghostscript or Apple Distiller.

As far as I know, TeXLive is the same for all platforms. MacTeX just  
adds some utilities and a control panel to shift from one TeX  
distribution to another without messing with your path. In one  
machine I have, for example, Gerben Wierda's teTeX-based  
distribution, GW's TeXLive-based distribution and MacTeX.

To avoid the doubled `#' in \write, define this:

  {\catcode`\#=12
  \gdef\hash{#}}

and then say

  \immediate\write\myfile{\halign{\hash&\hash\cr a&b\cr}}

(\write doubles the macro parameter character (catcode 6), which is
`#' in plain TeX).

My first idea was to use the memoir class.  Am I wise ?

Message-ID: <200709172024.09127.natercia@eq.uc.pt>

Hi!

I'm using nomentbl (that uses nomencl and longtable) to make the nomenclature 
of my document.
When I turn on the option refpage, the page numbers I get in the nomenclature 
list aren't correct (better: some are correct, some are incorrect).
If I also turn on the option refeq, apparently all the equation references are 
OK.
Can someone give me a hint why nomencl is not working properly?


I am also using the hyperref package, so if I click on the reference of the 
equation associated with the symbol I'm describing it really takes me to the 
correct place in the document.
But if I click on the page number it takes me to a wrong page (that is, it 
correctly takes me to the wrong page that was indicated there).

Thanks a lot!
Nat?rcia

PS - The order these packages are put in my file is (as advised):

\usepackage[pdfpagelabels,pagebackref]{hyperref}
\usepackage[portuguese,refeq,refpage]{nomentbl}

Are you sure you're runnning LaTeX enough times?  The page numbers change
slightly from run ro run until the document is stable.

Hello!

Thanks Philip and Anne for your answers.

Philip, I guess your hint was correct, I was "pdflatexing" once then I would 
do makeindex for getting the nomenclature, and only then I would do pdflatex 
several times to get the document stable.  But the nomenclature had been made 
when it was still unstable.

Anne,
yeah, I see what you mean, but nomencl indicates not a float but the last 
equation that appears in the document before setting the \nomenclature 
command. I would get this eq OK, but the page was not the page of such 
equation.

Maybe here I can give you a suggestion:  links for equations, tables, itens, 
chapters, sections, etc do work fine for you right?  the hyperref links 
that "don't work" are the ones of text labels, right?
Just add \phantomsection:

\phantomsection\label{txt:mylabel} some text

Thanks to both!

Dear Sir,
In the code that follows \zzn is a count register,
\irrrdgts is macro containing 0 or 1,
and \vrz{0pt} is just a phantom character, a line of width 0.
The code is part of a \newif construction used with \loop...\repeat.
I apologize if I haven't  provided enough code to show the problem.

\zzn=\irrrdgts\vrz{0pt}\ifcase\zzn\rlnfalse\else\rlntrue\fi

It works with the phantom  but without the phantom,
and this is what I don.'t undersatand,  its goes into
an infinite loop.

An explanation would, as always, be very much appreciated.

Hi,

I'm pretty new to TeX programming, so my understanding of it is pretty
shallow. I'm trying to write a latex class at the moment and hit the
following problem.

I have a register created with \newtoks\list, it's content is roughly

	{AA \mysep{BB \mysep CC \mysep DD} \mysep{EE} }

Now the problem is, how do I count the number of \mysep-s? I first
tried to replace all of them with a step in the counter (idea from tex
by topic)

	\def\mysep#1{\advance\mycount1\relax}\the\list

And now the counter has a number.
But that obviously doesn't take into account the nesting. Now I could
just redefine it to:

	\def\mysep#1{\advance\mycount1\relax #1}\the\list

Now I get the correct number, but now it also outputs AA BB CC DD EE.
In other words I need a way to expand the list but discard the output,
I only need the `by product'.

Any ideas on this?

grts Tim

Hi TeXnicians,

I often need to type subscripts in math mode that are roman instead of
italic. To avoid having to do a \mathrm every time, I defined

\catcode`\_=\active
\def_{\sb\mathrm}

so I can have roman subscripts with $X_{ff}$ and italic subscripts with
$X\sb{ff}$.

My question is: Since I have some experience in using TeX, but very little
experience in programming TeX, are there any disadvantages to this method?

Thanks,

Paul

Subject: [texhax] Problem creating new environment based on verbatim
Message-ID: <003001c7fa35$b23e0c50$4101a8c0@biggus>

Hey all,

I've dozens of verbatims, all with fancy formatting which may change in
time, so I want to encapsulate the formatting in a new environment. I
have...

+++

\usepackage{fancyvrb}

\newenvironment{myverbatim}%
{%
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single,framerule=0.2pt,frame
sep=1em]	% !!
}
{%
\end{Verbatim}
\end{table}
}

\begin{document}

\begin{myverbatim}
blah
blah
blah
\end{myverbatim}

\end{document}

+++

...but this won't work, since anything after the !! line is interpreted
as part of the Verbatim environment, and therefore the new environment
is never properly defined (or so my hazy reasoning goes).

Is there a way around this?

Kind regards,

James

Howdy,

I know I have done this before, but be danged if I can remember how I  
did it.

I want a citation to read "(described in Alter, 2000)"

but if I use \cite[described in]{Alter2000} I get "(Alter, 2000,  
described in)".

So, what is the command that'll give the former? In other words, will  
put the text at the beginning of the citation, not the end?

Oh, I am using apacite for the bib style.

Why not put the output in a box (and then forget about it)? For example:

\def\mysep#1{\global\advance\mycount1#1}\setbox0\hbox{\the\list}

(The global is needed to advance the counter despite the nesting.)

You expand \ifcase while parsing the number to be assigned to \zzn,
thus before the assignment is actually made.

Use \relax or a space instead of a "phantom character" to terminate
an explicit number.

Thanks Anne,

That's what I thought but for some reason it hasn't been working.  
After your email (which confirmed I wasn't going totally mad) I had  
another comb through the apacite manual and found what I had been  
looking for (which may negate your confirmation).

The correct syntax I need looks like this:
\cite<prefix>[suffix]{label}

In this case \cite<described in>{Alter2000} gives me what I want.

NO NO NO!!!

\list is already taken!

\begin{list}


In answer the the question, use \global\advance, and put it all in
\setbox\@tempboxa\hbox{\global\mycount=0\relax
 \def\mysep#1{\global\advance\mycount1\relax}%
 \the\listofwhatever}

Hi to all TeX users.

With plain TeX:
I wish to have something like that:

1. This is the title of paragraph 1, which is very very long, so I don't know

12. This is  the title of  paragraph 12, which has  a  different  indentation
    because of `12' in place of `1'.

-------------------------%<---------------------------------------------------


Can anybody suggest how to get that?  The title should be flush right; whereas
the number should be flush left; and the same glue should be between the number
and the title.

Thanks for any reply,

You need to hide things that don't work in the latex portion of the
processing:

\usepackage{ifpdf}
\ifpdf
   \usepackage{index}
\else % provide dummy replacements
   \let\index=\relax
   \let\printindex=\relax
   \let\makeindex=\relax
\fi

Message-ID: <5e839cda0709230516v76413cb2wd17792f49648d170@mail.gmail.com>

Does anybody know how to solve that?

I have had problems with the building of the table of contents when I am
using the Harvard Package and  the names of the sections of my document are
large... Instead of truncating the line with the name of the section
when the name of the section (in the table of contents) does not fit in the
same line, it does not occur  and the line goes on until the name of the
section reaches the right margin.

Another problem that I have is when I want to cite a reference inside the
section area like this \section{Name of the section~\cite{reference}}... I
cannot simply compilate the document!

Thank you in advance!

I have been looking up on enumerations in Kopka and Daly, but have not

enumerations with normal paragrphs between them, where each new

like this:

1 Item one

2 Item two

Normal paragraph ...

3 Item three

I am sure this must be possible, but I cannot see how.  Any suggestions?

Try the "mdwlist" and/or "enumitem" packages, as suggested in the TeX FAQ
(linked at the bottom of the page - note that there is a pdf version
available too).

Message-ID: <46F8A8A0.4010303@curtin.edu.au>

Hi

I've been reading through the documentation at http://www.tex.ac.uk and 
trying a number of packages but so far have not yet found a solution to 
a , I believe, simple Latex/Bibtex problem.

Any help would be much appreciated to the following question: "how could 
I tell Bibtex to reverse the order of numbering in the bibilography 
section?"

Context: I have a large BibTex file from which I can produce a *.bbl 
file and included in my Latex file via \input{*.bbl} (Btw, there are 
several hundered papers in the list and I need to use bib2bbl 
(http://www.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/~abel/bib2bbl/index.html) to do batch 
processing.)

Howver, for CV/resume and other reporting purposes, it is desirable to 
reverse the numbering order and the most recent papers appear first (so 
that the reader will know how many papers right from the first page), 
for example

[10] Authors, title, paper in 2008
 [9] Authors, title, paper in 2007
 ...
 [1] Author, title, paper in 1990


Thanks in advance

Sonny

Thank you Phil for your reply.

Your idea seems coincident with my initial thought. Thanks to the example at 

http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/mark/exe7.html 

I have found a quick (though not elegant) fix to this, so I post it here

in case some one else might also be interested:

Solution: Suppose the total number of references in myfile.bbl is 100, then 

===================================================
\newcounter{pointnumber}
\setcounter{pointnumber}{101}
\makeatletter
\renewcommand*{\@biblabel}[1]{[\thepointnumber \addtocounter{pointnumber}{-1}]}
\makeatother
\input{myfile.bbl}
====================================================

The only disadvantage is that I need to supply the number 101 manually.

Someone out there might have a better solution?

Regards

Sonny

I don't know of any BibTeX styles that do this, but at a guess (i.e. I
haven't tried this), it should be possible to modify your favourite BibTeX
style file by changing the year it uses for ordering to, say 9999-year.
Sorry, I just haven't time to go into this further.

Sonny,

I had to do something similar recently, namely to count the number of
names and use that count in my text. The names were in an inputted file,
each introduced by a command that incremented a counter (you have
biblabel). All that was then needed was to get the final value of that
counter into the .aux file and it became available for use for the next
latex pass.

Here's what I did, which (a) may not be elegant and (b) would need to be
modified for your use:

Firstly, to get things out into the aux file requires a command, in the
preamble of the main .tex file (or you could just use @auxout surrounded
by \makeatletter, etc. where you need/use it - I like to keep anything
potentially dangerous like this in my preamble where I can see it):

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% preamble material %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newcounter{nnames}   % my counter

% define a command to write to your auxfile available for your use
\makeatletter
  \def\writetoaux#1{\protected at write\@auxout{}{#1}}
\makeatother

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

then where the file is input:

% note: at the top of signatures.tex is a 
% \setcounter{nnames}{0}
% to restart the count for each pass

\input{signatures.tex}  % each name has a command that increments nnames
\writetoaux{\protect\setcounter{nnames}{\arabic{nnames}}}

This generates a line like:

\setcounter {nnames}{372}

in my .aux file.

With the above, your entire latex document knows about a counter nnames
that has one of two values:

Before signatures.tex is input, it's the count it had from the previous
pass.

After signatures.tex it will be the count from the current pass.

So, I THINK you could achieve what you need by 

1  allocating  new counter, say totalbibcount, in your preamble
Then in your code fragment below
2  set your pointnumber equal to totalbibcount
3  reset totalbibcount to zero
4  renew your biblabel to increment totalbibcount as well as decrement
pointnumber
5  input your bbl
6  write out totalbibcount to the aux file.

Theoretically speaking, this should work :-)

There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to that, but a couple of

Message-ID: <20070927.133423.23241.0@webmail19.vgs.untd.com>

Gentlepeople,

Robin L gave me your email address to seek advice re my installation of the ProTeXt suite.  Sure hope you have the answers.

I received the DVD many days ago and installed the ProTeXt suite on a PC with Win XP and all went according to the interactive installation instructions in the pdf file. I was able to process a sample file with an eps figure (via the package psfig or another package spelled something like graphics - the only difference I could see was where the figure title is re the drawing). I am now trying to install the ProTeXt suite on a PC with Win 2K, installed with FAT32.  The installation goes ok until I try to get packages recognized. My recollection is that they were installed in C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.5\tm\packages with Win XP.  I now find them in C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.5\tpm\packages, but when I browse to that location I get a message that the path does not appear to be the repository for the packages.

Today I re-installed the ProTeXt suite, invoking now the 'Complete MiKTeX' which apparently does install all the packages ok.  Now I am able to get a pdf file for the sample LaTeX file (with an eps figure) that I previously used with Win XP.  However, now I find that the TeXnicCenter editor does not accept any changes to the LaTeX file.  I can use another editor but it does seem a shame not to have the whole working.

I could not find any discussion on this aspect of the editor in the TeXnicCenter web site. Alternatively, neither have I found a discussion of how to install packages for my situation at the MiKTeX site. Perhaps you have some insight.

I have sent a request for info to protext at tug.org but have not received an answer after 2 days so I must have not correctly followed the instructions on the Web page.

Thanks,  Terry

I thought this worked nicely, but now I am finding that for some
strange reason, the first \ifx always returns true; if I comment it
out, then the next one will be true.

I checked with simply "printf" debugging, and while \curref may be
e.g. 42 and \curchap is 3,

  \ifx\curref\curchap\refsame
  \else\refother\fi

will print \refsame instead of \refother. This is really
disconcerting, especially since I am sure it worked when I sent the
post I quoted above in january.

Does anyone have a clue what could be going on? I am at a loss and
about to go bonkers over this.

Cheers,

Subject: [texhax] Searching for a calligrafic font
Message-ID: <87zlz5976z.fsf@gmail.com>

I'm looking for a calligrafic font besides the one you get with the \cal
command in plain TeX, another calligrafic font that be more `round' and soft.
Can anybody provide any suggestion?

Thanks
Rodolfo

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0709290841520.27034-100000@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

I use Zapf chancery which is a very nice font with both capitals and lower 
case.  However, I find the design size too small and I use what I call 
pzcbig, with the following ot1pzcbig.fd file:

\ProvidesFile{ot1pzcbig.fd}
   [2000/01/12 PSNFSS-v8.1 font definitions for OT1/pzc.]

\DeclareFontFamily{OT1}{pzcbig}{}

\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{mb}{it}{
   <-> s*[1.2] pzcmi7t
}{}

\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{m}{it}{<->ssub * pzc/mb/it}{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{mb}{sl}{<->ssub * pzc/mb/it}{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{m}{sl}{<->ssub * pzc/mb/sl}{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{m}{n}{<->ssub * pzc/mb/it}{}

\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{m}{ui}{<->ssub * pzc/m/it}{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{pzcbig}{b}{ui}{<->ssub * pzc/b/it}{}
\endinput


When the above fd file is available, the declaration

  \fontfamily{pzcbig}\selectfont

will select a font family "pzcbig", which is made up from the same
fonts as the family pzc (Zapf Chancery), however, scaled to 120% of
its "natural" size.

Thanks for your help, I tried pzc (with plain TeX I did: `\font\myfont=pzcmi'),
but it's quite similar to `\cal'.  I wish something much more `round'.

Thanks,
Rodolfo

These definitions are all wrong - missing braces.
In fact you are only defining \curpart, and that with very
convoluted "syntax" for use.

This may not be the solution, but why are you still running a beta release
of an outdated version of MiKTeX?  There is now a stable version 2.6 and a
beta 2.7.  Beamer is now at version 3.07 (2007/03/11), although the problem
may well lie with pgf, which is now at version 1.18.

Cheers,  Phil

Thank you for taking the time to respond!!!

So you mean \edef\curpart{\thepart}?

I tried

  \edef\curpart{\thepart}%
  \edef\curchap{\thechapter}%
  \edef\cursec{\thesection}%
  \edef\cursubsec{\thesubsection}%
  \edef\cursubsubsec{\thesubsubsection}%
  \def\curref{#2}%
  \def\refsame{#3 SAME}%
  \def\refother{#1~#2 OTHER}%
  \ifx\curref\curchap\refsame%
    \else\ifx\curref\cursec\refsame%
      \else\ifx\curref\cursubsec\refsame%
        \else\ifx\curref\cursubsubsec\refsame%
          \else\refother%
        \fi%
      \fi%
    \fi%
  \fi%

and now I get the exact opposite effect: now it's always
\refother... I still must be doing something wrong...

Subject: [texhax] algorithm2e - width
Message-ID: <Pine.SOC.4.64.0709301145440.9487@cse.unl.edu>



I'd like to limit the "width" of an algorithm (with a framed box) using 
the algorithm2e package.  I currently do this by placing a parbox around 
the environment and restricting the width manually.  However, to do this 
around a floating body is not possible, apparently.  So I have to use the 
[H] placement option which makes it not a floating body.

Is there a way to restrict the width (say .75\textwidth) to an 
algorithm(2e) environment but retain the behavior of a floating object?
