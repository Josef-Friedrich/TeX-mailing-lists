Just comment out the spaces before the closing brace of your new 
heading definitions as below:

\renewcommand{\subsubsection}{%
\renewcommand{\@seccntformat}[1]{({\csname the##1\endcsname})~~}%1
\@startsection
{subsubsection}%
{3}% 3 is the level for subsubsection
{5mm}% Indent subsubsections
{-\baselineskip}% skips 1 baseline after end of previous subsubsection
{0.5\baselineskip}% half baseline and the first paragraph starts
{\normalfont\normalsize\scshape}% NEW COMMENT
}

\renewcommand{\paragraph}{%
\renewcommand{\@seccntformat}[1]{({\csname the##1\endcsname})~~}%1
\@startsection
{paragraph}%
{4}% 4 is the level for subsubsubsection (paragraph)
{5mm}% indent paragraph/subsubsubsections the same as subsubsections
{-\baselineskip}% skips 1 baseline after end of previous subsubsection
{0.5\baselineskip}% half baseline and the first paragraph starts
{\normalfont\normalsize\itshape}% NEW COMMENT
}
\renewcommand{\theparagraph}{\roman{paragraph}}
\makeatother

Unpredictable indeed are the effects of spurious spaces!

Message-ID: <200705020021.l420LW227332@f7.net>

Hello everyone,

At long last, I am able to announce the availability of the Y&Y sources.
I've set up a project using Google Code (*):

http://code.google.com/p/yytex/ - project home page
http://yytex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ - browse sources
http://yytex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.txt - top-level README

As I write in the README, I hope Windows programmers will be interested
and able to produce something runnable (the project contains only
sources; I did not feel comfortable releasing binaries without knowing
what proprietary bits might be in them).  And/or that some of the other
pieces (EM fonts, PDF tips, etc.) can be reused in other packages and
programs and distributions.

As I bring my part of the project to a close, I must thank Blenda Horn
for generously donating Y&Y's software assets to TUG for the benefit of
the TeX community, and many others (listed in the README) for helping
bring the distribution to this point.

Thanks,
Karl

(*) I chose to use Google Code because, as a Windows application, Y&Y
TeX isn't eligible to use savannah.nongnu.org or gna.org, and all the
other general hosting sites I know about, like sourceforge.com and
berlios.de, have too many annoying ads for me.

Subject: [texhax] Add Tex Package
Message-ID: <20070502103350.RAPI20143.fep35.mail.dk@post.tele.dk>

I have installed TeXLive/LaTeX from CD, and it works. I have installed packages from CTAN with success. Now I want to install a package by help of Maintenance/Add Tex Package, but that does not work, neither "from Loacl Directory/ZIP files" not "from Internet Download".
Can anybody tell me what the reason is for this? In his guide Rahtz says of the Source Page, that "This page is a bit complex. It will allow you to select two source directories for your TeX Live system (Figure 2, at the bottom). You will need a local source directory and possible a remote source directory."  Is this what I am lacking?
I don't think I have been asked to create these source directories during the installation.
With kind regards

As it's a demerit, it's in units of badness squared,
so I suspect >= 10 000 ^ 2.

But being a demerit, it /may/ not have blackball privileges.

Karl, this has been a major project for you -- no real reward of any
kind will likely come of it to you, other than knowing that we are all
extremely grateful for your having persisted in getting this done. But
maybe someday we'll see some of these sources coming around again,
under a new guise, and know that they're available because you (and,
of course, Blenda!) made the original sources available.

Now it's up to the Y&Y users, as well as other PC-based developers, to
see if there's a way they can mine the sources to further their
development or incorporate some of the truly unique Y&YTeX features
into their implementations.

Thank you again, Karl, so very much.

Ch.

As far as I know, any value >= 10000 is treated the same for such

The TeX Catalogue says ?The underlying philosophy of Zapf's Euler

Yes, for TeX, I presume. For LaTeX:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/

and, *before* it's published, a long (180 pages long!) sample chapter  
of Prof. Gr?tzer's Math into LaTeX, 4th ed.:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Math_into_LaTeX-4/

I would advise you to join the TeX on Mac OS X Mailing List:

Best,

Axel

Yup, that's right. One surefire way to do it is to set to the largest
maximum number in TeX, namely 2^{31} - 1 = 2147483647.

Except for the price tag, yes.  Oh, well; when I need the fonts with
$100 US worth of need, I know where to look.  Until then, I'll play
with Comic Sans

Gentle does nothing for you on the actual mechanics of running plain 
TeX or better pdftex against a file. But it is an elegant and very 
readable tutorial on what goes into that file. I have it posted on my

Message-ID: <3F7B28F577E95F4CBA178B81EEFD0AACC8FE@db1412t.irkutsk.bnk.ru>

Greetings.

1. Is it possible to create a table in LaTeX with FIXED width of the tabular and with the FIXED width of its columns?
I have read the FAQ and tried using tabularx and tabulary packages, but did not succeed. These packages are "too clever" to make table with the width fixed, and even though I use the form
\begin{tabulary}{\textwidth}{|R|L|C|C|L|C|}
For example, the table sometimes is too narrow and sometimes too wide, depending on contents of the cells.
So, the question is: How to create a fixed width table with different fixed width columns?

2. Is it possible to create a table with fixed height of the rows?
For example make all (full and empty) rows' height 2cm. Or make them 2cm and more (if the content of the cell does not fit)? This feature may be extremely useful for preparing some forms and hand-writing them after printing.

Both tasks are piece of cake in MS Word and I suppose there are ways to create such tables in LaTeX as well.

Just this (without something additional) would require that 
table width depends on the widths of the single columns. 
Moreover, it would disable features of l, c, r columns. 
Rather, use tabular* or tabularx for fixed table width, 
together with the array package to define 

    \newcolumntype{C}{>{\centering\arraybackslash}p{2cm}}

or so -- I am steeling this advice from Martin Heller, March 8 this year.

I have installed TeXLive 2007 in my Ubuntu Linux. How can I configure
Linux so it read from my texlive directory instead of the latex
directory that already installed by Ubuntu?
The default latex directory is in /usr/bin/latex. My texlive directory
is /home/tedy/texlive/2007/bin/i386-linux/. I don't want to use
default latex installation, I want to use my texlive installation.

After read texlive 2007 manual, I try to use these command :
$ PATH=/home/tedy/texlive/2007/bin/i386-linux:$PATH export PATH

It's works, but when I restart the system Linux return to see default
PATH (/usr/bin/latex).

Can anybody help me to configure texlive in Ubuntu?

To make a "c" column with fixed width, use the array package and

Set \arraystretch I guess.

You have to put that line in your .profile or .bash_profile. (I don't  
use Linux, but Mac OS; nevertheless, it's the same.)

If you have a .bashrc in your $HOME, it only works for non-login  
shells, that's why you have to create a .profile or .bash_profile in  
your $HOME directory if either of them does not exist. (See your  
Linux manual for help; I'm sure they have some sort of indications.)

I have put those line in my bash_profile so my bash_profile look like this :

============================================
# ~/.bash_profile: executed by bash(1) for login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/login.defs
#umask 022

# include .bashrc if it exists
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    . ~/.bashrc
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d ~/bin ] ; then
    PATH=~/bin:"${PATH}"
fi

PATH=/home/tedy/texlive/2007/bin/i386-linux:$PATH;
export PATH
============================================

But, the problem still happen. Can you tell me how the syntax must be?
Is there syntax are correct?

This is correct, but ~/.bash_profile is only executed if the shell is
a login shell.  It's better to put it into ~/.bashrc.

And your .bash_profile is reading your .bashrc anyway:

so it should work with login shells and non-login shells.

You should logout and log back in for it to work.

Hi,

I  just installed TexShop Version 2.10beta8 (210) on my Macbook Pro.   
Previously I had 2.09 which did not have this problem.  What should I  
do to install the new version correctly?  Thanks,

/usr/texbin/pdflatex does not exist. Perhaps TeXLive was not  
installed or was removed during a system upgrade. If so, go to the  
TeXShop web site and follow the instructions to (re)install TeXLive.  
Another possibility is that a tool path is incorrectly configured in  
TeXShop preferences. This can happen if you are using the fink teTeX  
distribution.

/us/texbin is a symlink to any of the modern TeX distributions on  
Mac: gwTeX-2003-2005, gwTeXLive or TeXLive-2007 (a.k.a. MacTeX):

http://www.tug.org/mactex/

or

http://ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/mac/mactex/

(for gwTeX: http://ii2.sourceforge.net/ )

Front-ends ---like TeXShop, iTeXmac and Carbon Emacs--- set the path  
to this symlink (/usr/texbin), and you choose which distribution you  
want to use in a control panel in System Preferences, a mechanism  
devised by Gerben Wierda and Jerome Laurens to allow you to have more  
than one TeX distro.

That said, if pdflatex is not recognized, then either your TeX distro  
was indeed removed by a system upgrade (as you say above) or is too  
old. Either way you should download at least one from the addresses  
above.


Best,

Axel

Sorry ---I forgot to answer this. Indeed, if your TeX distribution is  
Fink's teTeX (and you don't plan to upgrade to TeXLive), you have to  
change TeXShop default path:

TeXShop -> Preferences -> Engine. Here, instead of /usr/texbin, etc.,  
set the Fink paths for TeX & friends and Ghostscript, etc.


Best,

Axel

Subject: [texhax] euro from gnumeric latex export
Message-ID: <1178469818.4503.23.camel@sony-sjs.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk>

I'm trying to use the latex export from gnumeric to include a table in
my latex document. I'd like to label a column with a euro symbol.
Although gnumeric will describe currenty in euros, the latex export
doesn't recognise it and replaces it by a question mark :-(

So I tried to use a text string \texteuro in the gnumeric cell. In one
of my tables, that generated an unknown command \backslacstexteuro, and
I was able to define this in my preamble to actually generate a euro
sign. However, in a virtually identical gnumeric spreadsheet, the export
plugin generated $\backslash$texteuro which then fails to get recognised
as a command. I suspect that this latter behaviour is actually the
intended one as far as gnumeric is concerned, as it generates latex that
will compile and faithfully treats every character in a string,
includine "\", as a string. I have noticed that the gnumeric export is
not always consistent in whether strings get surrounded by $'s or not.

In brief, does anyone have any experience in exporting a euro from
gnumeric and/or controlling how it handles backslashes and text?

Thanks
Steve

Subject: [texhax] `Times slanted' font?
Message-ID: <87mz0gn1v2.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi to all TeX users.

I use the `Times' font simply with:

 \font\timestwelverm=ptmr at 12pt
 \font\timestwelveit=ptmri at 12pt
 \font\timestwelvebf=ptmb at 12pt

, so having the `regular', italic and bold version of it; but don't know wether
and how it is possible to get the slanted face.

Can anyone suggest that?

Thanks,
Rodolfo

Subject: [texhax] kerning problem when using MinionPro
Message-ID: <e3d1b4df0705070805y363f3a4at4d9b5f1635647fc4@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am typesetting a collection of short stories with the Adobe Minion Pro
fonts I've bought with this purpose in mind. I'm using the MinionPro package
from CTAN , and have set up the font files and all the necessary auxiliary
files exactly as described in the documentation with that wonderful package.

Now everything works fine, except for one niggly-naggly little problem.
Sometimes an apostrophe is used, such as in "She'd" or "Don't". Of course
this literary practice is frowned upon in formal documents, but in fiction
it is often unavoidable, as it is in many instances in this collection. The
problem I encounter is that the kerning of that apostrophe is wrong when
using MinionPro. It looks like pdfLaTeX has typeset - for example - "shed"
and squeezed in an apostrophe as an afterthought, rather than typesetting
"she'd", as it should do.

Now I can of course experiment a bit with manual kerning, and come up with
the right numbers to go with the \kern commands before and after the
apostrophe, but is there a way to fix things documentwide, preferably in my
preamble? Can I set a specific kerning for the apostrophe when used this
way, without having to hand-fix every single instance? And can I do this
without messing up the quotation marks, which in my source file are
designated by the exact same symbol of course. Also, it would be highly
preferable to be able to fix things in the source file I already have rather
than having to go through 80,000+ lines of LaTeX source code in order to
replace any apostrophe used in, for example "don't" or "you'd" with
\apostrophe while leaving the quotation marks or a use like "in the
'eighties" intact. I know one could use regular expressions, but still...

It may or may not be interesting to know that my document has been typeset
in LaTeX, using the Memoir class by Peter Wilson.

Thanks for your help.

Kind regards,
Yuri Robbers.

NImbus Roman and Times Roman are described as visually identical. So I 
would suggest the following lines in pdftex.map as  pointers to a 
suitable slanted Times Roman:
 
ptmro8r NimbusRomNo9L-Regu ".167 SlantFont TeXBase1Encoding 
ReEncodeFont" <8r.enc <utmr8a.pfb
ptmro8y NimbusRomNo9L-Regu ".167 SlantFont TeXnANSIEncoding 
ReEncodeFont" <texnansi.enc <utmr8a.pfb

Just remove the line breaks \\ after the \hline's

Please note that commands like \bf are now obsolete. Use commands like
\bfseries to change fonts. Also, with amsmath the command \text can be 
used to get text within math. Moreover, the command \textsuperscript can 
be used to get superscripts in text-mode.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0705071136030.22216-100000@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

I have never used hyperref myself (although maybe I should, now that I see 
how nice it is) but I am having a problem with a paper for the journal I 
act as editor for.  What an \href does in the dvi file is to underline the 
reference, and in my Yap, v.2.4 viewer, these underlined references 
actually work, although Yap inquires if it is ok to run the browser.  That 
surprised me and it obviously depends on the viewer.

The problem happens when the reference turns out to be hyphenated.  In the 
example below, the reference is broken at an actual internal hyphen.  The 
result is that the entire next line, not just the reference, is 
underlined.  If the result is converted to pdf, only the actual reference 
is put in a colored box.  

Here is a file that illustrates the problem:

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\textwidth 6.3in

\begin{thebibliography}{FRS02~~}

Hi Nabil,
I hacked up something along these lines a couple of years ago to allow
online-proof-reading, it wasn't a success since the world around me uses
?$ word grrr and rather reverts to paper.

I used the pdf forms in conjunction with draft modes, double-linespacing
and line-numbering, so advisors could write directly into the pdf-file
and submit the diffs by email.

If you're further interested and no better ways turn up I'll look u[ the
code.

	a powerful drop-in replacement for BibTeX.
Message-ID: <1178555655.6907.35.camel@rome.systems.cs.cornell.edu>

CrossTeX is a new bibliography management tool that aims to render
bibliographies less error-prone, databases easier to maintain, and
documents easier to cite. It is based on an object-oriented data model
that minimizes redundant information in bibliographic databases. It
enables works to be cited not only through syntactic object keys but
through semantic information that uniquely identifies the work. It also
supports customization and automation to a much greater extent in order
to avoid errors, typos, and inconsistencies in bibliographies, while
providing users with fine-grained control over the typesetting of
references and citations. Other features include support for new object
types, such as URLs and patents, that have become common in citations;
direct generation of HTML documents; easy programmability using a
well-known language; and extensive databases of published works. It is
backwards-compatible with existing BibTeX databases, and, overall,
builds on BibTeX's strengths while fundamentally fixing the problems
that lead to errors in BibTeX-formatted documents.

Downloads, a tutorial, and more extensive information are available at
http://crosstex.sourceforge.net/.

If you think your tool is useful then I think the best thing you can
do is to upload it to CTAN.  See:

I would like to second Reinhard's suggestion. CrossTeX's description
sounds interesting. If you want your tool to be found, used, and
tested by other users you should upload it to CTAN.

BTW, I think it's good news that something is moving in LaTeX
bibliographies. The last major development was the publication of
Philipp Lehman's biblatex package, still under development.

Nice!  I added it to my page

http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html#latex.tex.resources

but the reason I'm writing is to note what happened in your email. 
Apparently you cut and pasted from somehere into a web form. 
Unfortunately the result is a bunch of fused words and unreadable
text.  The fused words were:

% spell < fusedwords
Itenables
alsosupports
anddocuments
automation
awell
butthrough
isbackwards
modelthat
objecttypes
ofreferences
orderto
overall,builds
problemsthat
renderbibliographies
whileproviding

(I removed the irrelevant ones.)

This happens to me on my Mac.  To avoid the problem, I usually write
my text in vi/vim and then format it to 80 characters wide using the
unix fmt tool.  That's how I'm writing this email.  I don't use cut
and paste on the text.

However, if one must cut and paste it into a web browser text window
(as in web based email), the result you got will happen.

To avoid THAT one can format the paragraph very wide:

fmt -w 1000

Cut and paste that output.

A REALLY nice solution would be to have full vim access inside web
browser text windows!!

Jeff,

You could use longtable or supertab and set it one of these multipage
tabular environments. With the array package as well you might even be
able to tell it that the 1st column should be typeset in math mode and
the last as text (or p if you want longer lines), and that there should
always be an equals sign in the middle.

Well, that's the theory, anyway.

                    I'm having a problem with macros that contain a lot of
code, conditionals, loops, some recursion,

                    

                    manipulation  of count registers and so on.  The product
of such macros,  that which is to be typeset,

 

                    often contains unexpected space to the left and / or
right.  Eliminating this space is my problem.  

 

                    I can see no pattern to the amount of such space, if I
could I probably wouldn't need to be writing.

 

                    The amount of this space is usually reduced by
tightening up on the code, 

 

                    by that I mean  removing gaps in the code  (gaps that
most macros I would 

 

                    to leave just to maintain readability, something
important for my failing memory).

 

                    This reduces code to one long line, gaps only at points
where, well, without them there

 

                    is no output or the output is incorrect.  One example of
such a necessary gap is between

 

                    the definition of a count register and an \if.  Like I
said, this helps but it does not eliminate the

 

                    unexpected space.

 

                    I wonder if anyone out there has had experience with
this problem; if so I would be very grateful

Did you finish each line with a percent-sign %?

This could/should be your first step.

Be aware that this will only do as long as you start programs from a
bash shell. If you start i.e. emacs from the menu and launch latex
from within emacs, chances are that still your old ubuntu texlive will
be used. To circumvent this you can
 * add those variable to /etc/environment
 * add a script to the Xsession startup sequence that sets the
variable or sources ~/.profile or the like
 * write a ~/.xsession script to set the varbiables and start your
window manager

                   Some of my macros yield unexpected space to the left and/or

I suggest using \loggingall and look for {blank space  } in the .log file
when the macro is expanded.

The rules of when TeX ignores and doesn't ignore whitespace are
explained in the TeXbook (and probably other places), but can't be
summarized in a couple of sentences.

I'm not sure why, but your email got formatted terribly in my client
(Windogs Outlook); that's why I "snipped" it.

Anyway, a reasonable rule-of-thumb is to put a comment (%) at the end of
every line that would otherwise end with a right brace (}).  That is, write 

  \typeout{Hello Wordl}%

To be more explicit, a simple command with no parameters, such as \par,
\else, \centering etc. will always eat the following space while, say,
\typeout{Hello World} will not (ie, the space will remain as a physical
space in your output).  And the end-of-line character is always interpreted
as a space.

That said, there are, of course, always exceptions.

So, just add end-of-line comments until you're happy.

Cheers,  Phil

Out of curiosity, I've always wondered whether there are any 
circumstances where this would hurt (beyond the obvious one when a 
newline is breaking two separate words)?

The answer's undoubtedly in The TeX Book, I know... :)

Not wishing to offend, but it's worse than "shoestring" since the presence
of something like \llap can cause other problems:

\documentclass{article}
\def\mymacro{%
  \typeout{ello World}
  ello World
}
\begin{document}
Do you prefer H\llap{\mymacro} or H\mymacro?
\end{document}

obviously your post was formated to show your problem.
%
I have experienced a similar problem when writing TeX/LaTeX macros.
%
My fix was to eliminate all blank lines
%
either remove them or put a comment (%) in column 1
as I have done here.
%
You also want to carefully check %
that there are %
or are not appropriate spaces at end of each line.%
%
I hope this reply is not word-wrapped %
since it illustrates my solution.

Yes, but the circumstances are relatively obscure.  The example I recall
from the TB is when TeX is looking for a <space>, the code following is
expandable (\if..., in that case), and it's happening inside an
alignment template.

I've also seen issues when the <space> following a filename (e.g., for
\font or [primitive] \input) is not explicitly present and the following
code is expandable.

Personally, I mostly learned the rules (insofar as I have learned them :)
by looking for {blank space  } in the log files, as I wrote.  That
makes it entirely obvious.

Subject: [texhax] 2 Cross references types in memoir based book
Message-ID: <20070508215349.GF4107@mclink.it>

Greetings,

a few weeks ago, I asked here about "a ready Latex template for a 6 x
9 book" or at least pointers about it. W. Adams (thanks!) was so kind
to point me to the Koma and Memoir document classes.

I have only started recently to study the documentation of Memoir and
to play with it. According to the Memoir manual, I have set the paper
size to 6x9 with the command:

\documentclass[10pt,ebook]{memoir}

and right now am playing with the margin settings to get them right,
but this is not the reason of this request. Now, the book contains
two classes of cross references:

a) references to other chapters of the book
b) references to Internet web pages

Right now these references are all expressed in the tex source as urls
to local (a) or Internet URLs (b) in this form:

\htmladdnormallink{some text}{http://site.com or file://some/chapter}

I would like to transform both kinds of links so they have a different
appearance, ie:

a link of tipe a) to chapter 9 becomes, maybe, a "[9]" written as a
superscript to "some text"

a link of type b) becomes, for example, a subscript "{5/30}" where
5/30 would mean "to know more about this, go to my web page and follow
link #30 of those listed under chapter 5)

	(of course, {5/30} should be written in another way, so it is
	immediately apparent to the eye that it is not a reference to
	another book chapter)

Sorry for the lenghty explanation, I'm still learning the details of
LaTeX and typography terminology. I know how to process the tex source
to transform those expressions in something else with Perl, awk and so
on. My only questions are:

1) which (Memoir) markup do you suggest to mark links a) and b) above?
2) does the general idea makes sense, or is there another more standard/
   stilysh way to achieve the same result?

Thank you in advance,

      Marco

You don't need to use a picture for that, you can use gvim. Load your
LaTeX source in gvim and choose Syntax|Convert to HTML. This will
provide the LaTeX source with the original gvim syntax highlighting in
HTML. You can copy&paste it directly into your HTML pages.

TeX is not like other programming languages: it's not a general- 
purpose language for implementing computer programs.  Can you be more  
specific about what you want to do?

As a rule-of-thumb, if you could have tacked the next line flush, (i.e.,
remove the end-of-line and any spaces) then since a "%" effectively does
just that, there should be no problems.

Maybe not since this is a package writers' issue.

One very common situation when TeX is looking for a <space> is when it
delimits a number.  For example, when running the following through
tex:

  \count0=1%
  2
  \showthe\count0
  \bye

you'd get:

  > 12.
  l.3 \showthe\count0

Hence another rule of thumb:  always leave a <space> after a number
(or put \relax there).  This is particularly nasty when a number comes
before a macro parameter, because you never know what will be in the
parameter:

  \count0=1%
  #1

BTW, watch out for a similar caveat with glues:

  \vskip 1pt
  #1

If #1 happens to start with `plus' or `minus', TeX will either throw
`Missing number' at you (if a <dimen> does not follow `plus' or
`minus'), or add the stretching/shrinking to \vskip.  \relax is your
friend here, too (or else, always specify `plus 0pt minus 0pt').

Best,
Oleg

there's an experimental web service called Mathtran  that converts 
TeX coded (equations) to png pictures. The Open University  is the 
developer. Jonathan Fine alerted me to it. He is probably involved 
with it.

see http://www.mathtran.org 


>From the website.


About MathTran

This website will provide translation of mathematical content, from 
TeX to MathML and vice-versa, and to graphics formats, as a web 
service. The software that provides this service is open source, and 
can be downloaded and installed on your own web-server or desktop 
machine (Unix/Linux only at present).

We are about halfway through the project, and now have TeX running as 
a daemon, providing genuine TeX typesetting as a web service. Please 
click on [Render] above to see it work. Our next priorities are 
translation to and from MathML, and supporting some LaTeX extensions 
to the TeX math notation (such as \frac).

MathTran is being developed at The Open University (the UK's leading 
provider of distance learning) and is funded by JISC (a UK funding 
body that supports innovation in education and research IT) and the 
OU. The project thanks JISC and the OU for their support.

Subject: [texhax] Beamer bug with "cases"-environment in amsmath
Message-ID: <4FD93A12-F835-4223-95D1-6B10D0B90A5E@sidec.com>

Hi,

It seems that there is a bug in Beamer that prevents the usage of  
"\alert<n>" command within the "cases"-environment in the amsmath  
package. This causes a Beamer/LaTeX-complie error whereas the   
corresponding "\alert"command without slidenumber specification works  
fine.

Any ideas for a workaround?

Beamer version: Version 3.06 (TeXLive CD 2007)

Below is a minimal example together with an excerpt from log-file.  
The first "cases"-environment doesn't work whereas the next works fine.

------------ start ------------
\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\begin{frame}

\[
\begin{cases}
   \alert<1>{x} &
\end{cases}
\]

\[
\begin{cases}
   \alert{x} &
\end{cases}
\]

\end{frame}

\end{document}
------------ end ------------

------------ excerpt from log-file ------------
! Argument of \beamer at next has an extra }.
<inserted text>
                 \par
l.22 \end{frame}

Susan,
this is the basic code for the proof-option.
originally it is an option in an organically grown class file.

Some features still do not work, I never found the time (and reason) to
fix them, e.g. the final-remarks form still is missing as are the
correction lines at the end of the document.

The test.tex file should work with any standard tex distrib.

Have fun.

Dear Tug

Please help. I have downloaded a very useful latex template like,
\document{customized_template}, from the internet for writing an article.  I
think this is called a style file. It was installed and compiling fine. A
small but disempowering impediment is that, the template uses the literature
referencing from within tex like, \begin{thebibliography} ..ref1, ..refn
\end{thebibliograph}. I already have all the literature in the compatible
bibtex dbase. So I want to reference the literature from the same like,
\cite{Gop98}.  Please guide me on what instructions I am to give Latex, so I
may reference directly from the bibtex dbase.

Thanking you in advance.

Regards, 

Thabo

Thabo,

There is a stepwise process to undergo when you are using bibtex. I would
suggest you get this pdf, Taming the Beast from
ftp://cam.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/bibtex/tamethebeast/ttb_en.pdf

Read p10 for instructions on how to generate your citations and reference list.

The remainder of the document is fiull with useful and important information
that should answer our questions.

Hello all,


I need to \includegraphics PDF files which have hyperlinks.
To my bad fortune pdftex (3.14159-1.10b (Web2C 7.4.5)) seems to gobble
all pdfmarks.  Can you suggest something I could do about it?

The files I want to include are actually figures converted to PDF,
and I thought it would be cool to turn labels into hyperlinks which
would refer to the paragraph they are explained in the document.
Perhaps an imagemap would do the trick...?  Oh, no.

Best bits,
adam

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0705140908510.27494-100000@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

If you compile the following file

\documentclass{article}
\makeatletter
\check at mathfonts
\newdimen\axis \axis=\fontdimen22\textfont2%
\makeatother
\begin{document}

$$e=mc^2$$
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
$$e=mc^2$$
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx

\end{document}

you will see that there is a spurious indentation in the line following 
the first display, but not the second.  If you comment out the setting of 
\axis, the behavior persists.  If you comment out the line 
\check at mathfonts, you get an error message from the setting of \axis.  If 
you comment out both of those lines, the indentation disappears.  I 
haven't checked it thoroughly, but it looks as though I can work around it 
by simply setting \setbox0=\hbox{$x$}, so it isn't crucial.  Still, it 
seems rather odd behavior.  Is there a better way of getting the mathfont 
recognized?

Here's my version, but it still uses an \hbox !
Philip Taylor
--------
\documentclass {article}
\newdimen \axis
\setbox 0 = \hbox {\makeatletter \check at mathfonts \makeatother}
\axis = \fontdimen 22 \textfont 2

Interesting, but I'll stick to my solution for the nonce.  The full code 
had been 
\ifx\check at mathfonts\undefined
\else \check at mathfonts
\fi

My diagxy macros work just as well in plain tex, but it seems that in 
plain tex those fonts were preloaded.

Joel,

Supporting a wide variety of environments---including Windows and
Macintosh---is a high priority for CrossTeX, but we have not had a
chance to try it out and actually test installing and testing it under
XP/MikTeX yet.  If someone would beat us to it and tell us
(crosstex at systems.cs.cornell.edu) how it works, we would be very
obliged.  It is also on our to-do list right behind a couple of major
feature enhancements, so I should be able to get back to you soon with
my own results.

Sorry I couldn't be of more help; it's a good question and I'd love to
hear more.

Robert

If you don't have the .sty, then I don't think you have the fonts  
either, so get the whole directory (fourier-GUT.zip) and install  
according to the instructions.

Subject: [texhax] Problems with framing a minipage
Message-ID: <000001c796d6$11864b50$4001a8c0@biggus>

Hi,

I'm trying to put a frame around a figure, thus:

+++

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\framebox
{
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\epsffile{figures/Class_heirarchy.eps}
\end{minipage}
}
\caption{The Jasper core class methods and hierarchy}
\label{figure_core_class}
\end{figure}

+++

For some reason the width of the frame is slightly wider than the
textwidth. I have changed this (and the evensidemargin size) in the
preamble, but even when I take these out the problem remains? Why is the
width of the frame not exactly equal to \textwidth?

Thanks muchly!

James

Try:
\usepackage{calc}

\framebox
{% <- no space
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth-2\fboxsep-2\fboxrule}
\epsffile{figures/Class_heirarchy.eps}
\end{minipage}% <- no space

Hi Krewe:

My employer's Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (OCISO)
requires a little bit more information about software than
"I need it to do my job!"
before they will allow it to be installed.

Has anyone written up a brief description of the many *.exe
in any of the various distributions?

fyi: I just received my TeXLive 2007 DVD 
and want to have it installed on my work computer.

example

pdfLaTeX.exe: input : text file 
                      default extension: .tex
              output: Adobe v5 .pdf

When I fill out this form I intend to be thorough 
so as not to leave lingering questions in their minds.
What are other file extensions that may cause concern?
*.dll?

Any pointers would be appreciated.

thanx

Hi Ron,

    Has anyone written up a brief description of the many *.exe
    in any of the various distributions?

There are 389 files in bin/win32.  No, I'm not aware of anything that
gives (say) a one-line description of each one.  That would hardly prove
anything with respect to security, anyway.

The TL documentation describes some of the major programs, of course,
but I doubt that is anything your security people will be interested in.

Maybe the fact that the non-Windows TL is now included in various
GNU/Linux distributions, all of whom are very security-conscious, could
carry some weight?

    What are other file extensions that may cause concern? *.dll?

I imagine so.  .bat comes to mind also.

Good luck,
Karl

Hello all.
I am using hyperref with pdflatex, and I noticed that when the link
(i.e., citation) spans across lines, both parts of the link are
active, but only the first is colored. Does anyone has experienced
this behaviour? workarounds?

Yesterday I was hit by the following (then my head hit the desk, hard):

\somemacro%
	{blahblah}%
	{http://somewhere}

\somemacro being:

\def\somemacro#1{\domesomething#1\begingroup\Url}

i.e. \somemacro gobbled {blahblah} as it should, and by intention let the
processing of {http://somewhere} to the url package.  Poor \Url did his
usual tricks with catcodes and looked for a delimiter---and found what?
A percent character.  Satisfied, it searched for the next percent, screwing
the layout in interesting ways.

It may be worth noting that plain \url in place of \begingroup\Url would
not find the url, even when I removed the percent characters; it is only
\Url which skipped the following whitespace.

bit,
adam

I finally got it:

\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Name}

The right name is \phantomsection, and \cleardoublepage works fine
with oneside and twoside books, no matter where you put it.

Message-ID: <1179417532.15128.8.camel@localhost>

Hello!
Probably, I am asking something that has been asked before.
Nevertheless, by searching the Internet, I didn't find elaborate enough
example for what I need. I am a newbie in LaTeX, and now I would like to
try to make a four-coloumn poster of a0-size. I am using Tetex, under
Ubuntu 6.06 and today I have downloaded 'poster.sty' from CTAN. So, I
would like to ask kindly for some skeleton/template tex-file of
four-coloumn poster (size a0). Could anyone send it to me? And another
thing: is it possible to use 'a0poster.sty' that is a part of MikTeX
with TeTeX?

Thanks in advance,
Petar

the various fractions come out different sizes: in the first, third,

they come out in what appears to be displaystyle, but in the second

they come out markedly smaller.  What is going on?

Ah ha!  A tricky trap.  There are some characters that keep their normal
meaning until the argument delimiters are detected: { } and space.  Maybe
% should be added to this list (making % unavailable as a delimiter).

> It may be worth noting that plain \url in place of \begingroup\Url would

??? It should behave the same.  Maybe it was a different \url command, 
such as the definition provided by hyperref.

Subject: [texhax] Footnotes
Message-ID: <411983.89954.qm@web27803.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

I have a page which contains a footnote (call it page 10). This page is the last page in a section and it is only about 75% full with text. Then there is the footnote. A new section begins on the next page (page 11) because there is not enough space on current page (10).

Now the problem is that when I start a new section and this starts on the next page (page 11), the footnote on the current page (page 10) does not remain at the bottom but moves up to the point where the text finished.

The only way to solve this problem is to use \clearpage just before \section. However, I do not like this solution since I will later have to reprint the document with different margins so this will move things around.

Any ideas please?

Thanks

Well, you're using LaTeX's eqnarray instead of amsmath's align - why?
Have you read a LaTeX manual explaining the use of eqnarray?
In fact, the eqnarray syntax is 
\begin{eqnarray}
  a & = & 1 \\  
  b & = & 2
\end{eqnarray}
that is, the second entry should just be a relation.

Anyway, amsmath defines a much better array environment and also comes with
a perfectly readable manual.

Cheers,  Phil

If people have to typeset math formulas I always recommend to read the
amsmath manual and forget everything they read in the LaTeX docs. 

And I can't resist to say that the way the amsmath manual had been
written

Yes, eqnarray should be avoided.  I recommend to use the onlyamsmath
package whenever applicable.

Message-ID: <56b822010705190706r8ed3d00n17cca50aa2cd486f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

Many journals and publishers require that captions (Legends for
figures and tables) be given at the end of the submitted manuscript
separately and *not* along with their corresponding figures and
tables.

It appears that i might have to do it manually, by removing \captions
all together from figures and tables and putting the caption texts
separately, but i have to be careful, to get the corresponding figure
and table numbers right.

Is there a better way to achieve this. Is anyone aware of a LaTeX
package that can do this? Has anyone had a similar experience while
submitting manuscripts to a publisher or a journal ? If so, how did
you manage to do it ?

I have searched the TeXFAQ and the web, but i am unable to find a solution.

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

Senthil

Consider using 'tabularx' package. You could set p{size} to get the job
done.

Hi Kenneth,

Your "c" columns have the exact width adapted to their contents,
but since there is a multicolumn on the last 4 columns, the last
of them is expanded to match the length needed for the entry in
multicolumn.

If you make the multicolumn entry shorter (eg by splitting it in
two lines), this problem will disappear.  (cf. code below).

I don't know a way to have the extra space spread evenly among
the last four columns (but I'd be interested in knowing!).

Apart from that, you might be interested in the package booktabs
for professional-looking rules (horizontal lines) in tables.
The package longtable is also useful when your tables need to be
allowed to spread over a page break (I use it by default for any
table that stands on its own, i.e. not included in a paragraph).

Best,
Samuel

Because a spanning entry is wider than all the columns
it spans.

TexHax,
I am trying to start using the TeXnicCenter, but I can't make any
progress in the configuration wizard because I'm supposed to have
"already installed a TeX-distribution."  After much searching, I can't
find in any of the online documentation how to do that!  Help??
Thanks very much.

The reason is that the multicolumn entry is too long and this length is 
not evenly divided among the spanned columns. Please see the attached file 
for a solution. I've also included code for a slightly beautified version 
using multirow.

Did you try googling install TeX-distribution?  The second entry points you
straight to MiKTeX.

If you are using windows, install MikTex http://miktex.org/ and then
reinstall TeXnicCenter. TeXnicCenter is supposed to recognize miktex
by itself.

MiKTeX and TeXLive have already been mentioned. Perhaps the hints by
Joachim Schlosser on how to install a complete TeX setup (by now
translated into English) can help you on: MiKTeX, TeXnicCenter,
Emacs+AUCTeX, ispell, installation and using of the latest version of
tex4ht, Ghostscript...

hi, i?d like to apologize for my English it is not very good.

I have a question related to the treatment of the graphics in latex, in the
WYSIWYG programs (word, open-office, etc..) u can put an image in the work
space, send it to the
background and then write over the image, to be more explicit i send a
picture showing that i mean.
As far as i know in latex when u put a picture using

\begin{figure}
  % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{image}\\
  \caption{image}\label{this is a picture of u}
\end{figure}

latex separate a space that can only be occupied by the file name image, so
it?s impossible to write over the image, i?d have to modify the picture in
GIMP or some other program.
Or it?s possible to do the same i show in the attacked picture in latex?????


thx a lot for ur time, o really hope that all u people understand what i
mean.

I (ab)use fancyhdr for this purpose. The trick is to include the  
graphic in the header, move it down to where you want it, then  
typeset your text. Here's a simple example (replace FILE with your  
actual graphic, and vary the amount of shift in the raisebox to taste):

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}

\fancyhead{} % clear all fields
\fancyhead[C]{\raisebox{-10pc}[0pc][0pc]{\includegraphics{FILE}}}
\fancyfoot{}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}
\renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0pt}

\begin{document}
\pagestyle{fancy}

Testing to see if this text will overrun the picture included in the  
header. It works!

\end{document}

Alternatively, you can investigate the wallpaper package:
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/wallpaper.html

There're some interesting alternatives for this such as psfrag or  
WarmReader/Illustrator Marked Objects plug-in also xy-pic and overpic  
I believe.

Diego,

There are two solutions depending on what you want to do.

If you want to add some text or whatever to a latex figure then I use
the overpic package, which is basically:

\begin{overpic}[<graphicx options]{<graphic file>}{
 latex picture commands \put, etc. 
\end{overpic}

The graphicx options are all those you would use for \includegraphics
plus a grid option, which turns on a grid to help you see where to put
your extra bits. I think this is what you're after, and it is very easy.
It's essentially an extended version of \includegraphics.

If you want to place something on a page, such as a watermark, I'd use
eso-pic. There are some examples with the package/documentation.

HTH

Steve

Picture.... hmmm...

No, that is how you get a floating "figure" object that makes room
for itself automatically where it will fit.

Watch out for those control-characters you are randomly inserting.
Yes, you get an image using \includegraphics.

The picture environment is the official (but clumsy) way to 
overlay various pieces.

If you just want the image to occupy zero space, then you can put 
(\put) it in a zero-zise picture environment or use:
\smash{\makebox[0pt][l]{\includegraphics { }}}

If you want a background image for the page, see the (UKTug) TeX FAQ,
and use a package (likely eso-pic).

The best way is to use Rolf's overpic package.  
 
  http://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/overpic/

It does exactly what you propose but has some options which make life
easier.  Unfortunately I don't find any documentation on CTAN but I
remember an article in the newsletter of DANTE, the German TeX user
group, some time ago.  As far as I remember it is more convenient than
using the picture environment directly.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The link above fails, but typing overpic into the search keyword will
lead you to:

opic-rel.tex and
opci-abs.tex

which are the 2 examples and show (presumably) all the possibilities,
and are simplicity in themselves (and not much more than what I already
posted!)

Thanks for the link.  I think that Figure 3 makes clear what I mean
when I say it's more convenient than using the LaTeX picture
environment directly.

Message-ID: <200705232253.l4NMrtl30787@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

- Thanks to everyone who has joined or renewed their TUG membership for
  2007.  If you haven't already, we sure hope you'll consider it!  The
  early bird membership discount ends May 31, so join today :).
  

- The latest subjects in the Interview Corner are David Fuchs, one of
  the original members of the Stanford TeX project, and Jin-Hwan Cho,
  maintainer of dvipdfmx and a strong supporter of TeX in Korea.
  http://tug.org/interviews/


- TUG 2007 will be held in San Diego, California, July 17-20, 2007, on
  the campus of San Diego State University.
  http://tug.org/tug2007/
  
  The web site has a registration form and other information.  We extend
  an early bird discount to those registering before May 31.  Hope to
  see you in San Diego!
  https://www.tug.org/tug2007/register.html


The most exceptional news we have is about funding for TeX development.
We are very excited and grateful to be able to announce that an
anonymous foundation has just contributed $10,000 to TUG to be used to
encourage significant advances in TeX development.

Furthermore, our generous donor has made a second $10,000 available as
matching funds, and therefore we are seeking other contributors, both
institutional or individual, to contribute a matching $10,000 (thus
reaching a total of $30,000).  Early matching contributions have already
passed $3,000 -- we thank CAPDM Limited and other donors for their
support.  To contribute, please see the information and form at
https://www.tug.org/donate/dev.html.

These amounts of money are not sufficient to fund significant new
activities (for instance, we cannot hire full-time programmers).  Thus,
we expect to use at least some of these funds to augment existing
efforts, rather than starting anything major from scratch.

The TeX Development committee of TUG will have responsibility for
allocating these funds.  As part of the gift, we were asked to develop a
basic roadmap for future TeX development to help guide where the
contributions are spent.  The committee has already solicited input from
some of the major extant TeX development projects, and will be
soliciting additional input.

At the donor's suggestion, we will also be considering ways to improve
the TeX experience specifically for "ordinary" users, such as students.
This could include enhancements in front end software, new or improved
documentation at that level, and other projects.

We are enthusiastic about the opportunity we've been provided, and very
much hope, as does our donor, that the results will be beneficial for
all TeX users.


Best wishes,
Karl Berry (President) on behalf of the TUG Board

Hi all,

hmmm, I have a standard preamble including Latin Modern...

%\usepackage[answerdelayed]{exercise}
\usepackage{calc}
\usepackage{makeidx}
%\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\usepackage{lmodern}

\begin{Verbatim}

    contenttype( "text/plain" );

    print( "Hello, world!" );
}
\end{Verbatim}

---

...the output appears skewiff. Opening curly braces appear as
hyphen-like characters, closing curly braces are like double quote
characters. Other ``special'' characters like open and closing angle
brackets appear funny, too.

Presumably this is an encoding issue? If so, I can fix it with an
optional argument in the \usepackage directive, right?

Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,

Hi!
A solution can be found on that site:
http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/latex/packages/index.html#quotepas
 I'm looking for a way to automatically cite parts of
books divided into chapters and verses (e.g. antic
texts, the bible...). The idea would be to have a
command as \write{the_republic6.1}, and the result
would be to write down the first paragraph of the
sixth chapter of "The republic". Has anybody written a
code for that?

Subject: [texhax] Combining tex & latex
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0705250056110.25505@CSOPT3.wpi.edu>


Dear All,

   Here is an issue I do not believe I have seen addressed here.

A colleague and I are beginning to write a book.  Each will be writing 
some parts.  He is writing in tex, and is not interested in learning new 
tricks (though I have not given up) and I use latex, and would rather not 
lose the convenience and power.

How can I combine chapters done in these manners into a single document? 
I would not mind doing some processing, but it needs to involve 
relatively little manual work, as we expect /everything/ to be revised 
many, many times as the book evolves.


Thanks for any leads,

--Micha Hofri

is there any reasonable way to discover which entries were rejected---

I'm not really sure about this, but I suspect that rejection refers to
situations where an item has duplicate entries on the same output page and
therefore the extras are "rejected".

There's a log file produced by  makeindex  where you can find things  
out.  I don't remember its extension, but it starts with "i";  maybe   
".ilg"?

I suspect the error must be something else.  In my recent uses of 
makeindex, it had no difficulty simplifying multiple references on one 
page to a single reference.  None of these instances generated the 
rejection message.  My experience is that "rejected" refers to a 
malformed entry.

I've never done this myself, but there are several packages to make a
glossary, please have a look at:

  http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/bytopic.html#index

Please note that the glossary package has recently been declared
obsolete by its author Nicola Talbot. It's successor is called
glossaries. All download information and more can be found in the TeX
Catalogue.

Subject: [texhax] Low-level TeX question: string substitution macro
Message-ID: <465C2CDF.3040305@cantab.net>


I'm trying to write an internal macro that does string substitution, in
order to escape certain characters in the string before writing it to a
file. (The package is supposed to be writing a sed script, so I need to
escape characters that have a special meaning in regular expressions.)

If this was a user-level macro to be used in the LaTeX source itself, I
think can see how it could be done, by changing the catcodes of the
characters to be escaped to 13 (active character), then defining these
active characters to expand to escaped versions of themselves. (I
suppose this would be somewhat akin to LaTeX's \verb command). The
trouble is, this macro is to be used in a LaTeX package, and I need
something like the following to work:


\begingroup%
\catcode`|=0
|catcode`.=13 |catcode`[=13 |catcode`]=13
|catcode`^=13 |catcode`$=13 %$
\catcode`\\=13
|gdef|@escapechars#1{%
   |begingroup
   |catcode`|=0
   |catcode`.=13 |catcode`[=13 |catcode`]=13
   |catcode`^=13 |catcode`$=13 %$
   |catcode`\=13
   |def\{|string\|string\}%
   |def^{|string\|string^}%
   |def${|string\|string$}%
   |def.{|string\|string.}%
   |def[{|string\|string[}%
   |def]{|string\|string]}%
   #1|endgroup%
}
|endgroup%
\def\@tmpa{\foobar}
\expandafter\@escapechars\expandafter{\@tmpa}%


It seems I need those \catcode changes outside the macro definition, as
well as inside, otherwise the |endgroup and |catcode changes inside the
macro aren't recognized properly, though I don't entirely understand the
reason behind this. In reality, the \@tmpa macro is of course defined by 
a much more complicated process than a simple \def (otherwise the whole 
exercise becomes trivial!), but the above serves to illustrate the scenario.

This code is supposed to change the "\foobar" into "\\foobar", but 
instead it fails with an "Undefined control sequence \foobar" error. If 
I understand this correctly (unlikely!), the problem is that the "\" in 
"\foobar" already has catcode 0 (escape character) before it's absorbed 
by \@escapechars, so TeX expands #1 into "\foobar" with the catcodes 
already assigned, the catcode changes inside the \@escapechars macro 
have no effect, and TeX tries to interpret "\foobar" as a command 
sequence. Is this at all correct?

Is there any way to do what I want? If my above analysis is correct,
what I guess I need is a command to change the catcodes of tokens, but
TeX's abilities in this respect seem to be limited. The \string and
\meaning commands can only change tokens to catcode 12 (letter), and the
\lowercase command changes charcodes rather than catcodes. Maybe there's 
a completely different way of achieving what I want?

I've tried to reduce this question to its bare essentials, but if it's
not clear what I'm trying to do, I can go into more detail.

Thanks very much,

Toby

Can't sed do this itself? I'm almost afraid to mention this, but
perl has a builtin function called quotemeta which does exactly what you
want. Please, please, please, no language wars. It's just a possible
option for Tony.

In two passes, obviously yes. (Pass the sed script itself through a 
simple sed command to escape the chars, then run the escaped script). 
I'd be OK with this for my own personal use, but it's a bit ugly in a 
package that may be used by others.

Originally, I assumed there must be an easy way to get sed to do a 
simple substitution of one sequence of characters by another, without 
any regexp processing. Then it occurred to me that in all my years of 
using sed, I'd never needed to do this (because I could always just 
escape the special characters manually in the regexp). Having read the 
sed man pages again, it seems there's no sed command that does simple 
substitution (unless I'm missing something obvious - always possible!).


> I'm almost afraid to mention this, but

Thanks for that. I guess I could use perl instead (I'd have to learn it 
first!). But sed is probably slightly more widespread than perl. I'm not 
fixated on sed though. Maybe it would be simpler in awk, or perhaps even 
m4 would be able to do it!? (Not sure I want to go there - coding m4 is 
probably an even bigger brainf*ck than TeX!)

Still, it feels like TeX should be able to do what I want. After all, it 
is a macro language designed specifically for processing text...

Message-ID: <alpine.LFD.0.98.0705291716370.15449@seagull.bpi.cam.ac.uk>


Dear All,

I sometimes use NatBib-based bibliography styles to get author/year
citations.  But I also sometimes read books that have more than one
edition, and like to capture the first-edition year as well as the
year of the edition I'm actually citing, e.g.:

@BOOK{Jeffreys:1961:TP,
author="Harold Jeffreys",
editor="N. F. Mott and E. C. Bullard and D. H. Wilkinson",
title="Theory of Probability",
publisher="Clarendon Press",
year="1961 (1939)",
address="Oxford",
edition="Third",
series="The International Series of Monographs on Physics"
}

I also sometimes read works by authors who've changed their surname
between two reprints of a work, and like to keep track of that as
well, e.g.

@INCOLLECTION{Lewis:1995:D,
editor="John G. Noyes and Jim Asher and Owen C. Jones and Geoffrey
F. Phillips",
booktitle="{K}aye {\&} {L}aby: Tables of Physical and Chemical
Constants",
publisher="Longman",
year="1995 (1911)",
address="Harlow",
edition="Sixteenth",
author="Lewis[ Peggs], S[ylvia] L.",
title="Densities",
chapter="2.2.1",
pages="41--43",
note="{URL}:
$\langle{}$\url{http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/general_physics/2_2/2_2_1.html}$\rangle{}$"
}

The trouble is, bibliography entries with either the multiple year
field or the multi-surname author field confuse NatBib and its
descendants, so that they revert to numeric citations.  So, any ideas
how I can get author/year citations _and_ keep this sort of
non-standard author and year information in the reference list,
please?

This will work with a slight modification as given below:

|gdef|@escapechars{%
%   |begingroup
   |catcode`|=0
   |catcode`.=13 |catcode`[=13 |catcode`]=13
   |catcode`^=13 |catcode`$=13 %$
   |catcode`\=13
   |def\{|string\|string\}%
   |def^{|string\|string^}%
   |def${|string\|string$}%
   |def.{|string\|string.}%
   |def[{|string\|string[}%
   |def]{|string\|string]}%
%   #1|endgroup%

|endgroup%

{\tt\@escapechars \foobar ^FOO $foo}

Have you tried to search for your answer on the web?  It often helps

Try looking at XeTeX.  This is a unicode version of Tex and LaTeX that
supports alphabets besides the Latin and languages beside the European
very well.

This is exactly what I meant by "if this was a user-level macro to be 
used in the LaTeX source itself, I think can see how it could be done". 
If you replace the final line by:

\def\@tmpa{\foobar ^FOO $foo}
{\expandafter\@escapechars\@tmpa}

then it fails with the "undefined control sequence \foobar" error, as 
before. The point is that the string containing the characters I need to 
escape is stored in a macro, *not* entered manually in the LaTeX source.

Thanks for taking the time to reply though,

Toby

Well, I don't' have any problems with the first citation entry above but the
second is bound to cause problems: the use of explicit square brackets
inside an optional argument would send any LaTeX command haywire.  Try using
\lbrack and \rbrack instead.

I really don't know if it works fine with MikTeX, as I use Mac. I  
know it works with W32TeX ( http://www.fsci.fuk.kindai.ac.jp/kakuto/ 
win32-ptex/web2c75-e.html ) and that TeXLive2007 comes with XeTeX.

You do not have strings or characters in "internal" macros; you
have tokens.  Some input characters give no tokens. 

In general, you can't write all characters using TeX, because it converts
to ^^ notation.  TeX only writes files for itself to reload; it is not
for general writing.

This is the *only* way to capture all input characters.

Catcodes control how characters are read from input, and contribute tokens 
to the internal workings.  Note that in "\foobar" there is only one
token, and there is certainly no backslash character:

\escapechar=44
\string\foobar

> In reality, the \@tmpa macro is of course defined by a

Attempt:
\write{\expandafter\strip at prefix\meaning\@tmpa}

That gives a sanitised string representation, what TeX uses for
error messages, but it is not a duplicate of the input characters.

You should really be using an external string processing language.

Since XeTeX is quite new, I assume that the latest MikTeX release is
required.

Thank you very much Philip, that helped a lot.  NatBib is now
producing author/year citations, as I wanted.  Two problems remained:

Firstly, for a multi-year entry like year="1995 (1911)", the final
output didn't close the brackets: i.e. I see [McGlashan, 1995 (1911],
when I'd like to see [McGlashan, 1995 (1911)].  That was easily fixed
by enclosing the brackets in braces: year="1995 {(}1911{)}".

Secondly, if I have, for example, two bibliography entries such that
\citep{McGlashan:1995:PS},\citep{McGlashan:1995:CT} produces
[McGlashan, 1995 (1911)b],[McGlashan, 1995 (1911)a], then I'd like
\citep{McGlashan:1995:PS,McGlashan:1995:CT} to produce [McGlashan,
1995 (1911)b,a], but instead, it produces [McGlashan, 1995 (1911)b,(].
That one's got me stumped.  Any ideas, please?

You probably want the slashed package.

Here is a Feynman character: $\slashed{k}$.

On the fist point, again the presence of ( and ) confuses natbib; you could
use something like \def\lparen{(} and \rparen.

On the second, I find that my personal (highly personalised bst's) work
where natbib doesn't.  However, if I enclose the entire date in an extra set
of braces {} then, on runnng LaTeX, I get a string of errors, but ... the
output is correct.

Sorry, I haven't got time right now to go into this deeper.

Subject: [texhax] chess fonts using TeX, MiKTeX, and WinEdt,
Message-ID: <137334.47219.qm@web32710.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I want to find some chess fonts that will permit me to
publish chess position (ie with the board and the
pieces on them).

I am not a very sophisticated MiKTeX or WinEdt user
and do not use LaTeX.  

Does anyone know of Chess font package targeted toward
TeX (and not LaTex) then is easily installable and let
me use MiKTeX through WinEdt (and can walk me through
the process)?

Thanks a lot, 

Les

Hello all TEX users

I'm a Mongolian and working at Civil Aviation. I'm sorry if I wrote this e-mail with error. I have a problem with fonts. I need use arial (arialmon) font for my thesis. My boss didn't really agree with times new roman. But I can't use arialmon. I use WinEdt5.3 and Miktex 2.1. So my question is a How to use ARIAL in LATEX, MIKTEX.

I sent you my thesis for your help

I am looking forward to receving any good news from you.

With the deepest appreciation,

B. Tuguldur

I had the same problem when I used my own version of an eplain 
indexing macro instead of the standard one used in Context. Extra 
space was spotted by the customer which was emabarassing. My solution 
was to revert to the less-powerful Context version.  The extra space 
disappeared but so did the "see also" etc. 

I'll remember the % trick.

Assuming the original for which Arial was matched would be okay, you  
should be able to get away with something like:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{helvet}                     %Add this line
\renewcommand\familydefault{\sfdefault} %and this one
\begin{document}
Test
\end{document}

If you have math, you'll also need to add \usepackage{sansmath} (you  
can download sansmath.sty from your local CTAN node if need be) and  
you may need to adjust your input and font encodings to facilitate it  
working properly.

Subject: [texhax] Low-level TeX question: string substitution macro
In-Reply-To: <465C2CDF.3040305@cantab.net>
References: <465C2CDF.3040305@cantab.net>
Message-ID: <465F1263.8060505@dr-qubit.org>


Thanks to some very helpful comments from Barbara Beeton (off-list) and 
to the on-list replies, I've now more or less got this working.

Since catcodes are fixed when the characters are first read (apart from 
special commands like \string and \meaning), it seems there's no way to 
do what I want directly. So instead, I first write the unescaped text to 
a temporary file, then modify the appropriate catcodes and re-read this 
temporary file, writing it out again to the final destination file. The 
modified catcodes are in effect when the file is re-read, so the 
characters get expanded to their escaped form when they're re-written.

The only thing holding me back from dispensing with the temporary file 
is that I can't figure out how to write a newline character to an 
external file. None of the following seem to work:

\write\@stream{^^M}
\write\@stream{\\}
{\lccode`|=13 \lowercase{\write\@stream{|}}}

Is there some way to write out an explicit newline? Please don't just 
tell me I could do it by writing the file one line at a time. That's 
what I'm doing at the moment, but it requires the temporary file. I have 
to loop through the temporary file, reading a line from it and 
immediately re-writing it (with escapes expanded) to the final file. I 
could store the text to be written in a macro that gets added to each 
iteration, and write it all out to file at the very end. But then I need 
to insert the newlines manually into the macro so that they appear in 
the file when it's written out, hence my question.


In answer to Donald Arseneau's comments: I realise TeX's file 
input/output features aren't designed for dealing with anything other 
than files containing TeX source. But the file I'm writing *is* mostly 
TeX code. The sed script contains rules for replacing one sequence of 
LaTeX commands with another. The LaTeX commands to be replaced aren't 
known until the LaTeX source file is processed, so I *have* to write out 
at least some of the information from within TeX. Given that I have to 
write something from TeX, I might as well write the entire sed script 
from TeX if I can.

Finally, in reply to Michael Doob: I now think that writing a Perl 
script instead of sed would only make things slightly simpler. I would 
still need to escape the "\" character inside Perl strings when writing 
the script file from TeX, and we're back to my original problem :) By 
the way, awk can also be made to escape special characters in a string 
prior to using it as a computed regexp, though not in quite so simple a 
way as Perl. But I seem to have it working with sed now, anyway.

Thanks for everyone's help, and I hope someone can shed similar light on 
my final dilemma.

In

     http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/chess/

the subdirectories except bdfchess may help you,
especially chess, enpassant, and skak. Perhaps even chessfss,
since there is a Plain TeX version of the New Font Selection Scheme.
The MiKTeX package chess and perhaps chessfss as well may provide
the fonts and macros.

     http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/chesstools/

contains to ZIPs whose content I don't know.

I found this by entering "chess" at

     http://tug.ctan.org/search.html

My own use of MiKTeX is experimental, and I never have worked with WinEdt.

Good luck,

   Uwe.

Sorry that I don't read the whole thread.
(A local philosopher here in Munich has said that you must decide
between being a reading or a writing philosopher.)

I have started working on a package or bundle on this matter
months ago, result attached.

I want to extend this to make up for my difficulties with Perl and AWK,
also to have an easily portable substitute for them.
The basic idea is the philosophy of docstrip, the goal to generalize
the latter very much. I thought of making a CTAN subdirectory "parse"
too which many could contribute special matching macros.
What I want to have first are macros for extracting version informations
from my own packages foo.sty without \usepackage{foo} etc.
Especially, look for \def\filedate and \ProvidesPackage and check
whether the date is the same as the latest date in the versions history.
Using, alas, the platform's files listing (dir; ls), check whether the
date of the most recent "physical" change of the file is documented
inside the file. I also have numerous versions of certain packages of my own
on numerous computers in numerous directories of each and want
to see where the most recent versions are.

Unfortunately, I became too busy with the German Wikipedia in recent months.

Cheers,

   Uwe.
