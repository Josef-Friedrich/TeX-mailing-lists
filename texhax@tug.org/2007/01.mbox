Don't the usual tricks work?  All of the following seem to do it:

\uppercase{m\null}. m

\uppercase{m}\null. m

\uppercase{M\null}. m

\uppercase{M}\null. m

Except the last two also produce end-of-sentence spaces.  What I'd
like is a macro that will expand
    \newuppercase{M}. foo
to
    M. foo
and
    \newuppercase{m}. bar
to
    M at . bar
i.e., I want the end-of-sentence algorithm to see the original case of
the letter inside the macro argument, not the upper case it's been
forced to.

This is now more curiosity than practical need; the \introduce macro
in ScriptTeX will not often be called with an acronym and so the \null
trick looks like The Right Thing? for now.

I see now.  Then what you need is to get the space factor of the last
letter in the argument of \uppercase.  Something like this:

------------------------------%<------------------------------
\def\uc#1{%
  \setbox0=\hbox{#1\xdef\ucsf{\spacefactor\the\spacefactor}}%
  \uppercase{#1}\ucsf
}%

\uppercase{m}. m\par
\uc{m}. m\par

\bigskip

\uppercase{M}. m\par
\uc{M}. m\par

\bye

Hmm. I'd have thoought either a simple eqnarray or using the array
package would do what you want, unless I'm missing the point. See the
appended code.

This very nearly works, but now it eats the space following the macro argument:
    \uc{foo} bar
typesets as
    FOObar
Can a \makeeatletter somewhere fix this?

Sorry, this is my fault -- the space is eaten after the assignment
inside \ucsf.  Just add \relax after the assignment, and everything
should be ok:

\def\uc#1{%
  \setbox0=\hbox{#1\xdef\ucsf{\spacefactor\the\spacefactor\relax}}%
  \uppercase{#1}\ucsf
}%

The eqnarray is probably not the best solution because it inserts more
space at the tabulators than usually desired.

AMS-LaTeX provides better solutions.  I always recommend to look into
the AMS-LaTeX manual before typesetting math formulas.  It does not
cost much time because while browsing the examples you'll find very
fast what you need.  AMS-LaTeX provides so many things which cannot be
done easily in standard LaTeX, hence it is always worthwhile to look
into its manual.

The manual is called amsldoc.pdf or amsldoc.dvi and should be shipped
with any TeX distribution.  You'll find it in the doc directory.

It's on CTAN too, of course:

 http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/amsldoc.pdf

Thanks for your suggestions, Steve.  Please don't regard this mail as
criticism, I just can't resist to point people to the AMS-LaTeX manual.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Message-ID: <459AB0CF.9070706@binghamton.edu>

Hello,

    I am currently running WinEdt/MiKTex.  I have to use some of my own 
style files.  I was wondering if there is a default place that Miktex 
looks for style files so I can just put the ones I use there instead of 
creating multiple copies in different folders for the different 
documents I write.  I tried using the package manager and this is very 
helpful except whenever I use it, it asks me to install a package called 
'latex2html'  and this then creates links within my document for all 
references I make.  I also would like to disable this and can't seem to 
figure out how to do that either.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

This is what the ``localtexmf'' tree is for.

Here's a page which discusses this in a miktex context:

http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/miktex-install.htm

Here's the proper (I hope!) FAQ page on this:

Not sure what's happening here. I think this falls under the ``Don't  
do that'' line of medical advice.

Try describing exactly which steps you take w/ which tools and what

The same with bookmarks

Any ideas what gone wrong and how regularly (i.e. without editing .aux
file before final run) fix it?

Thanks! Victor

Just a thought: did you run it through LaTeX enough times?  The page numbers
often change dramatically between one run and another but this is only
reflected in subsequent toc inputs.

Greetings,

    I'm a mongolian TeX user. 

Wow!

    And I wish to add mongolian language files to LaTeX and Babel
    system. Then I've attached these files.

Neat.

One thing is that you should explicitly state the license of the new
files.  Nothing can be assumed these days.  For these files, I recommend
the LaTeX Project Public License.

Also, hyphenation patterns for Mongolian already exist.  I am not
competent to compare.  Can you check yours against those at
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hyphenation/mnhyphen.tex?

Also, your hyphenation patterns use some binary encoding.  I don't know
what it is.  Can you convert the patterns to use only visible ASCII
characters?  You can use the TeX ^^ab notation to refer to character ab
(hex).

As for Babel, other support packages for Mongolian have been created.
See http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/mongolian.  I am not sure
if any of them have Babel support, and if so, how it differs from yours.
Can you check?

Best wishes,
Karl

Subject: [texhax] January 2007 TUG news: journals, software, conferences,
	elections
Message-ID: <200701081700.l08H0E216113@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

Some TeX and TUG news looking back on 2006 and forward to 2007.

- Journals:
  TUGboat 27:2, the TUG 2006 proceedings, is in the holiday mail and
  should be delivered soon, if not already.  It is also available online
  to members at https://www.tug.org/members/TUGboat/tb27-2.  This marks
  the completion of the 2006 publications, all mailed during 2006.  We
  are happy to be on schedule, and plan to stay that way -- the first
  issue for 2007 is already in the pipeline.
  
  Issue 2006-4 of The PracTeX Journal was also published recently,
  with an introduction to MetaPost, a review of notable LaTeX resources,
  an article on creating your own document class, and much more.
  http://tug.org/pracjourn/
  

- Software:
  We expect the next software release, tentatively named TeX Collection
  2006-07, to include new versions of MacTeX for MacOSX and proTeXt for
  Windows, as well as the cross-platform TeX Live and a snapshot of the
  CTAN archives.
  http://tug.org/texcollection/
  
  TeX Live is currently in the final stages of building and testing on
  the plethora of supported platforms.  At this time, we expect the
  overall TeX Collection to be available in February 2007.  It will be
  shipped on DVD and CD to all 2006 members.  New members for 2007 will
  receive the DVD and can optionally choose to receive CD's.
  
  The TeX Collection is a massive effort, done entirely by volunteers.
  We are profoundly grateful to the hundreds of people involved, from
  all parts of the TeX world: the contributors uploading new packages to
  CTAN, the CTAN maintainers for providing a central repository to draw
  from, the people building the binaries on a wide variety of platforms,
  those doing testing and verification of the test versions (available
  now), the developers maintaining and enhancing the software upon which
  it all rests, and the user group members keeping the infrastructure
  provided by TUG and all the TeX user groups viable by their support.
  Thank you all.


- Conferences:
  The first international ConTeXt conference will take
  place in Epen, The Netherlands, on March 24-25, 2007.
  http://context.aanhet.net/epen2007/
  
  EuroBachoTeX 2007 will be held in Bachotek, Poland,
  April 28 to May 2, 2007.
  http://www.gust.org.pl/conferences/EuroBachoTeX2007/
  
  TUG 2007 will be held in San Diego, California, July 17-20, 2007.
  The theme of TUG'07 is "Practicing TeX", and we want to encourage
  practical presentations of the sort given at the Practical TeX
  conferences the last few years.  (There will be no separate PracTeX
  conference in the USA in 2007.)
  http://tug.org/tug2007/
  

- TUG election: as mentioned previously, 2007 is an election year for TUG.
  The positions of TUG President and several members of the TUG Board of
  Directors will be open as of the TUG 2007 Annual Meeting.  The
  election to choose the new president and board members will be held in
  the spring of 2007.  Nominations for these openings are now invited;
  the deadline to receive nominations is 1 February 2007.
  Please see http://tug.org/election/ for information and forms.


- Organizationally, we are happy to report that TUG finished 2006 in
  stable financial condition -- membership from the previous year has
  held steady.  Membership fees will remain the same for 2007, and the
  TUG board has approved a budget for 2007 allocating additional funds
  to TeX projects.  If you haven't already, we sincerely hope you will
  consider joining or renewing your membership in TUG or any other TeX
  user group.  If you have renewed, we are very appreciative.  Your
  support strengthens the TeX community and keeps the user groups
  viable.  The 2007 TUG renewal forms are available at
  http://www.tug.org/join.html.


Best wishes for 2007,
Karl Berry (President) on behalf of the TUG Board

OK.
Then, is there a way to redirect them to be written somewhere else?
(While I'm asking, I guess that would be interesting to know for the  
typeset output as well.)

or maybe

$ ln -s /dev/null xx.log
$ pdftex xx > /dev/null

then it's quiet and the log goes into /dev/null (but what would that be
good for?)

Is your problen that the logfile is vast, and you need the space?  
Else why can't you just discard it once it has been made?

On Unix-like systems you might (before running LaTeX) make the logfile a
symbolic link to /dev/null, as in

ln -sf /dev/null myfile.log; latex myfile

I just tried it, and my log disappeared into the void, as desired.

Here's another solution.

I've found that you can delete the log file once
tex has started, and that doing this causes no
problems.

Of course this works on Unix - the inode is only deleted after the
creating process has closed it. But it's direntry is already deleted.

Dear Sirs,

I am writing a book in Hebrew, using TeX--XeT and am trying to typeset
in two columns. The same procedure that works in usual English files in 
TeX produces the the columns reversed, that is the first one appears on 
the left while the second appears on the right.

Do you know of a package/macros for multi-column printing for 
right-to-left editing?

My sincere thanks, Yanir Rubinstein

While I'm not aware of a package for this, an ugly hack comes to mind  
--- typesetting into a mirror-imaged box which contains the two  
columns each of which is also mirror-imaged. Perhaps you could modify  
the output routine to accommodate this?

Possibly such a hack could be applied to the multicol package or to  
LaTeX itself.

Message-ID: <bd07447b0701101246w3bf83ba1g76fa78a3e02abdd0@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all.

I am writing a text, and I use the hyperlink package (and pdflatex).
In the TOC, the link to the "References" section does not point to the
correct page (in this case, the last one of the file), but to the page
where the last section (or subsection) before the references starts.
Has anyone seen this before?

thanks

Carlos

I don't see why, it's quite clear in what it tries explain - perhaps it's
just not relevant to your problem.  But then you might be advised to try
reading the relevant section of one of the many useful guides (e.g., "The
Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2?" = lshort.dvi).

The problem is usually to do with placement of the \label{} command.
Obviously, it must be placed INSIDE the relevant environment, but, less
known, it must come AFTER the \caption command (often it is suggested to
place it inside the \caption argument (though this is not strictly
necessary). The point is that it is the \caption command that triggers the
new number.

Of course, I'm just guessing and as usual, it would have been much better to
include a small example of what you're doing in the posting.

Thank you for this Martin.  I've used this trick on
Unix.  So it seems that the log file is being written,
and so occupies space on disk.

I've just tried the same trick on Windows, and it
seems to work.

As you may know, I'm interested in running TeX as
a daemon, and so am interested in the input/output
behaviour of TeX, and in these sort of tricks.

One trick I now use (in Unix systems) is to call a script that
generates dates like this:

2007Jan11.08:53:24

which I call a 'tomdate' for some odd reason ;-)

ftp://ftp.ncifcrf.gov/pub/delila/tomdate

Then I attach to that the name of the user with `whoami`.  Usually a
particular user does not run a script more often than one per second. 
So this combination, along with the name of the script, can be used as
the name of a directory in /tmp, which exists on all Unix systems
(Mac, Linux, Sun, probably cygwin etc).  That gives one a file or
directory to work in that will be removed when the machine is
rebooted.  Then cleaning up files is somewhat optional and can be done
once the script is completely debugged.

For example:

set t1 = /tmp/`whoami`.`tomdate`.1.petals
set t2 = /tmp/`whoami`.`tomdate`.2.petals
set t3 = /tmp/`whoami`.`tomdate`.3.petals

Then the script can use any of the three names $t1, $t2 or $t3 for
storage.

I take this back to texhax. Even if it is about problems that typically occur
in critical editions, the people who know how to solve the problems may not
read a list that focusses on critical editions. (Moreover, this may be a 
weapon
to get through Pierre's spam filter.)

I am just thinking of two kinds of problems that I had in a current project:

1.) Marginal notes on the wrong side. A manual page break helps
locally. (I use a variant of \pagebreak that warns in case by some
changes of the text the manual pagebreak becomes nonsensical.)
Page 3 of

     CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/marginnote/marginnote.pdf

alludes to the problem. That marginnote package may be a remedy.
It's disadvantage is that it overlays marginal material when it comes
from the same line.

2) Marks work wrong, e.g., the heading of the next section
appears in the header of page x while the next section starts
on page x, even when I attach the \markright to the first
paragraph of the text of the next section. (Thus it even happens
if I do the things properly to which the citation above alludes.)
A manual page break helps again.

I mention these because they might occur in things
like page 2 of

     http://angiolello.net/ANG-trans.pdf

(only today I were curious enough to try some other links on
http://angiolello than those days ago) -- is my guess correct,
Pierre?

The first problem seems to be a known problem with the
LaTeX output routine. I suppose the second problem is
just another symptom of the same problem with the
LaTeX output routine (I haven't taken the time to look
for this in the LaTeX bugs database.) I have studied
parts of the output routine, but I haven't analyzed the
things I'm mentioning. I am afraid that there is no better
help than what I told above -- until LaTeX3 appears!

Concerning that proposed mailing list: the problem with
marginals may be experienced with juridical things as well,
I guess (at least with German).

Only after seeing ANG-trans.pdf and ANG-text.pdf I have
understood Pierre's posting. I have never seen this style.
No wonder, I haven't studied history or classics,
What I know about styles of critical editions is
what I have seen when working with people who
did the "critical" part of the project (I just do the
TeX-related things).

  Cheers,

   Uwe.

Hi

I want to insert a hundred lines of code to my Latex file, and add number
list before each line of code as

001  *****************

002  *******************

003  ************

.

.

.

120  ***************

 

I know 

\begin{enumerate}

            \item 

\end{enumerate}

Could add number listing to the document, but that need to add

\begin{verbatim}

 

\end{verbatim}

Code environment after each \item

 

So is there any easy way to add number listing before each line of code?

 

Thank you !

Dear users, 
Kindly help this beginner. 

Problem: Reference page is empty after compiling. But references have been captured.

Explanation:
My ".bib" file has a lot of entries. My ".bbl" files does not receive entries from my ".bib" file. In the master file where all the sub-files are called, I have the call: 

\bibliography{thesisrefs}

where thesisrefs is a  thesisrefs.bib file wherein I capture my references (bibliography). I use "WinEdit - Insert - BibTexItems" to capture my refs.

Kindly assist.

Hello. About the link to the references section pointing to the wrong
page, I found that in another latex-made pdf I downloaded, so this
might be a bug.

One possible workaround I came to is to crate a section called
"references" and then set \refname{}, like this:

\renewcommand{\refname}{}
\section{References}
\bibliographystyle{bib/apalike}
\begin{footnotesize}\bibliography{/home/foo/bib/references}\end{footnotesize}

What order did you run latex and bibtex in?  The usual sequence would
be

latex masterfile.tex	[possibly several times to get cross-references
 			right; among other things, this creates
 			masterfile.aux, which contains a summary of
 			the citations that were in masterfile.tex]

bibtex masterfile	[this uses the citation summary in
 			masterfile.aux to decide which of the entries
 			in thesisrefs.bib are relevant, and puts those
 			in masterfile.bbl]

latex masterfile.tex	[again, possibly several times; this genrates
 			the dvi file, including the references from masterfile.				bbl.]

Thanks, but the problen is, that I have no permissions to change the
input (files). I can read relatet parts (\input{}) in and typeset, but
can not insert anything or manipulate them. I think the automatet
ligatures cause the problem...

pdfTeX comes with a primitive \pdfnoligatures, which allows you to turn  
off ligatures. The microtype package provides an easy interface for it:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\DisableLigatures{encoding=T1,family=tt*}
\begin{document}
Testing \texttt{--}.
\end{document}

You'll have to give more detail; I just tried this preamble and works fine.
In particular, where do you put the \label command - it must go AFTER the
\begin{thebibliography}{} command - which is a problem if you're using
BibTeX.

I also tried it with \usepackage{tocbibind} and the pointer in the table of
contents is ok too.

Subject: [texhax] simple manuscript
Message-ID: <87bql0m9ld.fsf@gmail.com>

I have had success teaching myself Texinfo and MusiXTeX, and I now I
am trying to pick up LaTeX by typesetting my verse and cannot find
examples of the manuscript design that I am looking for. Having read
documentation and tutorials for a couple of weeks this is what I have
come up with:

\documentclass[12pt,titlepage]{article}
\author{me}
\title{poems}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\tableofcontents
\section*{apoem}
\raggedright
\baselineskip = 24pt
a line of verse\break
another line of verse\break
\pagebreak
\section*{anotherpoem}
\raggedright
\baselineskip = 24pt
a line of verse\break
another line of verse\break
\pagebreak
\end{document}

Which doesn't build a table of contents but just the heading
'Contents' at the top of the page of the first poem. I was trying to
suppress section numbering for the poems and in the table of
contents. How do I get the poems unnumbered and the table of contents
on a separate page?

Another thing I would like to accomplish is to move the page numbers
to top center.

I started to read eplain documentation when it occurred to me to ask
texhax finally.

eplain won't (directly) help w/ LaTeX.

I'd suggest using Peter Wilson's memoir documentclass which has  
excellent documentation and a verse environment.

Here's a list of free documents on (La)TeX w/ some commentary which I  
put together a while back --- lots more at www.tug.org and the links  
below (on the texhax version of this message).

Starred (*) hierarchical divisions don't appear in the table of  
contents by themselves. Below your section* you have to add:

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{apoem}


> and the table of contents on a separate page?


I don't know the article class, but I guess something like in the  
book.cls (which clear the page after Contents anyway) would work:  
after \tableofcontents

\clearpage

Again, I don't know article.cls, but I would follow William Adams  
recommendation and try memoir.cls (the manual itself is outstanding,  
as William has noted many times).

I am going to find the solution to the page numbering.

Axel, thank you for your time and hints--they led me further into the
documentation where I am finding answers. In fact, I stumbled on the
code that alphabatizes the words of a document as a step in building
an index.

One way to go is to use:

\usepackage{fancyhdr}

and then

\begin{document}

\pagestyle{fancy}
\chead{\thepage/\pageref{LastPage}}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}
\cfoot{}

Use \lhead, \chead, \rhead, \lfoot, \cfoot, \rfoot
to specify what you want at the left, centre, right
headers and footers; here \cfoot{} is used to kill
the usual page number in the \cfoot.
By default fancyhdr add a horizontal line below the
header; setting headrulewidth to 0pt removes it by
making it of zero width.
The lastpage package allows eg "page 3 of 28".

My preamble often looks like in the following example:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[applemac]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} % | These two lines make copy-paste from
\usepackage{lmodern}     % | the pdf document deal with accents ok
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\usepackage{lastpage}
\usepackage{vmargin}
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb}
\usepackage{upref}
\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{paralist}

%% Set margins
\setmarginsrb{25mm}{20mm}{25mm}{20mm}{5mm}{5mm}{0mm}{0mm}

%% No paragraph indent
\setlength\parindent{0pt}

\begin{document}

\pagestyle{fancy}
\lhead{New year resolutions}
\rhead{[2007-01-02] \thepage/\pageref{LastPage}}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}
\cfoot{}

Cette ann\'ee, ...

I've just tried it (not in TeXShop as I don't have one, sorry), and it
worked just fine.  Just a thought -- are you using a .mst file
(MakeIndex style file) with @ or $ redefined?

There is plenty of documentation, both free and non-free, just go to

  http://tug.org/begin.html

Since, as you say, you are not in a hurry and don't have any specific
needs, I strongly recommend obtaining a copy of The TeXbook (a link is
on the above page).  It's not exactly a user guide / reference and is
quite a long read, but it's a must if you want to really understand /
learn how TeX works.  But be warned that it won't help you much in
_using_ LaTeX, if that's your (only) aim -- for that, you'll need some
LaTeX book.

> Should I join TUG?

You certainly don't have to, but much of the TeX-related software and
activities are sponsored entirely by members, so please consider
joining if you like TeX and/or find it useful.

It is included in the ``TeX Collection 2005'' DVD which is included  
w/ a TUG membership (which I'd suggest) or available separately from:

http://tug.org/store/

for $50.

Sometimes there are workshops before or after conferences and there's  
lots of documentation available on-line.

I've got a list of some here:

and there's lots more at www.tug.org/begin.html

Everyone,

On a related note, how can one omit the chapter number, meanwhile 
retaining the chapter name, both in the TOC, and at the start of each 
chapter? I tried >>\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{a chapter name}<< at 
no avail. It seemingly only affects sections, and not chapters. Thanks.

Subject: [texhax] AMS fonts as text
Message-ID: <45AE2E6B.10508@kamprint.com>

Barbara Beeton at AMS suggested I write to you about a question you may 
have dealt with before -- the use of AMS fonts such as Euler (EURM 10 
and others) as text fonts.

I like them as text fonts for certain applications such as captions 
because they look italic without the undue emphasis implied by leaning 
over, and they look handwritten without the smarmy greeting-card look of 
script fonts.

The problem is that because the AMS fonts were not intended to be used 
as text fonts, the spaces between words are filled with a Greek letter. 
I would like to have the space key (or any other key or key-combination) 
write s blank space (or a non-blank space that would look blank in print).

I would guess that I am not the first person to ask this question, so 
with luck you might have a solution at hand.

I am using a Sony Vaio computer with a Windows XP (Japanese) OS. (The 
fact that it is a Japanese version of XP should not matter for this 
purpose, as it is adaptable to English input.) The fonts were downloaded 
from the AMS site, and they work perfectly well, as installed, in all 
applications, except for the Greek letter that fills the spaces I would 
like to be blank. I am not familiar with 'tex', but will learn it if 
necessary; though if there is an easy solution, say, through some 
special ASCII code, that would be best.

I would appreciate whatever assistance you might be able to provide.

With thanks and best new year wishes,

Message-ID: <45AF89F9.4070108@o2.pl>

Hi all,

I have a strange problem with bibtex + biblatex on my Linux system. The 
problem is that the charset of xyz.bbl was incorrect after running 
bibtex + biblatex.


$ tex --version
TeX 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.4)
kpathsea version 3.5.4
...

$ echo $LANG
en_US.UTF-8

$ latex xyz
# no errors

$ bibtex xyz
# no errrors

$ latex xyz
./xyz.bbl:18: Package utf8x Error: Malformed UTF-8 sequence.

$ files -i xyz*
xyz.aux: application/x-empty
xyz.bbl: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
xyz.blg: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
xyz.dvi: application/x-dvi
xyz.log: text/x-c++; charset=us-ascii
xyz.tex: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The charset of xyz.bbl should be UTF-8/us-ascii instead of ISO-5589-1.

Is there anyway to fix this  problem?

Thank you very much for replies.

Regards,


kyanh

Probably the best solution here would be a Unicode version of the font.

As a work-around until that appears, you could just just use a  
formatting-based search-replace, searching for all spaces formatted  
in the font and replacing them w/ a space from a font which provides  
the desired-size space.

Message-ID: <45B08371.40509@psych.uib.no>

I am working on converting my PowerPoint presentations to LaTex using 
the beamer class.  Although it takes more time to create a 
presentation, they look great.

However, I have problems with handouts.  One of the nice things with 
PowerPoint is that you can print out up to 6 pictures of the slides on 
the same (A4) page.  In the manual there is a pointer on how to do 
this, which involves pgfpages.  This package is not included in my 
installation, and I would very much like to know where to find that 
package, where to install it, and what dependencies on other packages 
there might be. Any pointers?

Dear responsable,
Good morning,
"excuse my bad english"
Please, I have many problems in using  \pause to have incremental page build
(i.e. the mode in which parts of the page appear incrementally when the user
clicks a mouse button or presses a key) .
I work with windowsXP +miktex2.3-winedit , pdftex version1.10b ,  but when I
compile  pauseex.tex and leveldemo.tex by pdflatex but I can not obtain the
same pages as pauseexorig.pdf and leveldemoorig.pdf ( the original pdf
obteined by pdflatex +ppower4).
I hope, please, that you help me to solve this problem.
Thanks.

I suspect you're looking for pdfpages, not pgfpages. I don't use it but
a quick glance at the documentation led me quickly to the following
document which probably does what you want:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{pdfpages}

\begin{document}

\includepdf[nup=2x3,delta=40mm
10mm,frame,landscape,pages=-,scale=0.9]{<presentation file.pdf>}

\end{document}

You don't really need to do it this way, as any printer option to put
multiple pages on a page will work. Depending on your system, you'll
find these in the print dialogs, printer setups, etc. However, as beamer
generates pages that are physically small, you need to expand them to an
appropriate size before/when you pass them to the multiple-page print
filter.

Here's an alias to a sequence of commands that I use on my linux system
to put 4 slides to a page:

alias beamer4up 'pdftops -paper match \!* - | psnup -4 -W126mm -H96mm
-b0.5cm -pa4  | ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 - \!*"4up.pdf"'

with some explanation:

1) as I use pdflatex to generate presentations, pdftops converts it to a
ps file to I can then use psnup. The -paper match option ensures that
the ps file retains the same page size as the pdf file. I use pdftops
instead of pdf2ps as I have found that it handles fonts better.

2) psnup does the work of putting multiple pages on a page (in the above
alias 4 but you can put any whole number here),  specifies the input
page size WxH, adds a border around each slide, and puts the whole thing
out on a4 paper.

3) ps2pdf then converts it back to a pdf, which is named
file.pdf4up.pdf.

The professional script-writers will easily deduce from the above that
I'm not one of them, but this works well for me. I got the basic bits
from somewhere in the beamer documentation, and the rest by trial and
error.

HTH.

Steve

pgfpages is part of the pgf bundle. You can get it from CTAN:

Message-ID: <6B0F513D-A52B-4461-89FB-376EBF2E0CA4@gmail.com>

Is there a way to send some \marginpar's to the left margin and some  
to the right, on the same page?
That is, explicitly instruct LaTeX to place a specified \marginpar to  
the left, and a specified other to the right?
As in:  be able to implement a \marginparright and a \marginparleft,  
or some such.

Note that \reversemarginpars and \normalmarginpars seem to only work  
per page.
Also note that the cute \marginpar[left text]{right text} also does  
not address this:  it gobbles one of the two texts.

Thanks,

Alex

As a matter of fact I *was* looking for pgfpages, that what it said in 
the documentation for beamer (version 3.06, page 180)  But if this 
works, fine, and thank you very much!

Subject: [texhax] More Beamer questions
Message-ID: <45B4C460.3010301@psych.uib.no>

I am beginning to get the hang of Beamer for a course that starts in a 
three weeks time, but there are (of course) a huge number of thisng to 
learn.  Here are a few:

There are a few elements in most or all of the themes for Beamer which 
I would like to eliminate from the slides.  First, if you have defined 
an author and a title for the presentation, these elements always 
appear at the top of the sidebars.  I would prefer to have this 
information on the first frame, using \maketitle.  That would save 
valuable real estate.  Is it possible to use some option like 
"\noauthor" somewhere?

The other thing which I would like to eliminate is the faint 
navigation things close to the lower right corner.  Is it possible to 
supress this part of the slide?

Tom

I agree. Maybe Markus Kohm (komascript at gmx.info) is willing
to extend his marginnote package for this purpose.

For doing it on your own, you might put the marginal text into
a \parbox and move it (in the arguments of \marginpar) it
\textwidth + 2\marginparsep + \marginparwidth to the left or right.
Whether to the left or to the right with [twoside] can be decided
by \label (using a counter for such marginals) and \pageref.
(For strange formats of pagenumbers, you can use Heiko
Oberdiek's refcount package.)
For moving, you could use the primitive TeX command \move.
For pure LaTeX only something like

     \marginpar{%
       \hspace*{\onesign<sum>}%
       \parbox{\marginparwidth}{<text>}%
       \hspace*{\othersign<sum>}}

might do, where \onesign and \othersign a macros expanding
to `-' or to nothing depending on whether the page number is
odd or even.

If you want to have "facing" marginals (marginal texts
on both sides at about the same vertical position),
Markus' approach might be better.
It doesn't move down the second \marginpar coming from the
same text line. Or you could use \raisebox in some way
(maybe manually at certain occasions only, or in a tricky
way to get it automatically -- measure the height ...)

Cheers,

   Uwe.

Well, and moreover one of \onesign and \othersign must
add or subtract \marginparwidth ... Uwe.

On the first frame you can put \titlepage to make appear author, date, 
institute.. About the \noauthor query, there is maybe such an option however 
you can customize already existing beamer themes, it is quite 
straight-forward. (See files in your latex distribution in the directory 
beamer/theme to understand how existing themes work)

You have to put this in the outer theme you use:
\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}

For beamer related questions you can use :

various representative people: Ages 23, 29, and 39 (the 25th, 50th,
and 75th percentiles), male and female, and at the three levels of
drug use. In the first figure, we see that by far the highest
predicted risk is for female IDUs.  We also see that age makes
little difference, but appears to be slightly higher in the middle
of the age range.

Figure \ref{F:logpredval} shows some different aspects of the
predicted values.  Here, it is easy to see that, for people who use
either marijuana or no drugs, sex makes very little difference in
number of partners; for users of other non-injected drugs it makes a
moderate difference, and for drug injectors it makes a very large
difference.

Peter,

>From http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=crossref and any
decent latex manual:

"Sometimes, however many times you run LaTeX, the cross-references are
just wrong. Remember that the \label command must come after the
\caption command, or be part of it."

It's the \caption that increments the figure number. I suppose if you
really didn't want the figure to have a caption you could manually
increment the figure counter. But without a caption your cross-reference
to a figure by number is pretty meaningless.

Or have I missed something? Perhaps you've been partaking too personally
in the subject of your text?!

Obviously, it must be placed INSIDE the relevant environment, but, less

Yes, that is true.  You want to be sure the presentation itself to be 
synchronized with the handouts, which means that you have to generate 
the presentation first, and then the handout.  If you forget one of 
the two after an editing of the frames, they are not synchronized 
anymore.

On the other hand, it seems to me that the \includepdf alternative is 
better in one respect, it is more flexible in respect to page numbers, 
headers on the handouts etc. (but that may be due to my inexperience). 
  So, perhaps using pdfpages is the best solution.

The problem of ensuring that things are called in the right sequence 
is simple to solve, use a .bat file with calls on pdflatex (with 
corresponding calls on bibtex etc.as needed) in the right sequence.

Yes, I agree, it is less than optimal to have to re-typeset the 
document if you already have a presentation that looks the way you 
want it, there is always the risk of introducing some errors due to 
unwanted interactions etc.. as you experienced.

As I said in the previous message, the only problem I can see with the 
pdfpages solution is synchronization, and that is not a big one.  In 
all other respects it seems to be more flexible.  A solution is to use 
what is called a .bat file in the Windows world.  That is simply a 
file with commands directly to the operating system, a script in the 
linux world.  That is a very basic feature in any operating system I 
can think of.  Make a file with two lines, the first one with the 
command "pdflatex file1.tex" to generate the presentation, and the 
second with "pdflatex file2.tex" to generate the handout with 
appropriate latex scripts in the file1.tex and file2.tex files.  Run 
the script whenever you need the two and they are always synchronized.

Subject: [texhax] Fig. instead of Figure
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.58.0701231231130.3022@titan.cfa.harvard.edu>

Hi,

I am trying to figure out how to get figure labels such as
"Fig. 3" instead of "Figure 3" (automatically).

Relevant packages that I load:

\usepackage{epsfig}
\usepackage[hang,tight]{subfigure}
\usepackage[font=footnotesize,labelfont=bf,format=hang]{caption}

I spent time with the "caption" and "subfig" documentation, but failed
to find the solution.



Cheers
Gaspar

Subject: [texhax] Problem with footers
Message-ID: <45B783CE.2080300@oato.inaf.it>

Hi, I'm trying to set up custom footers that should be 4 lines
high+separation from the body of the page.

The problem is that, when I put in the body content something like
\begin{footnotesize}INAF ? Osservatorio Astronomico di Torino, Strada
Osservatorio 20, 10025 Pino Torinese ? Torino\\
tel.\ +39 011 8101900, fax: +39 011 8101930\end{footnotesize}}

All seems to be OK, but if I add some more lines like in the following

blabla\\
blabla\\
\begin{footnotesize}INAF ? Osservatorio Astronomico di Torino, Strada
Osservatorio 20, 10025 Pino Torinese ? Torino\\
tel.\ +39 011 8101900, fax: +39 011 8101930\end{footnotesize}}

the footer content is shifted down even if I increase the parameter
\footskip.

I searched for some parameter which could help me to set directly the
height of the footer, but the only one I could find is \footheight,
which apparently is not used in LaTeX2e.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.61.0701241352320.338@dhcp-128-83-98-129.phr.utexas.edu>

(1) i have a package (xymtex, actually) it has lots of .sty, .dtx, etc. 
files.

(2) on a Mac OSX 'iInstaller' latex installation, i found 
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/tex/latex/ has a lot of latex things i 
use all the time, so i figure its the 'right' place.  -> i am uncertain 
about the significance of the other texmf directories.  the linux install 
has only one texmf.

now i'd like to check that this is *close* to right, before doing it - any 
comments appreciated :

(3) drop xymtex/ into /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/tex/latex/
(4) `texhash` (as admin) to update all ls-R

`texconfig` is not necessary for installation of one package, right?

Look for a file called texmf.cnf and read through it.  This will make much
clear about many of the texmf directories.  At least it did for me.

Texconfig calls texhash (or at least acts like it does) to update the
ls-R files.  You only need enough privilege to update the ls-R file that
is at the head of your /usr/local... tree.  If the others don't get
updated, it's no problem.

i think i get it - so on this mac, texmf.cnf says

% User texmf trees can be catered for like this...
HOMETEXMF = $HOME/Library/texmf

... and it shows up in

TEXMF={$HOMETEXMF,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFGW,!!$TEXMFTE,!!$TEXMFMAIN}

so i install /Users/joe-user/Library/texmf/xymtex/

so as joe-user when i run texhash, shouldn't it write ls-R only in 
/Users/joe-user/Library/texmf?.. b/c it didn't...

I'm afraid I may have to leave this to wiser heads than mine.  You
describe exactly the set-up on my mac, except that things are spelled
differently, and that it works.  Does joe-user suffer from some
permission deficiency?

Here's mine.  Maybe you can see a difference.

% User texmf trees can be catered for like this...
% This used to be HOMETEXMF.
TEXMFHOME = $HOME/Library/texmf

<snip>

% Now, list all the texmf trees. If you have multiple trees you can
% use shell brace notation, like this:
%   TEXMF = {$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN}
% The braces are necessary.
%
% For texconfig to work properly, TEXMFCONGIG and TEXMFVAR should be named
% explicitly and before all other trees.
TEXMF = {!!$TEXMFCONFIG,!!$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

When I run texhash:

tomfool at toms-box:release-notes$ texhash
texhash: /Users/tomfool/.texmf-config/ls-R: no write permission. Skipping...
texhash: /Users/tomfool/.texmf-var/ls-R: no write permission. Skipping...

texhash: /sw/share/texmf-local: directory not writable. Skipping...
texhash: Updating /sw/var/lib/texmf/ls-R... 
texhash: Done.

HTH, if only a tiny bit more.

I regularly use the fancy-verb package
-- which is part of the TeXLive installation -- 
to include program code in my .pdf


%preamble:
\usepackage{fancyvrb}%VerbatimInput 
\fvset{fontsize=\small%
      ,frame=single%
      ,numbers=left}%set FancyVerb defaults

\begin{document}
\VerbatimInput[label=program part 1
              ,frame=single,numbers=left
              ,firstline=1,lastline=50]
              {program.txt}%filename.ext

\VerbatimInput[label=program part 2
              ,frame=single,numbers=left
              ,firstline=51,lastline=100]
              {program.txt}%filename.ext

to get even fancier I put the above in a minipage:

\newcommand{\EchoTextWidth}{0.94\textwidth}%

\begin{minipage}[t]{\EchoTextWidth}%line numbers are inside margin
\VerbatimInput[label=program part 3
              ,firstline=101]
              {program.txt}%filename.ext
\end{minipage}%

It's probably not in TEXMFDBS.  Since there is no "!!" in front of
$HOMETEXMF this seems to be desired.

I assume that it had been done this way because people often forget to
update the databases.  This is very reasonable because beginners will
not have many files there and searching for files in an (almost) empty
directory does not hurt.

However, the comments in texmf.cnf will help you to customize it.  But
unless you have many files in $HOME/Library/texmf it's not worth the
trouble.

Regards,
  Reinhard

that's it:

Subject: [texhax] no luck redefining \descriptionlabel to include a newline
Message-ID: <20070127152809.GA9120@lapse.madduck.net>

Dear list,

I am trying to make a description list have a new line after the
labels:

  Label   this is how it normally is, this is how it normally is,
      this is how it normally is, ...

  Label
      this is how I want it, this is how I want it, this is how
      I want it, ...

Thus I do this in the preamble:

  \makeatletter
  \renewcommand{\descriptionlabel}[1]%
    {\hspace{\labelsep}\descfont{#1}\newline}
  \makeatother

However, the newline is not happening, and neither if I use \\
instead.

I tried to do this:

  {A\hspace{\labelsep}B\descfont{#1}C{\newline}D}

and ABCD show up at the expected points in the output, so I know
that the redefinition of \descriptionlabel is actually having an
effect.

But why does it not honour the \newline?

Thanks,

Subject: [texhax] table longer than page!
Message-ID: <45BB7AF4.2080303@tin.it>

Hi All,

I have a little problem: I am adding some tables at the end of a 
document {report}, but some are longer than the page, and for some 
reason it won't continue the table in the following page, but will just 
print it till the end of the page -- and then "disappear" in the space 
in-between soaces (that is, using YAP).

any suggestions?

So far all I could do is insert an \end{tabular}, \newpage and 
\begin{tabular}, but as you may imagine it's quite ugly (and the two 
sections of the table may well have different widths now)

any suggestions?

cheers

martin

Because all the label matter is, in effect, put inside an LR-box in
which no linebreaks are allowed.

Maybe this was not a good design decision but it cannot now be changed.

Subject: [texhax] in-section references
Message-ID: <20070127195418.GA540@lapse.madduck.net>

Dear list,

I have a very complex document (a book of more than 600 pages),
which uses crossrefs a great deal. It being a book and having gone
through countless hours of scrutiny and revisions, sections have
been moved around, and I have not kept track of all the crossrefs
? after all, LaTeX should do that for me, no?

The problem I am facing now is that I end up with some crossrefs
referencing the very section in which they occur, in part because
\subsubsections are not numbered:

  \section{My section}                    % section 2

  \subsection{My subsection}              % section 2.1
  some text [...]

  \subsubsection{My subsubsection 1} \label{subsub1}
  [...] we will return to this in section \ref{subsub2} [...]

  \subsubsection{My subsubsection 2} \label{subsub2}
  [...] as discussed in section \ref{subsub1} [...]

In the final output, this will yield:

  [...] we will return to this in section 2.1 [...]
  [...] as discussed in section 2.1 [...]

Obviously, this is a bit undesirable, since both of these sentences
appear in section 2.1 themselves.

Short of making subsubsections numbered (I'd rather not deviate from
the LaTeX standards here), what are my options here? Ideally,
I would like LaTeX to realise if it's inserting a crossref to the
current section, and if that's the case, them insert a pageref
instead ("... we will return to this on page 345 ..."), or something
even more fancy ("... we will return to this later in this section
(p. 345) ...").

Is this somehow possible without having to go through the document
and verifying every single ref, because that:

$ grep -c '\ref{' *.tex
4117

is not something i'd like to do.

I have checked out the varioref package, but that's not really what
I am looking for.

Thanks a lot!

Hi Martin:

I'm afraid you will be in for some editing of references.  I make my
references look like \sectionref{subsub2} in order to deal with
situations comparable to this.  For example, I have a section that
appears in book A and booklet B.  In book A, the \sectionref{subsub2}
resolves to "Section 2.1.2" and when the same string appears in booklet
B, you get "Book A".  This way the text can read "see
\sectionref{subsub2}" and the english works with both situations.  But
you need to get the variable parts of the language inside the
\sectionref macro, which is why I think you'll need to edit.  Otherwise
you're going to have to write a macro that can erase a few words behind
it which sounds pretty hairy.

What I think you need to do is the same thing, but using a comparison
between \thesection and \ref{#1} instead of \@ifundefined.  (You'll
probably want a logical OR of three or four comparisons, between
\ref{#1}, \thechapter, \thesection and \thesubsection or
\thesubsubsection, really.)  Something like the following almost does
what you want, and perhaps you can make the conditional more elaborate
to get it exact:

\newcommand{\testref}[3]{\edef\testa{\thesection\hbox{}}%
                         \edef\testb{\ref{#1}}%
                         \ifx\testa\testb #2\else #3\fi}
\newcommand{\sectionref}[1]{\testref{#1}{This section}%
  {Section~\ref{#1}}\xspace}%

Hope this helps.

Thanks to Tom's bootstrapping help, I now whacked up the code down
below and combined it with varioref. I can now do this:

  See \vrref{section}{secA}
    would become either of:
      See section 1.2.3        (ref a different section)
      See the next page        (near ref to same section)
      See page 5               (far ref to smae section)

This works nicely. The only thing I have left to do now is to deal
with stuff like "In \vrref{section}{secB}", which could become "In
the next page". Obviously, I'd want that to be "on the next page".

The ideal but possibly also most hackish way would be to make text
figure out the word immediately before the \vrref call and to
replace in with on and In with On for in-section references. I am
not sure this is possible.

Another solution might be through the use of optional arguments,
like:

  \vrref[In][On]{section}{secA}

but I don't like this at all really.

Any ideas?

Hi list,

sorry for the flood of posts, I hope I am not being too annoying.
I did do my research and I am only turning to you guys (again)
because I was not successful.

I am looking for a package like varioref, except that it spouts
stuff like "further down" and "previously" depending on whether the
label will be or has already been encountered. In addition, it would
be nice if the package could generate stuff like "as will be shown
in section 3" vs. "as has been shown in section 3".

Do you know anything that could do this?

Cheers,

I am involved in a reprinting project and would like to have two kinds of

\dag or \ddag and would start anew on each page (it is unlikely that there 
be more than one on any page).  Is there a simple way of doing that?

Yes, the NCCtools bundle has the manyfoot package. It's excellent and  
very easy to use.

David Kastrup's

   CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/bigfoot/

is made for this.

BTW, this could have been a posting to a mailing list
for critical editions.

Good luck,

The bigfoot package I mentioned is a high-tech version of manyfoot.
I mentioned it because I thought that the original footnotes
might get editioral footnotes. Only bigfoot does this.

Peter Wilson's memoir class provides some manyfoot functionality
as well.

If you want to have the editorial notes to numbered pagewise,
while keeping the original pagenumbers which may be
chapterwise, David Kastrup's perpage may help.

For critical editions in the classical ("scholarly") style indeed,
you might visit an overview at http://ednotes.sty.de.vu.

Good luck,

Uwe L?ck.

Hi, can someone tell me how can I write 2 documents that have 90% of
the content the same, the rest 10% modified, some sections added, some
modified and some deleted?
Basically I need to write about 2 parallel developments of a product
with the same base code.

Please CC me the replies as I'm not on your list.

Vaida,

Just divide all your material into separate files (as many as you
want/need). Create two separate master documents corresponding to the
two documents you want to generate.

Then use latex's \include, \includeonly, and/or \input commands in these
to put in the specific material for each document. Note that \include
will invoke a \clearpage, and is thus used mainly for main segments
(e.g., book chapters). This is well-described in most (all?) books and
guides to latex, but to get you going here's the description from the
info tree on my (linux) system:

--------------------------------------
`\include{file}'

   The `\include' command is used in conjunction with the
`\includeonly' command for selective inclusion of files.  The `file'
argument is the first name of a file, denoting `file.tex'.  If `file'
is one the file names in the file list of the `\includeonly' command or
if there is no `\includeonly' command, the `\include' command is
equivalent to

     \clearpage \input{file} \clearpage

   except that if the file `file.tex' does not exist, then a warning
message rather than an error is produced.  If the file is not in the
file list, the `\include' command is equivalent to `\clearpage'.

   The `\include' command may not appear in the preamble or in a file
read by another `\include' command.

-----------------------------------------
`\includeonly{'file_list`}'

   The `\includeonly' command controls which files will be read in by
an `\include' command.  file_list should be a comma-separated list of
filenames. Each filename must match exactly a filename specified in a
`\include' command. This command can only appear in the preamble.

------------------------------------------
`\input{file}'

   The `\input' command causes the indicated `file' to be read and
processed, exactly as if its contents had been inserted in the current
file at that point.  The file name may be a complete file name with
extension or just a first name, in which case the file `file.tex' is
used.

Simply put the content in separate subfiles and have two main files that
\input or \include (N.B. \include starts a new page) the various subfiles as
necessary.

Alternatively to maintain just a single main file, or if you wish to
interleave pieces for one or other document inside the subfiles, put

  \newif\ifdocA

in the main files' preambles, followed by either \docAtrue or \docAfalse
accordingly.

In your subfiles you can then simply put things like:

This product is \ifdocAtrue really wonderful\else absolutely useless\fi. We
\ifdocAtrue\else cannot \fi recommend it.

You can easily get more sophisticated if need be, but this should be good
enough for starters.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

Alternatively you could use the package comment.sty, create two comments,
and enclose the version dependent stuff in the appropriate comment
environments. Then you can switch between the two versions just by
switching between include and exclude in the comment definition
(see documentation for comment.sty).

At least, this is what I do in such a case right now. I admit not having
played too much with this package yet, so I cannot tell how well it works.

Please see whether the "optional" package is of help. Documetation is 
within the optional.sty file itself.

you can also create one master document (e. g. doc.tex) for editing and
make links with different names to it (e. g. doc-a.tex and doc-b.tex (or
only doc-a.tex)):

$ ln -s doc.tex doc-a.tex
$ ln -s doc.tex doc-b.tex

Then prepare file doc.tex like the following for automatic switching
between document variants based on the document name:

\documentclass{article}

\newif\ifdocA
\expandafter\def\csname doc-a\endcsname{\docAtrue}
\expandafter\def\csname doc-b\endcsname{\docAfalse}
\csname\jobname\endcsname

\begin{document}
This is the  \ifdocA original \else alternate \fi version.
\end{document}

Message-ID: <DD2424A688ADE149879D1FE2DD5DD00E020F0789@msexchange.milgram.com>

Hi my name is Dave Bone who's been a Tug member for 4 yrs.

Currently I just purchased a Sun Ultra 20 workstation AMD flavor running
Sun's Solaris 10 Oper. Sys.

 

I am trying to get my TeX ported over to it from my TeX Collection 2005
DVD but I'm stymied as the profile of supported systems does not appear
to support the above --- Sun yes on Sparc .

 

Is there a way that I can do it?

 

Previous 2002 CD described a "build-your-own" from source approach. I
don't see it on 2005. I'm new to Unix but learning fast and am willing
to try out any suggestions.

 

Should I wait for 2007 live?

 

Sorry to bother u but I do enjoy TeXing and Cwebing. I'm porting over my
c++ multi-threaded compiler / compiler which will eventually become Tug
distributed. It is being written in Cweb that emits "pdftex" grammar
documents that includes MetaPost diagrams. For the record due to
multi-threading grammars I have broken too my compilers --- Intel, MS
Visual Studio 2005, Apple aka gnu c++. I wanted to try Sun's c++ as some
of their compiler writers came from a now defunct company Oregon
Software that created the Pascal compiler that I'm still using on the
Vax. Well my intuition paid off as so far I've only found only 1 problem
that I will get report back to them. Apart from approximately 2 days of
debugging mutex / signaling using conditional variables that was a Sun
implementation dependent detail, the port is successful. Kudos to Sun
and their c++ compiler as the others named seem to support the GNU
coding standard's recommendation to stay as close to c as one can...as
its postfix cousin has its tantrums.

 

So the last part of my port to continue my development is to get TeX /
Cweb / MetaPost installed and working.

 

I appreciate any help

Sincerely

Dave

Subject: [texhax] A question about LaTeX
Message-ID: <45C07252.7020505@telefonica.net>

Hi!

I'm a LaTeX user and I'd like to know how to do some unusual work with it:

I'm writing a program in Visual Basic for my university (University of 
Extremadura, Spain). The program is prepared to elaborate a final 
document file with the information that the user has entered in the 
program forms. Until now, this document was written in RTF format, but 
results are not really good.

I wonder if there's any executable program that, alone itself (or with a 
few more files, but without installation, if possible) can generate PDF 
files from text files written in LaTeX. For example, any "executable" 
that, with something similar to this call:

C:\...\executable.exe  LatexText.txt  PdfFile.pdf  \pdf

builds the PdfFile.pdf document with the LaTeX written text file 
LatexText.txt. If it does exists such an executable, it would be nice if 
you could give me information about it, such as:

- How can I get it.

- More or less, how does it work.

- Possible problems with the language (document will be in Spanish, so 
maybe I shall write something like "\esp" within the calling line).

- If there's any legal problem on distributing it with my program, or if 
I'll need to pay something for it.

- How should I make the reference to the product in my program (in the 
"About..." window, for example).

Lot of thanks for the help.

Luis

I believe www.pdftex.org (which aliases to http://www.tug.org/ 
applications/pdftex/ ) should answer your questions in detail.

The short version is just use pdflatex at the command prompt --- it's  
installed by most LaTeX distributions.

If the language and font access become issues you may want to try XeTeX:

http://scripts.sil.org/xetex

which also gets one to a pdf using xdvipdfmx on Windows/Linux which  
you may want to look into as well.

There are also binaries for i386-solaris, do these work?

It will not have binaries for x86_64-solaris, either. But you could
get the lastest testing image from ftp://ftp.tug.org/texlive/Images/;
it has binaries for i386-solaris. And we always welcome new
plattforms. :-)
