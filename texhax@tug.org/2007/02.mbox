Does anyone in this mailing list have experience running LaTeX or TeX in old
machine?
I just want to know how powerfull LaTeX for making document in low speed
processor, or low memory.
I'm being in process to write a book about LaTeX; in my book I want to show
that LaTeX can running well in old computer rather than word processor in
the same machine...CMIWW.
please share your experiences to me.
thanks for all of yours attention.

Well, not too long ago, I was using miktex 1.20e on an AMD 586  
@100MHz I think it was (in a Fujitsu Point 510), and now I'm using  
the latest miktex as well as w32tex on a Pentium 233MHz.

I also still occasionally use TeX on my NeXT Cube (40MHz 68040), but  
that's not been up-dated for a long while.

This is way off the purpose of this list, but I *do* use LaTeX.  In

fairly large body of text (a textbook) written in English which I want

You might check with Lance Carnes of PCTeX.  I think he started on XTs.  
I ran TeX and the UnixTeX distribution on a SUN-1 for quite a while, and 
TeXtures ran on an enhanced Macintosh Classic.  The problem would be the 
presence of enough virtual memory for all the complexity that has 
accrued in present-day LaTeX.

I seem to recall running TeX (not LaTeX, but the load
would be only a little greater) on 386-based PCs.
There was no problem (emTeX was the system of choice),
and although things ran slower than they do today, that
was about the only difference.

Ten years for the Point 510. I also used MikTeX on my ThinkPad 755c  
(a 486/75MHz). How many 386 and older machines are still running? My  
wife's Macintosh SE is still limping along though --- suppose I could  
put Textures on it....

And of course the NeXT Cube is about 17.

the epic and carom packages (for xymtex) have at least one conflict with - 
i think - with amsfonts (see below for error).

basically, \ggg is already defined.  so i tried out \newcommand{\ggg}{foo} 
or \renewcommand{\ggg}{foo}, but latex won't let this go.

its somewhat difficult to play around with \newcommand or \renewcommand - 
i.e. playing with different values of {cmd}[args]{def} after the \*command 
- any pointers appreciated.

btw, typing H says maybe ask a human, but it seems i might do X and 'get 
away with it'.

My experience of EmTeX on a 80286 or 80386 PC may help
(also a 68000 Atari)

About 20 years ago, 1986 or so, 
an 80286 machine took longer than 1 second to process (TeX) a  page 
of TeX source. That was still quite usable on a 20 page article. It 
was worth the wait, because the PC could preview (unlike the 
mainframe where you'd print IFF there were no errors in the log.).  
An 80386 PC took  less than or =  1sec per page, and encouraged more 
trial and error.  This was speed was also  achievable on a multi-user 
"mainframe" setup. 

But these were running TeX (or LaTeX) without the big memory 
allocation and extra  TeX  registers as in eTeX.   (I think it's 
called eTeX). Some modern LaTeX packages will require these later 
improvements. (Bigfoot comes to mind).

So Phil is right, TeX runs fine on an OLD machine. But your readers 
may want to run eTeX, which is more demanding. I have a 1GHz PC 
running Windows XP with 0.5Gb Ram about 4 years old that runs modern 
TeX distributions fine. If that's an old machine, then no, no probs. 
Do other users have experience of  intermediate age machines with 
TeX?


How many years  is "old" for you? 4, 8, 20?

best wishes Jay Hammond

Tedy,

That is an interesting question. What prompted it? What would you  
consider old/slow?

In the recent past (within the last few years) I was running LaTeX  
(TeXLive) on a P100 running FreeBSD, both with a GUI (X Windowmaker)  
and without. The machine had 32Mb RAM (I think) and a video card with  
1Mb memory on it, which made viewing pdf's slow but dvi's were fine.  
Overall the machine was quite slow by today's standards but there  
were no operational issues with using LaTeX. Most editing was done  
using vi.

I have a Mac Quadra with 32Mb RAM and that has a LaTeX distribution  
on it. Using it seems quite creaky nowadays.

I have previously installed TeXLive onto a 486 and 386 and found the  
performance to be fairly similar the P100 when compiling LaTeX  
documents and displaying dvi's. But on those machines I found I had  
to be quite careful when setting the memory requirements for LaTeX.

I believe you also need \include{label} in the list of
includes after \begin{document}.  My practice is to
\include all of the files in the whole multi-file document
in the main body of the main file, and then \includeonly a
subset of those files in the preamble.

My daily machine is a PII 400 with 256Mb RAM, running Win2K. I use MikTeX on
it and either edit with WinShell or TeXnicCentre. The computer is about 7
years old and I am in no hurry to retire it.

It's quick, albeit slower that the 1.8Ghz Powerbook. But at those speeds, to
be honest, fast is fast and I don't really see much difference between 1Ghz
and 2Ghz since my brain runs slower than both.

I think the main issue with the older computers is the use or resources like
memory, cache, storage requirements (HD size).

I definitely used to run LaTeX on 33MHz i386 PCs, on Unix (not Linux, it
was before Linus' time).  Before that I had it on a Vax 730 (c.1988).

It's the file label.tex that hasn't been input or included that's the
problem.  You need an \include{label} in your main  file.

Note that \includeonly only tells LaTeX which of the ALREADY \include'd
files to really include. It unfortunately does NOT complain if a file is
missing.

Yes, LaTeX works on old machines.  But if you compare this with word
processors I think that we have to admit that running TeX on ancient
machines had been quite painful.

The first time I used LaTeX I had an Atari ST (8 MHz) with 1MB RAM and
a 720k floppy drive (no hard disk).  I had to put the programs into a
RAM disk because I had to exchange the floppies while the programs had
been executed.  I got a 10MB harddrive later.  It was a significant
improvement.  But after starting TeX, I could still fetch a bottle of
beer from the kitchen, and what and I've seen on screen after coming
back was "This is TeX, Version...".

But there had been word processors at this time which required much
less recources.

You cannot compare TeX with word processors.  Especially ancient word
processors had not been much more powerful than a typewriter and
people had been happy when variable spaced fonts had been supported at
all.

It would be more interesting to compare TeX with word processors which
provide a comparable output quality.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Thank you Phil - I see; I had thought \includeonly allowed one to process 
selected files that are included in the body of the main file so that 
they have the correct cross-references.  For example, I'd like to 
able to print a section of a book so that it has the right 
cross-references, but without having to process the entire book.  Is
there a straightforward way to do this?

By accident, I just found that if I 1) put all the files in the 
\includeonly and put all the corresponding \inlcude commands in the body 
of the main file, 2) process the main file, then 3) remove all the 
\include commands but one, and 4) reprocess the main file, then apparently 
the .aux file from the first processing informs the output of the second 
processing and I get what I'd like.  (But this seems like a work-around.)

Thanks again,
David Romano

Mainly the roff family (http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/utp/), and
scribe (seems to be completely extinct by now) come to the mind. The
roffs are still rocking, actually more than ever by groff
(http://groff.ffii.org/) and nroff/troff
(http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/). Since the seventies they can be used
also for mathematical typesetting. Some time ago they adopted TeX's
paragraph alignment algorithm. But while in say 1986 TeX was already
available on PCs, the roffs were still found only on workstations. They
have a nice tool/pipe philosophy, different programs chained for tables,
equations, pictures,... Btw, TeXLive 2007 will contain a script for
converting pic(groff) generated pictures into something that can be
further processed by pdftex.

I remember running gTeX in PC DOS on an XT.  It ran just about ok except for
font generation which was painfully slow.  I have used various versions of
TeX since on 80386, and various version of the Pentium processor.  Recently
I have been running the current version of MikteX on a 400 Mh Pentium Pro
with 512 MB RAM (about 9 years old) without any problems.  The initial
install took a lon time but the program runs fast enough.

As gTEX came on floppy disks (about 7)  and it contained a workable system
it was considerably smaller than existing versions of TeX.  The next version
that I used was 3-All-Tex (Perhaps the name is not exact) from the early
90's.  In recent years I have used TeX-Live on a 333Mhz pentium 2 with 278MB
memory,  Tex-Live and ProTex (updated over the web) on the Pentium Pro.  Tex
was usable on all these PCs.

I have a 286 setup that is still (I think) in full working order.

Until about 2000 it was used regularly to test LaTeX releases.

Back then we also supported a cut-down version of LaTeX with an
autoload function for non-essential parts.  This was intended
for very small memory TeX's.

Hi,

I can serve with a very exotic candidate.
A few years ago I used the following combination:

a Psion 5mx (handheld computer @ 36 MHz ARM710T RISC CPU, 640 x 240 
Pixel Touchscreen, 4-bit Grayscale, 32 MB RAM, EPOC OS )

XTM software Emulator to emulate full 80186 instruction set with 8087 
math coprocessor.

EmTeX to perform TeX-runs.

The complete set-up was about 18 MB in size including a MS-DOS OS and 
some other programs.

Result: It was a nice task to demonstrate the possibilitiy to run TeX on 
a Psion PDA. However, due to emulation it was rather slow. Finally a 
good DVI-viewer or DVI2PDF converter was missing.

Furthermore, I know that people use LaTeX on there Zaurus PDAs under Linux

Conclusion: I guess (La)TeX run on many many and even exotic machines. 
Age is not important. That might be due to the long development time of 
TeX, which survived many machines and OSes and the fact that many (not 
all) users are on the other hand enthusiastic computer freaks. Porting 
something from one machine to another or from one OS to another one is 
fun for them.

Greetings
Torsten

Message-ID: <200702040131.l141VRcZ024285@strawberry.ncifcrf.gov>

I'm trying to improve the style file for PNAS 

I can get the right format using this command in the preamble:

\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress,round]{natbib}

which makes numbers, sorts, compresses and gives round parenthesis. 
(as per the documentation at
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/natbib.html)

For the bibliography I do:

\makeatletter
\renewcommand\@biblabel[1]{#1.}
\makeatother

However, I'd like to package this together as a single call:

\usepackage{pnas}

For some reason this fails to work whether I name it pnas.sty or pnas.cls.

What (probably trivial!) fact am I missing to make this a package?

Thanks,

Tom

Well, it has to pnas.sty to work with \usepackage{pnas}.  But, if you don't
tell is how it fails, it's a little hard to say what's wrong.  I can only
guess that MiKTeX doesn't find the file; which simply means that you didn't
put it ib the right place or you didn't refresh the MiKTeX filename
database.  Thses problems are all dealt with in the FAQ and are indeed VFAQ.
On the other hand, if you get some specific error message, assuming it
doesn't violate some official secrets act, how about letting us in on it?

Cheers,  Phil

Subject: [texhax] How to include a bitmap file in LaTeX
Message-ID: <BAY110-F1001CA61CC0E46DA8C90AFE89B0@phx.gbl>

Dear all,
EPS files are standard graphical files for LaTex. However, I have two image 
files in .bmp format and I would like to include them in Latex compilation 
process. Does anyone have any experience with this?

I downloaded setbmp.tex from Professor Ablamowicz's website.

============================================
\def\setbmp#1#2#3#4{\vskip#3\relax\noindent\hskip#1\relax
\special{bmp:#4 x=#2, y=#3}}
\def\centerbmp#1#2#3{\vskip#2\relax\centerline{\hbox to#1{\special
  {bmp:#3 x=#1, y=#2}\hfil}}}
=============================================

I  included this file by
\input setbmp

But I could not see the graph by
\begin{figure}[h]
\special{bmp:fig1.bmp x=5in, y=5in}
\end{figure}

Does anyone have any experience with this?

Thanks!
Dingxi

Dear Dingxi,

Does it have to stay a bmp file?  The graphicx package can handle lots of
image formats besides EPS, for instance JPG or PNG.  If it were me I would
convert the bmp to one of those and \includegraphics it the regular way.

You can even configure graphicx to do this conversion for you.   See the
document "grfguide.pdf" on CTAN for more.

HTH,
Matt

Sorry I wasn't so clear.

Ok, so it needs to be named pnas.sty and not pnas.cls (though I don't
understand the difference).  I am keeping the file for now in the same
directory while I work on it so access is not a problem.  I'm doing
the work on a Sun, so it's a different installation, but my
installation is fine.

The relevant calls are:

\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress,round]{natbib}

\makeatletter
\renewcommand\@biblabel[1]{#1.}
\makeatother

When I put these calls into the paper itself, they work.  That is, I
get '()' around the references in the text, citations come out as
(1-3) and the bibliography references look like '1.'.  That's the
result I want.

When I put the same calls into pnas.sty and call it with
\usepackage{pnas}, I get '[]' around the references.  Citations come
out as [1-3] indicating that natbib is being called but that the
'round' command is not working.  The bibiliography looks like '1.' as
desired.

So for some reason the 'round' function of natbib does not work when
natbib is called from inside pnas.sty.

In case a real expert won't answer soon, a few hints:

1. Have you considered LaTeX documentation on
\fbox and \framebox? Well, a few difficulties
with this approach come to my mind. I think
I know how to deal with them, yet I don't want
to expand on this before it turns out that you
can't help yourself.

2. Or visit

     http://tug.ctan.org/search.html

and enter "framed" in the third field (`"Catalogue").
You then get a list of packages that may help you.

3. I don't understand what you are doing within
your environment (i.e.: from where do you have \FOR
etc., and what do the Dollar symbols mean).
However, you should know about packages for
code listings. Perhaps you learn to know them
by entering "listing" instead of the above.

HTH indeed -- Uwe.

I also would like to refer to the package {algorithm2e} which is easy,
powerful, the making the box is pretty easy once you use that option in the
package

Well, 
You Have two choices, to use [\usepackage{multicol}] which is the best
choice as I think, or to use a single and multicolumned tabuler environment
in which you should manually adjust the corresponding contents of each
column. For me, I use the former one which does not make any kind of
contradiction with any of packages I ever used.

                           Call for Papers


    This is the call for papers for EuroBachoTeX 2007, the XVII European
TeX Conference April 28--May 2, 2007, Bachotek (Brodnica Lake
District), Poland.

    The conference is organized jointly by CSTUG, the Czechoslovak
TeX Users Group and GUST, the Polish TeX Users Group.

    The general conference idea is to be true to its title

                "TeX -- Paths to the future"
    
    The community is putting a lot of effort in terms of thought and
deliverables into areas critical to the future of TeX:

* new TeX engines
* enhancing graphics engines
* new or improved macro packages
* user interfaces
* new font technologies

The results find their way

* first into CTAN
* and then TeX distributions

This is perhaps a trivial observation, but nonetheless an important one:
in the center of any of those the users should stand as nothing
of the above has any value if it does not get adopted by them.


    The Program Committee does not restrict what your presentations should
be about but would be more than happy if your contribution will be
user centric and oriented towards the future of TeX.

    Proposals for TeX related tutorials or introductions are especially
welcome. If you have suggestions for tutorials or workshops by others than
yourself or about specific topics, please let us know.

    Proposals (abstracts) should be e-mailed to attention of the Program
Committee which listens at the address of  
papers-EBT2007 at gust dot org dot pl. Boguslaw Jackowski is the
appointed chairman.

    The deadline for abstracts is 5th of March. The deadline for the
final papers will soon be published at the conference web site:
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/EuroBachoTeX2007
 


                           Call for TeX Pearls

We are continuing the tradition of "The Pearls of TeX Programming".
Here is briefly what is wanted:

   * short TeX, MF or MP macro/macros
   * results should be virtually useful yet not obvious
   * easy to explain: 10 minutes at most

If you yourself have something that fits the bill, please consider.
If you know somebody's work that does the same, please let us know,
we will contact the person. Other details and previously collected
pearls can be found at http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls/.

Ok, I tried that:

\PassOptionsToPackage{numbers,sort&compress,round}{natbib}

It gave me this:

Package natbib Warning: Author undefined for citation`Shannon1948' 
(natbib)                on page 1 on input line 83.

I did get the condensed form [1-3], but it has brackets.

I got the same result with

\DeclareOption{natbib}{%
  \PassOptionsToPackage{numbers,sort&compress,round}{natbib}}

So it didn't work.

I had these before:

\usepackage{html} % use this for making html
\usepackage{graphics}
\usepackage{color}

and

\usepackage{pslatex} % Times New Roman Font

afterwards.  I removed the graphics, color and pslatex but the
brackets were still there.

The problem turned out to be similar to the .aux file - I was using an
old pnas.sty.  The direct call works now from inside pnas.sty!
That is, pnas.sty contains (besides comments):

\renewcommand\@biblabel[1]{#1.}
\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress,round]{natbib}

and that does the job.  Sorry for the confusion but thanks for the
help.

Good, glad you got it sorted out - in fact, I couldn't reproduce the
problem.

I'd just like to mention this to Barbara: I don't think there is any real
problem with using \usepackage inside style files.  Indeed, in my MiKTeX
setup latex.ltx contains the following: \let\usepackage\RequirePackage.
Also \RequirePackage works fine with options passed directly inside [].  As
far as my understanding goes (which isn't always that far!) the thing of
passing options is to allow your package to be called with options, which
can then be passed on to other packages.

Cheers,  Phil Ratcliffe

Indeed, this cut-down version was the latexa format. ltnews16

     CTAN:/macros/latex/doc/ltnews16.pdf

(page 1) announced that it wouldn't be supported any longer.
That passage of ltnews16 says that the code will remain.
However, I can't find it. It seems to me that in fact you have
removed it entirely. (It still belonged to a MiKTeX distribution
in 2004.) I am unhappy with that, because I still like to
use my old small TeX installation on an Atari (now with
the TOSbox Atari emulator on an IBM machine).

The reason for not providing latexa anymore is,
according to ltnews16, something like "most" users have
recent machines which are able to run "large" TeX versions.
According to my experience, however, single persons
as well as institutions would like to use their old
machines as long as possible -- even when they buy
new ones. Therefore:

If you keep latex2.09 in the CTAN-obsolete directory,
why don't you offer latexa there? I assume that it is
a matter of about 15 minutes to make or change
a script (docstrip tags!?) that extracts the autoload version
from the most recent full-fledged version.

Cheers,

   Uwe.

A minor technical remark on this proposal:
instead of \ifdocAtrue, you must type \ifdocA

With large documents or differences
(and/or too primitive source editors),
you may experience difficulties concerning
which \if... corresponds to some given \fi.
Another danger is that some inter-word space
may be missing or wrongly doubled in the output
-- unless the user is careful and skilled enough.

At least some of the packages at which this thread
has hinted help in avoiding these problems.

HTH -- Uwe.

Yes, Uwe - I was indeed "rolling my own" and perhaps I should have been more
coherent with my declared philosophy and checked on who'd already rolled it.

Dear Hugo,

Short answer: It?s in latex.ltx.

Long answer When you latex a file, you can see what files are being included
in the standard error output or the log file.  A lot of these will be coming
from a system-level directory.  Look for 'tex/latex/base' in the path.  You
can change into that directory and grep.   On my machine I typed

$grep -Rn '\\def\\@startsection'
/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/tex/latex/base/*

(all one line) Out popped

/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/tex/latex/base/latex.ltx:5610:\def\@start
sect
ion#1#2#3#4#5#6{%

You can also use \show within latex to reveal the definitions of macros:

$ latex
This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.30.4-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.5)
**\makeatletter\show\@startsection
entering extended mode
LaTeX2e <2003/12/01>

thing left to do is to center my ten lines vertically on each page. I
have looked and looked through documentation (found \valign, but
haven't figured out how to use it for my purposes) and will continue
to do so.  Can someone point me in the right direction?

you can do this in a couple of ways:

\begin{tabular}{p{.45\textwidth}p{.45\textwidth}}
some text in the left column, justified, of course
some text in the left column, justified, of course
some text in the left column, justified, of course
& 
and much more text 
some text in the right column, justified, of course
\\
\end{tabular}

as mentioned you can use the multicolumns package

I also use minipage to do this:

\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
text on the left
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
text on the right
\end{minipage}

Sean,

I don't know where you want your line "Midday... to end up, but the
easiest way I can think of is to insert a couple of \vfill's in the
appropriate places, e.g.:

\vfill
line one\break
...
line ten\break
\vfill
Midday...\break
\newpage

will centre your 10 lines and put Midday... at the bottom. Else put the
\vfill after the Midday line to centre your (10 lines +Midday line),
else put \vfill's in both places to provide equal space from the top to
your 10 lines and another equal space to Midday..., else...

Does this help?

Steve

It certainly does help. I didn't proofread my original post(s) well;
the Midday line wasn't supposed to be included in my original post.

Usually the filename extension gives you a hint.  It does not matter
which program produced the files but which output format had been used.   

Since you didn't tell us which TeX distribution you have and about
which files you are talking it's not easy to be more precise.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] Bibtex questions
Message-ID: <45C8CCAC.10605@cmu.edu>

Hi, I've just joined TUG and do not know what the norms are for asking 
questions about TeX, so I thought I would start here.  I've been an 
off-and-on TeX user for better than 20 years but am not overly 
sophisticated.

My particular question is about Bibtex style files.  I have not been 
able to find a style file that suits my discipline (the format required 
in our premiere journal: Administrative Science Quarterly).  I would 
like to create a .bst file that would generate a bibliography consistent 
with our format.  But, while I could do this myself, the learning curve 
is probably too steep for my tolerance level.

Bottom line question: Is there someone I can hire to work with me to 
build such a .bst file?  How might I find someone?  What resources are 
available through TUG to find such a person?  I'm not looking to spend 
tons of money, but I could cough up some funds to do this.

While you can learn to write the .bst, it is probably sufficient to
use the makebst program.  I have a link from my page

http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html

to makebst:

   MakeBst is a program for automatically making bst files.
   If you have LaTeX2e (which you should!) then to run the program just type

   tex makebst 

It's a pain if you don't get it right because one has to do it all
over again (as far as I know), but it can generate a bst for you.

Message-ID: <200702072311.l17NBMe11971@f7.net>

    It seems that Type 1 fonts are no longer supported on MS Windows,  
    that is on Vista. What are the likely impacts on LaTeX?

Well, if a pdf file containing type1 fonts won't be rendered on Vista,
that would certainly be pretty bad.  On the other hand, I'm under the
impression that Acrobat (and definitely Ghostscript and sumatrapdf) do
their own rendering, not using a system library, in which case they'd be
unaffected.  Ditto DVI viewers.

There are opentype versions of many TeX fonts available (e.g., Latin
Modern), and pdftex can use truetype fonts, but that is still not the
most common practice.

On another front, I gather that Vista has many new restrictions on what
users are allowed to do (DRM and all that).  How or if that will affect
TeX, I do not know.

I suspect the answer may be quite simple.  Windows is infuriatingly 
literal about suffixes, and never bothers to read the first ten or so 
bytes of a file (used by the Linux/Unix "file" command) to determine the 
type and content.  For example, a TIFF file with a suffix .tiff, will be 
rejected as unreadable until you rename it as .tif.  Any suffix unknown 
to Windows will be rejected as unreadable.  A file with the .tex suffix 
or the .ltx suffix will almost certainly be rejected; .dvi even more so. 
The original query does not suggest that the correspondent would be 
comfortable reading a .tex or .ltx source file, and a .dvi file would be 
hopeless in that context. 

If you are condemned to work in a Microsoft environment, an investment 
in ConversionsPlus is probably worth the moderate expense.  
ConversionsPlus seems to make use of the initial ID bytes in files in 
order to make intelligent judgements about what Microsoft utility can 
read them.  It is far from comprehensive, but it works most of the 
time.   ConversionsPlus would probably determine that a .tex source file 
was a .txt file and open it in notepad.  A pain in the neck, but at 
least a first approach.

Vista is likely to be twice as restrictive and unresponsive!

I'm talking off the top of my head, but, if I recall correctly, makebst
saves some sort of ini file, which is human readable and which may be edited
to correct errors.

What's wrong with installing one of the free LaTeX-friendly editors (such as

Here is the problem I'm trying to solve.  I'd like to have a particular 
theorem appear twice in a paper, and I'd like its appearance to be 
identical in both, the numbering in particular, without having to set the 
section and theorem counters by hand.

Is there a way of getting a hold of the numbers generated by the \ref 
command so I can use them to set the relevant counters and duplicate the 
appearance of the theorem?  I've tried several sources of LaTeX 
documentation and just can't seem to find a way to do this; the only 
related piece of information I found was that one can "transport" the 
current value of a counter with \value{counter}, but here I'm interested 
in transporting a value that is not current.

I'd be very grateful for any help with this problem.

Thank you,

Thank the Lord for that !  Why /any/ operating system should believe
that it can unambiguously identify a file by reading the first few
bytes remains a complete mystery to me; surely operating system
designers know that /binary/ files are just that, and that
given infinite time, and an infinitely large room containing
an infinite number of monkeys,  every possible byte pattern can
and will occur in every position in an arbitrary binary file.

Not true : all that is necessary is to add .TIFF (or .tiff,
if you prefer) to the list of known file extensions and
to associate it with the same set of semantics as are
currently ascribed to .TIF (or .tif) files ...

 > Any suffix unknown

Not "as unreadable", simply as "unknown", at which point
it behoves the informed user to teach Windows about the
new file extension ...

On the other hand, if the original enquirer were to install any
half-decent TeX editing tool (WinEDT immediately comes to mind),
it would, on installation, associate itself with TeX files after
which they would automatically open in the correct utility.

I reserve judgement on Vista until I have had a chance to try
it in earnest, but already I am impressed by the fact that
I will be able, for the first time, to "Switch user" whilst
authenticating against a domain ("Switch user" was previously
restricted to PCs that were not members of a domain).

And yes, I know that Pierre's position, as mine, is as much
a matter of quasi-religious belief as it is of fact, but I
simply couldn't resist rising to his bait ...

    windows XP won't read the documentation files--wants to know what program  
    they were written in, TEX is not on their list, and Windows can't find out
    from the internet.

there have been several responses to this query,
but i think all of them have been a bit off the mark.

this may not be the correct answer either, but i know
that there are quite a few files on ctan that have
the extension .doc (more than 300) -- which also
happens to be the extension for word files.

the latex .doc files follow the old convention for
documentation files (processable by docstrip).  the
"new" file extension for these is .dtx .

trying to read a latex .doc file via a browser is
an exercise in futility and frustration; you are not
allowed to substitute any other reader than word (at
least i haven't been able to figure out how, and
i've tried!), and word simply throws up.

my tactic has been to transfer the file in question
to a unix box and read it there.  of course, it might
be easier for some to rename the file to something.tex
which i think would allow one to choose notepad as
the reading program even if .tex isn't recognized.

i wish all .doc files would go away.

Actually this quest applies to any OS but for my co-workers MS is
still the One True Way so that has priority.

Does anyone know of a `text editor' that is easily capable of being
made `aware' of both:

  LaTeX syntax (including well-coded packages) 

  Unicode 5.0

The latter must include at least understanding that there are Unicode
slots for numbers above "FFFF.

All information welcome, preferably without fear of favour.

Thanks

Unfortunately some extensions are overused.

Also few versions ago MSIE defied w3 recommendations and defined MIME
type of the web file from its extension rather than to listen the
communication from the web server. It did not work on the web and M$
followed the voice of reason.

Thanks for this very useful link! makebst worked like a charm.

But I have another question: some of the main journals in my field require
that very awkward way of citing that puts references in footnotes, with
"ibid." if the same work was cited in the immediately preceding footnote,
and otherwise a short form or "op. cit.". Leaving all questions of
dodo-birds aside, does anybody know if any package exists for this?  I've
been unable to find  anything on CTAN, but maybe I've missed something.

The inlinebib package, at

The following is adapted from a suggestion in the FAQ for lists, it should
be possible to do something similar for theorems.

\documentclass{article}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A

  \newcounter{it:last-scalar-rule}%

  \item C
\end{enumerate}
And here's a repetition:

  \addtocounter{enumi}{-1}
  \item B

Hi,

I think a number of people like to work on Windows with notepad++[1],
which can highlight multiple syntax types including TeX.
It comes in a zip file (portable) so I presume it would work in Vista
too...

UTF-8 is supported by LaTeX and Emacs.  I strongly recommend the alpha
version of Emacs because UTF-8 support (and many other things) had
been improved significantly since version 21.

At

   ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/auctex

you'll find binaries for Windows and sources for other platforms.

The package also provides auctex, reftex, and preview-latex.

In order to install it on Windows you just have to extract the zip
file and to link bin\runemacs.exe to the desktop.  I "only" have
TeXLive installed at work and I suppose that Emacs uses kpsewhich in
order to find out where the LaTeX files are installed but I don't have
any experience with MikTeX.

After installation go to the menu:

   Options => mule (Multilingual Environment)

It works quite nice on UNIX.  Maybe it will not work on Windows
because there are too many monkeys...

But do you really think that filename extensions are more reliable?

I don't think that .doc files are the problem.  CTAN, tug.org, and TeX
distributions nowadays provide all documentation as .pdf, .dvi, or
.ps.  On the servers there are also some files in html.

I guess that the problem is that Windows hides filename extensions by
default.

How we can set the different top margins on odd and even pages ?
(e.g. odd side top margin = 2inches; even side top margin = 3inches)

Thank you,

G. Sharma

Simply `UTF-8 support' is not sufficient for `Unicode 5.0'.  The editor has
to support the high numbers, sometimes called the supplementary planes.
[And this is the reason for exposing this calleng here: that is where
some mind-bogglingly way-out slots, inspired by LaTeX-maths, have ended up.]

That sounds promising: is that GNU- or X-Emacs?
(I have not had much success with mule so far, especially on Windows.)

And thanks for the `beginners guide': just what I need!

It certainly looks impressive!  And very likely that these guys would
be aware of the extra needs of Unicode 5.0 support even if they do not
provide it yet.

But there is `full' and `full' in the real world:-).

Certainly the mechanism is not foolproof, but I prefer it to

I tend to forget these issues because I configure Windows to shew

Since Reinhard suggests a look at Emacs, I have to suggest a look at
the latest vim. :)

Useful links:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html
http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/mbyte.html

I have no experience with Unicode 5 and vim, so I don't vouche that it
works; expect to ask the vim users (or Markus :).

You've got to be kidding.  I have yet to have "file" fail me except for 
a few really messed up text files.  Of course, one can create a 
collection that will include some false positives by using "split" on a 
large binary file and then trying all the fragments in order, but even 
then, you have done no harm.  The /usr/share/file/magic* files suggest 
that there is a large, perhaps excessive, universe of strange file 
formats out there, and some of them introduce ambiguities, but what user 
is working in that universe?  Most of us get along with fewer than a 
hundred, even including graphics formats.

I do not really know what unicode 5 is, but one limitation that I have 
found in using utf math symbols with vim is to find a font to display 
those symbols. Since vim only uses monotype font, you also need a font 
to display all the math symbols you are looking for. In big fonts like 
courier and lucida monotype, the common math symbols (greek letters, 
set relations, binary operators) etc are present, but many of the 
exotic symbols are not. I do not know if there are fonts that contain 
all these symbols.

Very hard to say, if it does not work for you.  I have tried
following the link you give, which opens in my copy of SeaMonkey
(a Mozilla derivative) and then asks if I want to open it with
WinZip, open it with another application, or save it to a file.
I select "Save it to a file", browse to "My documents", and
select [OK].  The download manager then opens, I see 2667Kb
transferred, and the file ends up in "My documents".  Can you
talk us through the analogous sequence of steps on your
computer, and identify at which point it seems to fail ?

Looks like you have a problem with your computer: I just downloaded it from

I've been collecting a list of tools like that at:

http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html

Search for 'differences' and you will see that latexdiff will probably
do what you want.  It worked nicely for me recently.

   Given 2 latex source files, it produces a 3rd latex file with
   additions/deletions highlighted in color.

Subject: [texhax] longtable.sty caption
Message-ID: <45CCE029.2010602@tin.it>

Hi,

I'm using longtable.sty for some tables that are longer than one page.
Now, my only trouble is the \caption[]{} command. For some reason it 
'anarchically' places the top caption in random alignments (i.e. 
centered, other times seemingly right flushed..)

The end results is that I often have the caption begin almost in the 
middle of the page, and go beyond my right margin.

Any help on how to prevent this, or force the caption to be left-flushed?

 thanks

 Martin

Chris,
you may try \clearpage after each table, and put all tables at
the end of your document.



or, depending on the table size, 
  \begin{table}[p]
  ...
  \end{table}
which would at least put tables on a "page of floats"

regards,
        Dieter

I think two things are required: 

  1. You need a table which maps [sequences of] keystrokes to
     characters.  Emacs calls such tables "input methods".  There are
     input methods for many languages but I do not see anything math
     related.  However, with such an input method and UTF-8 encoding
     you should be able to to create a file which can be read by
     LaTeX. 

  2. You want to see what you type.  I do not know how much of this
     task is handled by Emacs itself and how much is delegated to the
     operating system.  I suppose that the OS is much more involved.

  > That sounds promising: is that GNU- or X-Emacs?  (I have not had

GNU-Emacs.  If you had not been successful I guess that your Emacs is
too old.  An advantage of ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/auctex is that the
binaries I use on Windows at work are created from the same sources I
compiled on Linux at home.  This makes life much easier.

On a Windows machine of a Vietnamese friend I tried input encoding
utf8 and font encoding T5 and all I had to do in Emacs had been to
switch between input methods "german" and "vietnamese-viqr" in order
to typeset German and Vietnamese within the same document. (Well, I
just tried again and see that I can even access German characters with
vietnamese-viqr.)

I suppose that many people on this mailing list do not know what we
are talking about.  Ideally, the whole Unicode stuff should be buried
deeply in operating systems.  Anyway, for people who are interested,
Markus Kuhn's Unicode FAQ is the best starting point:

   http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html

Message-ID: <20070210182026.74a6b70b.phthenry@iglou.com>

I used the code below to redefine my section, but it didn't work when I
used \section*:

\let\OldSection=\section
\renewcommand{\section}[1]{\singlespacing\OldSection{#1}\doublespacing} 

The problem is that Latex sees the "*" as the first argument. I am
trying to get my titles to be only single spaced, though I might also
want to customized my sections in different ways, so I would like a more
general solution to customizing \sections.

Thanks

Hi All,

I'm a regular user of the sideways figure float from the rotfloat  
package. This package works well with all of the latex document  
classes that I have tried with the exception of the memoir class.

Can someone help me with an alternative to the rotfloat package that  
will work with the memoir class.

All of the on-line documentation that I have read says that the  
memoir class is capable of handling rotated floats, but I have not  
been able to find any example code to show how it is done.

Message-ID: <20070211210728.GB793@turki.gavron.org>

I have a few text files that I would like to convert to LaTeX.

Is there any tool that does this..?

A google search appears to indicate that txt2tex adds minimal TeX
formatting to a plain text file, which is precisely what I need, but so
far I haven't been able to locate a debian package that provides this
utility. 

I tried a large number of programs available on my system that convert
the text files to html, pdf, ps, dvi, dvi, etc. then and use another
utility to convert the intervening format to LaTeX but so far I haven't
gotten anywhere.

Has anyone done this before who might be able to recommend a simple
solution?

Thanks,

cga

Don't know a thing about debian packages, but generally, TeX stuff is  
available on CTAN.  Check the TUG website for pointers (<http:// 
www.tug.org>).  Links will be on the left side of the home-page.

Thanks. I found it on CTAN alright but I'm concerned I might screw up
the debian packaging system if I install packages via CTAN. 

Unless someone has a better suggestion I guess I'll take the chance.

Have no fear.  It appears that txt2tex is just a perl script.  You can put
it in a directory called "bin" below your home directory, then make sure
that directory is in your in your $PATH, and you can use the program without
getting in the way of your pristine package system.

If that's too complicated, you can just put the txt2tex script in the same
directory as the files you want to convert.  Make sure it's executable by
typing

$ chmod 755 txt2tex

Then just run it!

Hope that helps.

Adding files to /usr/bin might cause conflicts with the Debian
packaging system, but /usr/local/bin is the correct place for programs
not supported by Debian.

Since the current working directory is hopefully not in the search
path for executable files (programs) you have to type ./txt2tex in
order to execute the program.

For a "general" part of your question, I guess that Heiko Oberdiek's
refcount package from

     CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/

is what you are looking for.

Considering merely the single problem that you (David Romano)
posted, however, I guess that my previous advice would be
"shooting cannon balls at sparrows", "as (about) we Germans say"
(i.e., the effort is very much more than what actually is needed).
My suggestion:

  1. Put some \label{thm:glorious} into the first environment
     that generates your "glorious" theorem.

  2. For repeating your "glorious" theorem, just type
     (and change what doesn't fit your design):

       \begin{trivlist}
         \item[\bfseries Theorem \ref{thm:glorious}]
         \slshape %% ... or \itshape ...
         <Repeat text body of your "glorious" theorem>
       \end{trivlist}

[-- This finishes the kernel of my suggestion;
the following remarks rather address "TeX philosophers".]

I find the present query interesting because I myself
like a style used in (philosophical/...) theory of
measurement where the most interesting results
are stated in a first part of a section;
while proofs follow in a kind of appendix (of the section).
With this idea however, I hadn't just /repeated/
such theorems. Rather, I introduced some technical terms
and used them for restating the main results in a hopefully
more transparent wording.

... sorry, LaTeX counters are used too carelessly anyway.
(I am thinking of similar discussions concerning LaTeX3

Subject: [texhax] Can't find required tool" message in TexShop
Message-ID: <b1e614c90702120236i2fb7b398n4f4b211fcc42b7c@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Texhax,

I'm a new member. I've successfully used Tex (TexShop) for two years on my
iMac running system 10.4.8. Three days ago I downloaded the beta6 update of
TexShop, and got an error message that a program was missing (perhaps the
same error message as
below - I'm not sure). A day later I noticed that beta7 was available, and
hoping for better luck I tried it, getting the same error message.

I then tried to go back to the texhop I had used before. Several times I've
removed all tex programs and downloaded MacTex from www.ctan.org and
reinstalled, getting the following error message each time:

Can't find required tool.
/usr/texbin/pdflatex does not exist. Perhaps teTeX was not installed or was
removed during a system upgrade. If so, go to the TeXShop web site and
follow
the instructions to (re)install teTeX. Another possibility is that a tool
path
is incorrectly configured in TeXShop preferences. This can happen if you are
using the fink teTeX distribution.

I've tried wihtout success to install teTex (it comes as a bunch of files
without an installer). I do find "fink" files on  my machine, but I don't
know
how to reset the path.  When I search my computer for pdflatex, it is not
found.

In preferences in texshop my settings in "engine" are:
Path settings: /usr/texbin
Distiller: /usr/local/bin
Tex programs: pdftex --shell-escape
Latex program: pdflatex --shell-escape

Can you give me any help? I can open but cannot typeset any of my tex
documents. I am not familiar with the unix command structure, but will try
if necessary and with help.
Thanks,
Geoff Berresford

Hello,

In the past I have been using  lyx version 1.3.3 (win32). Now I wanted to upgrade and therefore I wanted to install  the latest version of lyx (1.4.3-5). I didn&#180;t remove any part of the former versions before (lyx, image magicks and and MIktex) and installed the wohle lyx-bundle. No problems appeared so far. But when I wanted to start lyx after teh installation I received the following error information:

LyxTextClassList::Read: no textclasses found! 

Can you tell me what to do?

Best regards,
Kris

Hi 

I have a lot of equations in my document and am using align* do display

Document class option [fleqno] flush equations left for the whole document. 

Is there any way to have some equations centred and some flushed to the left

Thanks a lot,

Please ask your question again on the LyX users' mailing list (details
are to be found at the LyX website; the list can also be found on
news.gmane.org by which I'm sending this mail). Your chances of
meeting someone who knows the internals of LyX on Windows is
much greater there than on texhax/support.

Hi Geoffrey,

pdf(la)tex is definitely included in the mactex distribution.  I can
only surmise that is not being installed in /usr/texbin.  In fact, I'm
pretty sure that is not the standard location, it's more likely
something like
>> /usr/local/teTeX/bin/i386-apple-darwin8.3.1/pdflatex
>> /usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin6.8/pdflatex

mactex also includes TeXShop.  I suspect if you uninstall your existing
TeXShop and reinstall the full MacTeX, things will work.

You don't really want to use the fink and/or teTeX versions.  They
aren't maintained any more.

If problems persist, please try writing mactex-support at tug.org to reach
the MacTeX maintainers.

Best,
Karl

/usr/texbin is a symlink to any of recent TeX distributions for Mac  
OS X. It's an ingenious device, by Gerben Wierda and Jerome Laurens,  
through which a user can shift from a TeX distribution to another by  
simply selecting it in Mac OS X System Preferences. TeXShop and other  
front-ends are adopting this mechanism, so they set the path to /usr/ 
texbin, and let the user choose which distribution that symlink  
points to.

The OP posted this problem he has in comp.text.tex, but he hasn't  
replied to our question as to which distribution he's using, so we  
can tell him which absolute path he should set in TeXShop, instead of  
the symlink path TeXShop uses now by default.

Best,

Axel

Would it not be simple and sufficient just to add something like

\document class{article}
\begin{document}

at  the start of the text file  and

\end{document}

at  the end of the  file.  If you wish to duplicate  the text layout exactly
then you might consider using a verbatim environment.

Just a note: LyX handles text import quite nicely (either import/ASCII
or via pasting into the program window). I often use it to quickly
import stuff from other formats. LyX is included in debian.

This is definitely a good idea.

AFAIK, modern TeX distributions embed all fonts by default.  You can
find out which fonts are not embedded using the Acrobat Reader: Select
File=>Document Properties=>Fonts in the menu.

On UNIX systems it is more convenient:  Run 

   pdffonts somefile.pdf

and you'll get a list.

If some fonts are not embedded, it would be nice to know which TeX
distribution you are using.

  Reinhard

Well, here is one solution:

% use a default setting in case you want to change the spacing in the
future.
 \let\DefaultLineSpace=\doublespacing
 \makeatletter
  \def\@makeschapterhead#1{%
 \singlespacing
    \vspace*{50\p@}%
    {\parindent \z@ \raggedright
      \normalfont
      \interlinepenalty\@M
      \Huge \bfseries  #1\par\nobreak
      \vskip 40\p@
    } 
 \DefaultLineSpace}
  \makeatother

That seems to work. I am using the memoir class. I assume that if I put
this at the beginning, I can stil se memoir commands to customize my
chapter headings. I assume that I can find teh default settings for
sections and subsections by looking at memoir.cls.

Subject: [texhax] how to put endnote in caption
Message-ID: <20070214204715.0fa7d19b.phthenry@iglou.com>

I have a document with four tables. Each table has a caption. I need
to put a endnote in the caption so that I can inform the reader the
source of the table. However, the endnote package crashes when I try
to make the end note part of the caption:

\caption{Chain Store Growth in the Early Twentieth Century}\endnote{some
source and so on.}

Is there any way around this other than not including a caption at all
and putting the caption outside of the table, and having to use
Chain Store Growth..\endnote{some source}
\addcontentsline{lot}{chapter}{Chain store....}

I got this to work. In the preamble, I put the following:

\newcommand{\myCaption}[2]{\stepcounter{table}
\vskip3ex\centerline{\tablename{} \thetable{}:  {#1}{\endnote{#2}}}%
    \addcontentsline{lot}{table}{\protect\numberline {\thetable}\protect
\ignorespaces {#1}}
}

Then my table looks like this:


\begin{table}[h]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|p{1in}||p{1.5in}|p{1.5in}|}
\hline
{\bfseries Year} & {\bfseries Chain Store Companies} & {\bfseries Chain
Store Units}\tabularnewline \hline1900&25&226\tabularnewline\hline
1910&125&1,127\tabularnewline\hline
1920&553&15,568\tabularnewline\hline
1930&1478&69,534\tabularnewline\hline
\end{tabular}
\myCaption{Chain Store Growth in the Early Twentieth Century}{source}
\end{table}

Thank you, Uwe -- The package you suggested should do the trick.  My 
intention *was* to "preview" a theorem which would be stated "officially" 
in a later section of the paper, and I think I may need the cannonball 
after all: My worry is that the journal I submit the paper to may have 
a very local implementation of the theorem environment, and so even if I 
try to mimic the appearance of the official theorem, it may end up looking 
different in the published article.

Best,
David

When does that happen? You can insert a negative space \!

Why not use \dot ?

\newcommand\vecdot[1]{\ensuremath{\dot{\vec{#1}}}}

Message-ID: <e3d1b4df0702151406r1f55d886je0baf103e514fe26@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have a strange problem with BibTeX and NatBib. I want to cite the PSTricks
book by Herbert Vo\ss. BibTeX is rather picky about special characters, such
as accented letters. They have to be included in a pair of braces, with the
\ of the special character immediately following the opening brace. There
cannot be any other braces surrounding these braces.

According to the manuals this is a correct example:

   author = "Kurt G{\"o}del",


It surprises me therefore that my entry

   author = "Herbert Vo{\ss}",

does not work!

Actually, it does work partially. In all my references in the text
(author-date references using the NatBib package) the \ss character is
typeset properly. However, in the bibliography at the end of my document it
does not work. There it typesets ss instead of \ss.

All special characters in book titles (including the title for this
particular reference!) print properly too. It's just the \ss and only in the
bibliography itself that fails to work.

Does anyone know how to solve this strange problem?

Thanks for your help,
Yuri.

I have been told by a kindly soul why my BibTeX entry

>   author = "Herbert Vo{\ss}",

displays ss rather than \ss: it is because of the font I use.

When \ss printed in regular caps or small caps (as they are by default with
the style files I use), then it automatically becomes ss, according to
German grammar...

The reason this is a pain is because of how lists are constructed.
LaTeX calculates the indent at the beginning of the text, and the label
is snuck on by counting left from that point on the page.

Here's a hack and a recipe for hacking things like it: find the place in
latex.ltx or article.cls that contains the code you want to modify.  (In
the hack that follows, it's the definition of enumerate.)  Copy it into
a \makeatletter\makeatother pair in your text, fidget until desired
results are acquired.  Resist the slings and arrows of those who tell
you that you are making trouble for yourself by hacking what you don't
completely understand.  (They are correct, but I assume you are already
aware of that, and have sorted through CTAN to no avail.)

See this, too: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=chngmargonfly
This is a fully-approved LaTeX-compatible way to do it, but it will be
challenging to get your labels to line up exactly on the left margin,
unless someone here can offer a trick I don't know.

But assuming you still can't make it work, try something like the
following, but remember the warnings above.  You'll have to hack
further to get rid of the periods on the numbers, but I guess that's an
exercise best left to the hacker.

Maybe it helps if you look at "File->Document Properties->Fonts" in
Acrobat Reader.  All the fonts you use should be embedded.

If you have the program "pdffonts" installed on your system, please
send us its output.  It does the same as AR but is much easier to use.

If you want to redirect what you see on screen to a file, do

   pdffonts myfile.pdf > fonts.txt

Message-ID: <45D55405.5070506@unob.cz>

Dear friends of TeX and its future,

EuroBachoTeX 2007 conference
http://www.gust.org.pl/conferences/EuroBachoTeX2007
will be held from 28. 4. 2007 to 2. 5. 2007 at Bachotek, near Brodnice,
in the north-east of Poland. This meeting, organized by GUST and CSTUG,
is targeted for all people interested in the future employment of TeX
based typesetting and typography. Following BachoTeX tradition, the
event not only meets high scientific standards, but has the friendly social
athmosphere.

As the conference is an ideal meeting place for people from the Central
Europe, CSTUG weighs up the possibility to organize a bus for 
participants of EuroTeX from
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Poland and 
perhaps other
countries. Our decision depends on the number of the persons seriously 
interested in this bus.
The supposed road map would be Bratislava, Brno, Praha and then to 
Poland. It can change
depending on the interest of participants.

Please be so kind to inform the members of your local TUGs about such a 
possibility to
travel to EuroTeX. We need to know the number of persons seriously 
interested in the bus
till the end of February to be able to decide about the definite road 
map, the price etc.
They can contact me at the e-mail address given below.

In case there will not be enough people interested in the bus CSTUG will 
partially support
the transport by cars of its members only.

Sincerely,
                  Jaromir Kuben
                  president at cstug.cz

:) -- BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU!
Below I place a legal way to do it -- with examples.
I hope you understand how to customize it.
It may be more close to what was asked for than Tom's

My code furthermore assumes that no nesting of such
environments is required. Note the similarity to the
{thebibliography} environment. Indeed,

     \newenvironment*{enumileftaligned}[1][0]
       {\renewcommand{\section}[5]{}\thebibliography{#1}}
       {\endthebibliography}

is another hack working as well on my installation.
If you use \bibitem then in place of \item,
you can refer to items by \cite. [:)]
(Well, I haven't thought much about several such lists
in one document, and I won't any more. That package
managing several bibliographies in one document
may help.)

I was wrong. The above code doesn't change the spacing. The only thing I
find to work is this code:

\newcommand*{\Chapter}[1]{\singlespacing\chapter{#1}\doublespacing} 

\newcommand*{\ChapterNoNum}[1]{\singlespacing\chapter*{#1}\doublespacin
g} 

The only other code I got to work involved changing the makechaphead and
makeschaphead, but these commands nullifiied any of the other macros the
memoir package used.

Subject: [texhax] verbatim environment problem
Message-ID: <20070219074438.GB8040@goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au>

I'm writing an explanatory text about Bourne shell scripting.

I need to be able to use a lot of control characters in 
text I'm writing. I can usually get it to work but this has me 
stumped. Any suggestions gratefully apreciated.

I want to put some text in a "sidebar" but the parser seems
to think I'm in math mode for some reason.

I've tried  \verb and \verbatimtab also. They did not
work either. I also tried \{lstlisting} It did not work either.

It looks like an interaction between the parbox or the fbox and
the verbatim, but I need them to get a reduced size paragraph in 
a box, don't I?


The following file demonstrates the problem:


\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-0.25in}
\setlength{\textwidth}{7in}
\setlength{\topmargin}{-1in}
\setlength{\textheight}{9.55in}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{fancybox}
\usepackage{a4wide,epsfig,ifthen,alltt}
\usepackage{ulem}
\usepackage{float,graphics,verbatim,moreverb}
\usepackage{upquote}
\usepackage{textcomp}
\usepackage{listings}
\floatstyle{boxed}
\restylefloat{table}

\begin{document}

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{

\textbf{Note:} One of the problems with \textsc{Unix} as an ``open system''
is that a variety of people have developed \textsc{Unix} commands, shells and
other tools.
There is no corporate ``big brother'' making sure that all of the commands
work the same way.
The above construct is a case in point.
In Bourne shell and Korn shell the correct usage is as above:\\
\begin{alltt}
	ls .[!.]*
\end{alltt}

But, for \texttt{tcsh} (the default login shell on CS\&IT systems), \texttt{csh}, \texttt{zsh},
BASH and probably a few other shells that use command history systems,
the ``!'' character is used to signify a substitution from the
command history.

On these shells, to get the same result you would need to use:\\
\begin{alltt}
	ls .[^.]*
\end{alltt}
}}

\end{document}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The error message from LaTeX is:

Underfull \hbox (badness 10000) in paragraph at lines 42--42

! Missing $ inserted.

                $

? q
OK, entering \batchmodeExit 1

Thanks in advance for assistance.

Indeed, there is a problem with the Plone 2.0.5 version, the engine for the GUST site. If the browser's preferred language is set to a language different from English (en), Polish (pl), Czech (cs) or German (de) it will great you in  this very unfriendly manner. 

Until we find the way to fix it, please use e.g., en (English) as the preferred language in your browser whenever visiting any of the GUST (http://www.gust.org.pl) pages. The EuroBachoTeX pages are in English anyway...

Our sincere apologies,

Martin may have the more correct answer (I haven't tried it).

Note that the 'uparrow' is a math symbol, so (La)TeX expects it to be  
in a "math environment". Thus, as a simpler change, to avoid the  
error, there are two approaches (the second being the one you want, I  
think; but try them both):

ls .[$^$.]*

or

ls .[$\uparrow$.]*

right diagnosis, inadequate solution.

since the ^ indicates a superscript, the first
suggestion will yield a complaint that it's
incomplete.  and the \uparrow isn't the same
shape.

here's a (plain tex) trick to get a character
"to print as itself" in a tt mode:

  ls .[\char`\^.]*

just precede the character in question with the
string "\char`\"; it even works with backslashes.

Gee.  No one's ever called me inadequate before :-}

I don't see the complaint in the log file.  I'm using TeXShop on Mac  
OS X, and all I see is some 'underfull \hbox' babble.  No other  
complaints.

This may be a simple matter of fonts, but I get the following  
(forgive the PDF in-line), where the order is as above (with your  
version last):

To me, the 'uparrow' in the second line looks most correct.  The  
third looks like a 'caret'; the first, like a lowered 'caret' on a '.'.

Am I missing something?

Thanks!

symbol ^ (circumflex) into a coding instruction
in typewriter style:

\begin{alltt}
  ls .[^.]*
\end{alltt}

he got an error message about $ being added ...

two suggestions involved math mode:

  ls .[$^$.]*
  ls .[$\uparrow$.]*

to which i countered

    > right diagnosis, inadequate solution.

    Gee.  No one's ever called me inadequate before :-}

er, that was the solution, not the instigator.
i wouldn't dare tack that label on someone i've
never met.  <g>

more commentary:

    > since the ^ indicates a superscript, the first
    > suggestion will yield a complaint that it's
    > incomplete.

    I don't see the complaint in the log file.  I'm using TeXShop on Mac OS X,
    and all I see is some 'underfull \hbox' babble.  No other complaints.

i'm not sure why there wasn't an error, but see below
for justin's description of the output (pdf file was
attached to his message, but not included here).

i also pointed out that

    [...] the \uparrow isn't the same shape.

and suggested a (plain tex) trick:

  ls .[\char`\^.]*

from justin:

    This may be a simple matter of fonts, but I get the following (forgive the
    PDF in-line), where the order is as above (with your version last):

    [pdf omitted]
    
    To me, the 'uparrow' in the second line looks most correct.  The third
    looks like a 'caret'; the first, like a lowered 'caret' on a '.'.

    Am I missing something?

the uparrow is in the symbol font, not typewriter.
in the first example, the circumflex appears as an
accent since it wasn't given an empty place-marker
so it would appear by itself.

the third example, however, appears exactly as it
does in my mail reader, with the exact ^ character
as it appears in the cmtt font.  admittedly, i am
using a low-resolution monospace font for reading mail,
since it's important for me to be able to distinguish
input niceties like this.  i suspect justin is using
some "fancier" font, so he's not used to seeing the
"old-fashioned" monospace teletype style.

since justin advertises himself thusly,

i can assure him that i've practiced long and hard
to be just as curmudgeonly as he is (just ask any
of my colleagues on the tugboat production team!
<g>), though i don't seem to have found such a
reliable source of funding.

To set the record more straight-ish: this is from Don Gingrich; I

Ah!  So it was a font thing...

Not me, man.  Being curmudgeonly (cf. below), I do the monospaced  
thing in my reader as well.  For much the same reasons.

Perhaps not as long as I, though...

A man does what he must...

Thanks for the detailed explanation!

Indeed, citing some funny TeX error message, "this can't happen."
Please post an example the next time you observe the problem.

Message-ID: <EEC01C43-15D7-4E7F-90B0-9685AF1A6574@gmail.com>

Hello. How are you.

I have a problem using \footnote{} in the chapters. I mean, when I  
write the following:

\documentclass[12pt,letterpaper]{book}

\begin{document}

\chapter{Hello...\protect\footnote{sometimes, used to begin a  
telephone conversation}}
\newpage
Hello everybody...

\end{document}

The header appears with the footnote number increased at one. In this  
case, 2.

So, How can I solve this LaTeX error?


Thank you, so much.
Have a good day.

Please try usng the packages "boxedminipage" and "fanvyvrb", as below:

  \begin{boxedminipage}{14cm}
    \textbf{Note:} One of the problems with \textsc{Unix} as an ``open
    system'' is that a variety of people have developed \textsc{Unix}
    commands, shells and other tools.  There is no corporate ``big
    brother'' making sure that all of the commands work the same way.
    The above construct is a case in point.
    In Bourne shell and Korn shell the correct usage is as above:
    \begin{Verbatim}
      ls .[!.]*
    \end{Verbatim}
    
    But, for \texttt{tcsh} (the default login shell on CS\&IT systems),
    \texttt{csh}, \texttt{zsh}, BASH and probably a few other shells
    that use command history systems, the ``!'' character is used to
    signify a substitution from the command history.
  
    On these shells, to get the same result you would need to use:
    \begin{Verbatim}
      ls .[^.]*
    \end{Verbatim}
    \end{boxedminipage}

I think plain "verbatim" package works here, but you may need "fancyvrb"
to do some fncy things later.

You can use the package lscape (i.e., \usepackage{ lscape}) and then you can
do as follows

\begin{landscape}

Text here

\end{ landscape }

By doing so, the lines between the begin and end will be in landscaped
fashion and the outside will be normal one!

Martin gave you the pointers, but what he didn't say is that it's probably
going to be a long, long job; there is no free, easy, push-button way to
convert and equations, for example, can be very troublesome.

Good luck.

I was writing a document which contain several kind of fonts, two of them
are URW Antiqua Condensed and URW Grotesk Bold.

When i compile my document using TeXLive 2003 which installed in Windows
2000 Service Pack 4, i got some warning message that say :

"Warning: pdflatex.exe (file ugqb8r): Font ugqb8r at 720 not found"
"Warning: pdflatex.exe (file uaqr8rc): Font uaqr8rc at 720 not found"

but when i compile same document using TeXLive 2003 which installed in
Windows XP Professional SP2, that warning message dissappear.
Where is the difference between two of operating system I use that make this
error appear?
Can you tell me why this problem occur? What must I do to solve this
problem? Is there any way to patch/complete Windows 2000 so that error don't
occur again?
Thanks for your attention and explanation.



thanks,

I think this is too difficult to be worthwhile. (see other posts,e.g 
Philip Ratcliffe  especially about equations not converting 
adequately to Word) Please consider wanting something different. 
i.e.Tell us why it has to be Word?

For instance would a PDF of the thesis be readable, portable, 
printable for you?

Would a paper  version be something that you and your supervisor 
could both edit?

Dear Tedy -- Are you speaking of exactly the same system,
manifesting different symptoms depending on exactly which
operating system you have booted to, or two different
systems that have /apparently/ identical installations
of TL-2003 but which may, in fact, actually have different
files installed ?

You can convert LaTeX to RTF:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/
http://filburt.lns.mit.edu/oops/Html/SW/wxwin/tex2rtf/t2rtf.htm
http://www.tug.org/utilities/texconv/ltx2rtf3.html

Or you can convert PDF to Word:

http://www.pdftransformer.com/pdf-to-word/
http://www.solidpdf.com/

Or you can convert LaTeX to Word:
http://www.word2tex.com/

A few options to choose from, each providing differing capabilities and
functions I am sure.

Cheers

I found esp. solidpdf yileding excellent results on most
equations and keeping the complete layout as I like it. 
Still you have to do some equation re-editing, but at a reasonable level....

Tedy sent me the output of pdffonts.  I cannot see any problem there.
All fonts are subsetted and embedded and no unusual fonts had been
used.  See:

       http://ms25.ath.cx/fontlist-tedy.html

Maybe someone else has an idea?

I suppose that xpdf and ghostscript will be able to display the file
properly, and most likely Acrobat Reader too.

Tedy, can you try other PDF browsers?  Do they complain too?

Regards,
  Reinhard

often it's related to some older gs and Acrobat bugs regarding Resources
handling for embedded PDF files (/Type /XObject). But to check this
would require the problem PDF file.

This seemed to work, although I don't understand why.
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{alltt}
\begin{document}
\begin{alltt}
   ls .[\^\,.]*
\end{alltt}
\end{document}
Just putting a space after \^ gave too much space between the caret and 
the period.

If we are going to debug the PDF file, shouldn't we move the
discussion to the ntg-pdftex at ntg.nl mailing list?

And where should Tedy put his file?  I don't know how large the file
actually is, should he send it to the list or to me.  It's not a
problem for me to put it on my web server (which seems to be more than
1000 times more reliable than sourceforge.net or berlios.de).

  Reinhard

He could simply file a bug report at sarovar. The tracker can handle
file attachments up to 2 mb, I think. If it's too large, services like
http://www.sendspace.com/ are always an option.

looks like it's simply some path problem. IIRC Tedy tells of 2 cases: In
one PC/Win system pdftex finds the font, then the PDF file is ok. In the
other it obviously doesn't find it, then the PDF file is broken. Simply
needs checking where the font file is in both systems. A kpsewhich
something.pfb helps.

Tedy, can you locate the font (.pfb) file by such a kpsewhich call?

Sounds plausible, but we can only guess until Tedy tells us more. I'm
still waiting for basic information like version of pdftex...

But why should Acrobat look for fonts if all fonts are embedded?  As
far as I understand the problem, Acrobat assumes that one of the fonts
is not embedded and tries to use a system font instead.

Tedy wrote that he tries with two systems. On one system, when this
happens during pdftex run:

> "Warning: pdflatex.exe (file ugqb8r): Font ugqb8r at 720 not found"

then he gets this later from Acroread:

"Could not find a font in Resources dictionary - using Helvetica instead"

On another Win version the first message does not appear, and everything
is ok also in the viewer. Seems you simply got the wrong file from him,
the one that was ok :-) He should check his paths...

Sorry, I missed this.  It seems that TL-2003 is broken on one machine.
It is very unlikely that it is a Windows issue.

There are 3 ways to solve the problem:

   1. Install TL-2003 again.  If disk space doesn't matter, make a
      full install.

   2. Install TL-2007, download from ftp://tug.org/texlive/Images .

   3. Use kpsewhich to find out which file is missing.

Debugging is quite difficult because of the completely braindead
warning message:

> "Warning: pdflatex.exe (file ugqb8r): Font ugqb8r at 720 not found"

There is definitely no file "ugqb8r" in TeXLive and there is
definitely no scalable font "at 720".  If a font "at 720" is not found
I guess that there is something wrong with the map file and *.mf files
are assumed.  But then I'd expect that metafont complains.

But what is "file ugqb8r"?

And why is this a warning and not an error message?  Where does it
come from?

BTW, people who ask questions on various mailing lists are often
blamed for not providing enough information.  But quite often, if
people provide more details, nobody responds.

Did anybody notice that the warning message is ***completely***
useless?

Regards,
  Reinhard

    There is definitely no file "ugqb8r" in TeXLive 

Sure there is.  It is URW Grotesq, one of the earliest freely available
fonts.
texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/urw/grotesq/ugqb8r.tfm

Usual reason for this is that there is a map file entry but the type1
isn't there ...
texmf-dist/fonts/type1/urw/grotesq/ugqb8a.pfb

Don't know if this is at all relevant to the original problem, but
anyway ...

Message-ID: <45DDD345.2080505@uit.co.uk>

I am typesetting material that contains many code examples
and program output listings, some of which are very wide.
I have to use a monospaced font.

If I just reduce the text size, it becomes almost unreadable,
and anyway the main problem is the width, not the length.

1. Can I somehow transform the standard courier font so that it
    is say, X percent narrower, without reducing its height?

2. Or, is there a good, free, narrow/condensed monospaced
    font available?

	Thanks,

ps: I have looked through the LaTeX Companion and
     www.tex.ac.uk but can't see what I need.

Latin Modern has a light condensed variant, which gives approx. 120
characters/line.

Hi,

I am trying to make lineno to work with xr: I want to refer to lines of 
document A from document B. It appear to work, except for the pagewise 
mode: even when I specify pagewise mode (in both documents), I get 
global line numbers. Is it possible to make it work?

Also, a question regarding lineno alone: Can I use lineno (or some other 
package) to refer to line numbers, without actually printing the line 
numbers?

Thanks,
Moshe

I do not have an answer for you on the condensed font
but I use 
\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\fvset{frame=single,numbers=left}

I place the VerbatimInput inside a minipage

The very first "\right." (indicated <===!!!) above is unpaired.  You can't
match it with "\biggl("; you must match "\left" with "\right".  Just use
"\bigg(" for the preceding parenthesis and drop the "\right." altogether.

I don't think so. It looks like you thought I meant section headings, but I
meant page headings.

(Yeah, I find it confusing too; I would have thought that the things that
appear on each page were "headers", but the "A Guide to LaTeX" book calls
them "headings" rather than "headers", so I assumed in my posting that that
was the standard LaTeX terminology. Maybe it's just peculiar to that book.
The word "header" doesn't even appear in the index.)

I apologise for the confusion.

"Header" is widely used in the TeX world (see, for example, The LaTeX  
Companion). In any case, the solution is to combine graphicx and  
fancyhdr (see the documentation for the latter for more complete  
examples).

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\usepackage{graphicx}

\fancyhead[R]{\includegraphics{graphic}}

\begin{document}
\pagestyle{fancy}

Message-ID: <649286230@web.de>

Hi Moshe, 

it's me who is the current maintainer of lineno.sty, 
so I would have been the proper addressee, 
especially when something doesn't work.

Oh my, this is a challenge. However, I have often mused 
about re-implementing references to pagewise numbers, 
and the re-implementation I have in mind should support xr. 
The current problem is that (in pagewise and switch mode) 
\linelabel writes 

    \getpagewiselinenumber{<absolute_line_number>}

to .aux files, not the actual line number on that page. 
The latter number is calculated by \getpagewiselinenumber 
-- however, this needs additional information from the 
document that issues the \linelabel. If your current document 
tries to calculate the line number, it looks for the needed 
informations in its own .aux. -- That re-implementation 
may need a few days since I am busy with other urgent things.

 After \usepackage...{lineno}, \let\LineNumber\relax should do this, 
or \renewcommand{\LineNumber}{} if you are a LaTeX purist. 

Actually I am working at a lineno package option doing this, 
the main purpose being to support moving wrapped figures 
within a paragraph in a comfortable way 
(without looking for a word after which a line break is good). 
A rudimentary version of this has worked in a project 
that just has been finished. The name of the option could be 
"invisible", or what do you think?

Cheers, 

  Uwe.

Just to answer Philip Taylor:

\section{%

Ok, the principle is the same, assuming that you do atually know how to put
something in the page header ;-)

If you don't, a simple answer is this:

\pagestyle{myheadings}
\markright{%
  The man who started it all:
  \protect\includegraphics[height=2ex]{C:/TeX/texmf/doc/latex/pst-pdf/knuth}
  (Donald Knuth)
}

or to use something like the "fancyhdr" package:

\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\rhead{%
  The man who started it all:
  \protect\includegraphics[height=2ex]{C:/TeX/texmf/doc/latex/pst-pdf/knuth}

Hi,

You should firstly remove the margins of the PDF. This is easily possible
using the adobe acrobat professional (from the tools menu choose advanced
editing then Crop Tool) once you do so, you will be able to identify what
you want to crop and once again you go to the tools menu and choose the same
procedure (advanced editing then crop tool), the identified crop area will
be colored in blue. Proceed by clicking OK and enjoy the new tight pdf
without margins.

Hopefully this is helpful

Cheers

That's what I saw. What I don't quite understand (because I don't know 
enough about TeX) is at which point the command in this file are read 
and expanded. Maybe it's possible to force the expansion of 
\getpagewiselinenumber before writing it to the file? that would solve 
the problem.

From the point of view of my usage, something like 'refonly' would make 
sense (I am trying to generate a list of changes for my thesis, and I 
would like to include the line numbers where these changes occurred, but 
without adding numbers to the thesis itself.)

Anyway, for me the method you mentioned above is good enough.

I believe GIMP is available for Windows, too.  Anyway, pdfcrop.pl
might be simpler for this purpose, and it should run on Windows as
long as you have Perl and cygwin:

You can use either pdfcrop to crop the included PDF, or use the trim
or viewport keys to trim the inclusion:

\includegrahics[width=5.25in,trim=1in 1in 1in 1in,clip]{framewrk}

Hi Hartmut,
this message is much more helpful than the original one.  The most
important thing is that the complete name of the file is mentioned.

But why does pdftex print a warning message and then creates an
invalid pdf file?  I think it should abort with an error message and
remove the output file.

Regards,
  Reinhard

    this message is much more helpful than the original one.  

But it will lead users to try to find pk files, which will cause just as
much if not more confusion.  The real issue here is map files, but I
don't know how pdftex can determine that.

Suppose there is an entry for this font in pdftex.map, why does pdftex
try to access a bitmap font?

It is still an assumption that pdftex tries to load a pk file.  pdftex
says that it cannot find a particular file but it does not tell us the
name of the file.  That's definitely wrong, even if the whole truth is
more confusing. 

Regards,
  Reinhard

right, this happens only if there is _no_ map entry for the TeX font
(else it would just complain that the .pfb is not readable). E. g.:

\pdfmapline{} \nopagenumbers
\font\ugqb ugqb8r at 10pt \ugqb foo \bye

here no pdftex.map is read. To force the error you need to remove
ugqb8a.pfb from the path, e. g. by renaming the file. Then pdftex tries
to generate a PK file for ugqb8r.tfm by running gsftopk on ugqb8a.pfb
(some name magic here), gsftopk fails, then the warning is issued.

So it happens if one thinks yes it should be a .pfb file, but the
relevant entry is not in pdftex.map or the wrong pdftex.map is used
(error 1) and not even the .pfb file is in the search path (error 2).

BTW trying it with Helvetica gave confusion; i had removed all
phvr8a.pfb from the path, kpsewhich found nothing, still the Helvetica
PK file was generated --- because gs then obviously uses its own
PostScript font repository; gsftopk adds one level of fuzziness :-)

Subject: [texhax] Warning: empty pages and cannot insert PDF or JPEG picture
	...
Message-ID: <1172474871.15227.20.camel@localhost>

Hello!
I am a newbie in Latex, finishing my second or third thing in it. I use
Tetex under Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper). I run into two problems, while trying
to compile:
First, when I use bibtex, I receive warning: empty pages in two
references. I am using '\usepackage[longnamesfirst]{natbib}' and
'\bibliographystyle{elsart-harv}'. All other references are okay, and
the warning message disappears when I change 'elsart-harv' to, for
example 'apa'.
Second, I simply cannot insert picture in PDF or JPEG format. Only to
convert them into EPS beforehand. I use: '\usepackage{graphicx}' (or
'\usepackage{graphics}') and standard picture insertion, from a
guidebook:
\begin{figure}
\caption{\label{fig:distribution01} Title for the picture}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{jeff.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\caption{\label{fig:distribution01} Title for the picture}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{jeff.jpeg}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

When I run latex <filename> I receive error message:
! LaTeX Error: Cannot determine size of graphic in paradigms.pdf (no
BoundingBox).

Only thing that I can do is to use '\usepackage{epsf}' and:
\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfxsize0.9\textwidth
\epsffile{graph01.eps}
\caption{\label{graph:1} Examples}
\end{figure}

Can anyone help with the warning messages and to explain what I do wrong
with the pictures.

Thanks in advance. Sincerely,
Petar M

In these cases a common piece of advice is to do some bedtime reading ;-)

Well, it means what it says: two of the entries in your bib file do not have
page numbers.  If that's ok with you, just ignore it, otherwise add the
relevant page numbers to the two entires in your bib file.

> Second, I simply cannot insert picture in PDF or JPEG format. Only to

Ok, this really is a VFAQ and the "graphics" documentation does answer it.
Anyway, the simple answer is: that's the way it is, you can't - but read on!

The full answer is that (La)TeX can only handle eps figures, while
pdf(La)TeX can handle jpg, pdf, png (but not eps). So if you want to use
LaTeX then your only choice is conversion to eps.  Otherwise, use pdfLaTeX.

> [snip]

By the way, it is recommended practice NOT to include the graphic file
extension, thus:

 \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{jeff}

In this way you can have both formats present (eps and say jpg) and LaTeX or
pdfLaTeX will auomatically use the appropriate version.  In other words,
ALWAYS use \includegraphics (or its brother \includegraphicx) to include
graphics.

I'm trying to insert color into the pdf files I create from LaTeX source --

(We're Running version pdfeTex 3.14... 1.21a-22
Web2c 7.54, if that helps)

According to the latest version of the Lamport book, I can use

\textcolor{red}{text to color}

or

\color{red} {text to color}

This does nothing!  I suspect I'm missing a macro package somewhere but 
I don't know where to start looking.

I did look in the archives and everything seemed quite beyond what I'm 
trying to do :-)

Thanks!

Why the log? Use the -recorder command line switch. See pdftex(1).

On a Mac, the Preview application can also do the same thing, and it comes
with the OS.

Make sure the ?marquee? (rectangle) is chosen over ?Tool Mode? on the
window?s tool bar.  Click and drag to select the rectangle you want to keep,
then select the menu item Tools->Crop.  Save. Easy as pie.

Subject: [texhax] How to get current section etc number into page heading or
	footing?
Message-ID: <1172552247.14965.44.camel@math.jpl.nasa.gov>

I looked at the faq at http://www.tex.ac.uk/ and couldn't find an answer
to the question "How do I get the current chapter.section.subsection etc
number into a page heading or footing?"

By "current" I mean what one would get by putting a \label immediately
before the end of the page, assuming there's nothing in the way (such as
an enumerated list item) that would get labeled by something other than
a section etc. number.

I'm not using fancyheadings or anything like that.  Here are my
header/footer definitions:

 \def\ps at headings{%
  \def\@oddhead%
    {\hff \hdate \hfill \hftitle \hfill \vers}%
  \def\@evenhead%
    {\hff \vers \hfill \hftitle \hfill \hdate}%
  \def\@oddfoot%
    {\hff \cpright \hfill \midfoot \hfill \thepage}%
  \def\@evenfoot%
    {\hff \thepage \hfill \midfoot \hfill \cpright}%
 }

where I define \hff, \hftitle, \vers, \hdate, \cpright and \midfoot.
I'd like \midfoot to be the current chapter, chapter.section,
chapter.section.subsection... number.

My first thought was to use \renewcommand{\midfoot}{\@currentlabel}, but
that gets the label of an item in a list or indeed any of my special
counters if the footer falls in the middle of one of my special numbered
thing-o's, such as note boxes.

I tried to mimic how LaTeX sets \@currentlabel, but that required me to
know what was the current level of document subdivision.  So I tried
putting something into the appropriate @startsection command, but that
produced either nothing in the footer, or the index of the next document
division if that was the first thing on the next page, or the number of
the previous document division or..., probably because the stuff in #6
is processed *before* the appropriate counter is refstepcounter'd.

Thanks in advance,

I had a problem with PdfLaTeX and colors.  At the beginning of some 
pages the colors set by \color{...} or \textcolor{...}{...} where 
changed.  With LaTeX everything was OK.
Looking into the faq's, I found that there is some problem with 
color-xcolor packages and PdfTeX, that can be solved with the package
 
\usepackage{pdfcolmk}

after
\usepackage{color}

May be it solves your problem.

This is fixed in pdfTeX 1.40 with a recent pdftex.def.

[when using graphix.] All's fine with pdflatex, however using
htlatex for html (which solves other problems) requires the
extension to find the file.

I'd like to specify the 'image' filename and let pdflatex use
the image.pdf file while htlatex incorporates the image.png file
inline.

I seem cornered to making two tex files, one for pdflatex and
the other for htlatex.

is there some way to coerce htlatex to use the image.png file
while continuing to use image.pdf in pdflatex. or maybe there is
another solution?

apparently I can just specify image.png in tex, but with scale=1
the pdf has resolution problems. so my best fix is to make big
images and scale=0.25 for png in both document types, which seems
kinda lame.

-recorder is fine for new projects. But what about my old ones?

tetex,  when I run

lambda test

and get as output the folowing

When I try

oxdvi

I get nothing on the screen and a warning message

I use the attached hacked greek.bgd file. The test.tex file is written in 
iso-8859-7 encoding. If I uncomment the two lines in greek.bgd I don't get any 
lambda output error, but oxdvi doesn't give anything different.

Any hint?
