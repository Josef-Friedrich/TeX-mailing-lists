    How to use ARIAL in LATEX, MIKTEX.

The easiest answer is what Will sent.  If Helvetica will suit, do that.

If you really specifically need Arial,

1) XeTeX can use installed fonts on Windows, although I am not sure if
anything special needs to be done.  

2) The MS core fonts are available
   from http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/, with TeX support in the
   winfonts package
http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=winfonts.  Or
   so I gather.  I've never used them myself.

Hope this helps,
Karl

Subject: [texhax] How to truncate lines in a fancyvrb Verbatim environment
Message-ID: <46600B0F.3030608@uit.co.uk>

I'm typesetting material which includes a lot of sample program outputs,
which are plain text, typeset using \VerbatimInput from the excellent 
fancyvrb
package.

Some of the lines are very long.  Is there any way to truncate them
automatically?  (I could edit them to fit, but that means keeping
extra, incomplete versions -- being able to do this automatically
would save a lot of work.)

  Thanks,
  Niall

Dear All,

I have some more information on this.  I was originally getting the
wrong output, McGlashan 1995 (1911) b,( instead of McGlashan 1995(
1911) b,a because this construction in natbib.sty:

\newcommand\NAT at parse@date{}
\def\NAT at parse@date#1#2#3#4#5#6@@{%
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#1=11\def\NAT at year{}\def\NAT at exlab{#1}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#2=11\def\NAT at year{#1}\def\NAT at exlab{#2}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#3=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2}\def\NAT at exlab{#3}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#4=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2#3}\def\NAT at exlab{#4}\else
     \def\NAT at year{#1#2#3#4}\def\NAT at exlab{{#5}}\fi\fi\fi\fi}

assumes that, if the construct like "1995a" or "1995 (1911)a" has more
than four tokens, the fifth token is the citation letter (a, b, etc.,)
and uses it as such (it's a sort of very long-term millenium bug,
whereby natbib will fail in the year 10000.)  So, Philip's trick of
enclosing the whole year construct in parentheses, year="{1995
(1911)}", gave the correct output, because it reduced the number of
tokens in the year to 1 <= 4.  It produced error messages (I guess)
because the catcode of a multi-character token is non-numeric, so
\ifnum can't cope with it.

One solution would be to make a version of natbib.sty with something
like

\newcommand\NAT at parse@date{}
\def\NAT at parse@date#1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8#9#10#11#12#13@@{%
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#1=11\def\NAT at year{}\def\NAT at exlab{#1}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#2=11\def\NAT at year{#1}\def\NAT at exlab{#2}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#3=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2}\def\NAT at exlab{#3}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#4=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2#3}\def\NAT at exlab{#4}\else

   \ifnum\the\catcode`#6=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2#3#4#5}\def\NAT at exlab{#6}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#7=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2#3#4#5#6}\def\NAT at exlab{#7}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#8=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2#3#4#5#6#7}\def\NAT at exlab{#8}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#9=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8}\def\NAT at exlab{#9}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#10=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8#9}\def\NAT at exlab{#(10)}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#11=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8#9#10}\def\NAT at exlab{#11}\else

but that's not permissible due to having more than nine parameters.
Anyone have any better ideas, please?

I have a relatively small picture generated by the pspicture  
environment, which I would like to put inside a paragraph of text,  
say on the right side.  I want the text to justify itself so as to  
leave room for the picture next to it (ie, I want the paragraph text  
to "run around" the picture).  How is this done?  (I figure it has to  
do with minipages or \makebox, but I don't quite understand how these  
interact with pstricks---and to be honest, I don't entirely  
understand how they work.)

Really truncate, discarding material? Or break over two lines?

	Really truncate -- ends of lines thrown away.

	The sample outputs in question are only illustrative
	with detail explained elsewhere in the book.

Thanks for the pointer.  I've now tried various permutations of the
method from the FAQ, all of which fall over with a "missing number"
error message when they encounter an ordinary four-digit year withour
an "extra" citation letter.

The solution turned out to be to use braces, as Philip suggested, to
reduce the number of tokens in the year to one:

year="{1995 (1911)}"

then edit the definition in natbib.sty to avoid putting the first
token of the year in an \ifnum:

\newcommand\NAT at parse@date{}
\def\NAT at parse@date#1#2#3#4#5#6@@{%
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#2=11\def\NAT at year{#1}\def\NAT at exlab{#2}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#3=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2}\def\NAT at exlab{#3}\else
   \ifnum\the\catcode`#4=11\def\NAT at year{#1#2#3}\def\NAT at exlab{#4}\else
     \def\NAT at year{#1#2#3#4}\def\NAT at exlab{{#5}}\fi\fi\fi}

However, I suspect this might run into some kind of trouble if two
things by the same author, both of which are year-less, get cited.

Then I would try my truncate.sty package, defining \FancyVerbFormatLine
in terms of \truncate.

Hi,

I'm trying to create an environment with picture commands in it, such as /line, /vector, etc.  In addition, I am trying to color it.  The code is given below.  The line it is graphing \line(10,13){20}, should be the same line.  However, it graphs two separate lines separated horizontally.  In addition, if the % is removed before the \put in the {newpicture} environment in the body of the code, the line moves around more.  Why is it moving around?  I think it should only show one line, but it is showing two.

Try removing the spaces:

Folks,

This is my first post to texhax.

I see parskip as a way to control vertical space between paragraphs.
Is there a way to control the amount of vertical space 
between section headings and the subsequent paragraph?

The easiest way is to use the "titlesec" package and the command 
"titlespacing". For example,

\usepackage{titlesec}

\titlespacing*{\section}         %% heading command
               {0pt}              %% increase left margin
 	      {\baselineskip}    %% vertical space before heading
               {2\baselineskip}   %% vertical space after heading

Please see the documentation of the package for details.

You can try the titlesec package.

Subject: [texhax] Customising list environment
Message-ID: <D1B3B7EF-7AA7-4526-8B33-71D6E919F3A0@sidec.com>

Hi,

I have defined the following list environment in a document based on  
the memoir document class.

\newcounter{deliverablenum}
\newenvironment{deliverablelist}{%
   \begin{list}{\normalfont\bfseries D\arabic{deliverablenum}:}
   {\usecounter{deliverablenum}
    \setlength{\labelwidth}{0.5cm}
    \setlength{\leftmargin}{0.8cm}
    \setlength{\rightmargin}{0.3cm}
    \setlength{\itemindent}{0.3cm}
   }
}{\end{list}}

I have several issues with the current construction.

1. The counter "deliverablenum" is reset each time I start a new  
"\begin{deliverablelist} ... \end{deliverablelist}". How can I  
prevent that? I want the counter to be incremented throughout the  
entire document, across chapters, appendices, sections, etc.

2. The list label is, as one can see in the code above, given as  
"D<num>" where "<num>" is the current value of the counter  
"deliverablenum". Cross referencing using the standard "\ref"-command  
yields the value of the counter "deliverablenum", i.e. "<num>". I  
would like the standard  "\ref"-command to yield the entire label,  
i.e. "D<num>". How do I do that?

3. How do I prevent the paragraph that follows the list to be indented?

4. How do I adjust the vertical spacing before the environment?

5. How do I adjust the vertical spacing between items in the list  
environment?

Sincerely,
Ozan ?ktem

Excellent indeed! And for easily typesetting in various scripts using  
your own system fonts, there is XeTeX:

http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex

If you use the recent TeXLive 2007 distribution, chances are you  
already have XeTeX.

I've attached a bare bones LaTeX document, it uses the array package and
defines a new 'C' centered column type.

The first table in the document is processed OK, but note that the third
column type is not a 'C'.

The second table has the third column type a 'C'.  LaTeX processes the
the first row of the table OK, but chokes on the last line.

I've stared at this all morning and can see the problem.  I've attached
a pretty complete log file with traces as well.

Many thanks in advance,

Subject: [texhax] Writing explicit newline to external file
Message-ID: <4669360B.3050108@dr-qubit.org>


I asked this question in another thread, but I have a feeling it got 
buried amongst all my other comments and the replies, so I'm asking it 
again afresh.

Is there some way to write an explicit newline character to an external 
file in (La)TeX? None of the following seem to work:

\write\@stream{blah blah^^Mfoo bar}
\write\@stream{blah blah\\foo bar}
{\lccode`|=13 \lowercase{\write\@stream{blah blah|foo bar}}}

I know I could do this by writing one line at a time, using multiple 
writes, but this is unfortunately impossible for my purposes.

Any help much appreciated!

Thanks,

Toby Cubitt

Does the following do what you want:

\newlinechar=`^^J
\write\@stream{blah blah^^Jfoo bar}

What exactly do mean by an "explicit" newline character?  Anyway, what about
this?

\write\@stream{blah blah\string\\foo bar}

Message-ID: <000901c7aa59$bbec1110$372d3344@randy9b4f288eb>




      I'm trying to define a count register in terms of a macro.  This is
discussed to a limited extent 
  
      near the middle of  p. 379 of the TeXbook..  The command  \n=\csn
works just fine if \csn is very 

     simple, \edef\csn{\the\n} or \edef\csn{1234}, but fails if the number
1234 here is the result

     of a process, the result of a macro.  \csn is defined by
\edef\csn{\macro}; it might be necessary

     to use \noexpand or a token register as described on p.216 of the
TeXbook to get the result of the  

     \macro in \csn.  Anyway,  \n=\csn fails with a 'missing number' error
showing some of the code in

     \macro.  I don't know how to tell TeX  to forget about  the process,
\macro, leading to the result 1234.


    I've ran head on into this problem, in one disguise or another, many
times since taking on TeX.
    
    So, I would be very grateful for any help anyone can give me.   In any
case, thanks very much
    
    for looking into it.

Thanks for your message.  With your help I've got it almost perfect.
One little problem remains: truncation seems to behave differently
around a space character.  The little test file below shows the problem:

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\usepackage[breakall]{truncate}
\renewcommand{\TruncateMarker}{\rule{1em}{1em}}  %% make it easier to see
\def\FancyVerbFormatLine#1{\truncate{6cm}{#1}}

(Output shown as PDF in http://uit.co.uk/norobots/verbtrun.pdf )

Lines 7 and 9 are slightly short.
(And changing the truncate length from 6cm to 5cm makes it go very weird.)
Is there a way to ensure truncation at exactly the same place?

	Thanks,

This works fine for me:

\newcount\n

\def\macroA{12}
\def\macroB{4}
\def\macroC{\macroA3\macroB}

\n=\macroC
% \n=\numexpr\macroC\relax

\the\n

\bye

For more complicated macros, you can try \numexpr.

It seems that suddenly my xdvi (xdvik version 22.84.1) won't obey options like

Can anyone please suggest why this happens and to work it out?

You can get all manner of formats here:

Depending on what system your son uses, OpenType (OTF) might be the  
way to go.

Perhaps he could go back to CM's roots (well, AM's really)

Just the truncation marker.  If you don't use one there is no
difference.  Otherwise you'll need to specially define the verbatim
active-space to allow breaks before *and* after, instead of just 
before.  That could be:

\makeatletter

\def\FV at Space{\hskip\z at skip\hbox{}\ \hbox{}\hskip\z at skip}

or 

\renewcommand\FV at Space{\hspace{0pt}\mbox{}\ \mbox{}\hspace{0pt}}

\makeatother

In your distribution you might have a clsguide.pdf. For example, I  
have it in

/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/doc/latex/base/

Or you can find it here:

I was trying to distinguish between a newline character appearing 
explicitly within a single write command, and a newline character being 
written implicitly when two lines are written with two different write 
commands.

> \write\@stream{blah blah\string\\foo bar}

Did you test this yourself? I only ask because it doesn't work for me. 
Rather, it just writes "\\".

That does the trick! Thanks very much!

In fact, it even seems to work without the first line. I guess I was
close with my attempt using ^^M, but picked the wrong control character.
  It works under both Windows and Unix, but I wonder if using linefeed
instead of carriage return will cause problems in other ways? Is that
the reason for first setting \newlinechar?

I want to place two pictures side-by-side inside a pspicture  
envinronment:  one involves plotting a curve, for which I need to set  
a much smaller yunit.  So (trying to mimic the "cat" on pp. 148-150  
of the Latex Graphics Companion) I created two commands, one to draw  
each picture, then used an \rput to place them next to each other.
Here is the code:
******************************************************************
			\newcommand{\GPic}{%
				\psset{yunit=0.1 mm}
				\psline{<->}(-1.5,0)(1.5,0)
				\psline{<->}(0,-120)(0,120)
				\rput(-1,0){$|$}\uput[dl](-1,0){$-1$}
				\rput(1,0){$|$}

You're welcome :)!

I suspect that's because LaTeX (or something else) has already set it
like that (see below).

In fact, you can use any ASCII character you like for \newlinechar.
This tells TeX to break a line at this character.  E.g., try this:

  \newlinechar=`a
  \write16{abcdabcd}
  \bye

^^J is kind of a standard, though.  And if you set \newlinechar=-1
(which is the default in plain TeX), no such conversion will take
place.

I believe this will work on any system, because the TeX port knows the
native "line break" for the platform, so the \newlinechar will be
converted to whatever the line break on the system happens to be.

Oleg

Subject: [texhax] Tools/GUIs for making tables in latex?
Message-ID: <466E47A0.2020707@jth.hj.se>

Hi.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a tool or GUI to facilitate 
creating nice looking tables in latex? I've tried a number of solutions 
  I found through Google, but none of them does everything I end up needing.

Simple tables are fine, but when I want linebreaks, lists, etc. in the 
cells, if I want to control orientation/alignment of contents per cell, 
it gets to messy to handle manually, with mulit-columns, parboxes and 
what not. Now I've resorted to create the tables in Word, export as PDF 
and insert as graphics.

Regards,

Thank you, but not to the point.  I have a publisher that apparently knows

Just to say "probably a majority" is not specific enough.

Fondo de Cultura Econ?mica:

We published books with TeX in the 80's and 90's; recently, only LaTeX

Right now, for example, I'm working on the Spanish edition of David  
Wells' Prime Numbers.

Two LaTeX typeset books have received awards in publishing art by the  
C?mara Nacional de la Industria Editorial Mexicana:

http://www.fondodeculturaeconomica.com/ED_Detalle.asp?ctit=061029E

and

http://www.fondodeculturaeconomica.com/ED_Detalle.asp?ctit=061001E


And not only have we published math or physics books typeset in LaTeX  
---also, e.g.,

http://www.fondodeculturaeconomica.com/ED_Detalle.asp?ctit=008506RA&ti=M

or

http://www.fondodeculturaeconomica.com/ED_Detalle.asp?ctit=046212R


Right in front of me, I have The Cambridge Handbook of Physics  
Formulas, by Graham Woan. Also by Cambridge University Press, a  
beautiful book in LaTeX is Wenk & Bulakh's Minerals:

http://www.amazon.com/Minerals-Constitution-Origin-Hans-Rudolf-Wenk/

And you can see (or download) the PDF of a non-commercial book: El  
Gran Telescopio Milim?trico, published by INAOE/University of  
Massachusetts:

There are some editors for creating tables in LaTeX (mixed with other
stuff, I have to admit...) in the TeX Catalogue:

  http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/bytopic.html#misctables

Also, both TeXMaker and TeXNicCenter provide wizards for creating
tables.

A list of German publishing houses that LaTeX authors have reported to
accept either LaTeX source or a ready PDF/PS output from LaTeX source
was compiled by Henrik Grotjahn a while ago. He donated it to my
website when he re-organised his own:

Hello,

Is there a simple way to get a word on the inner margin next to related
text, as is typically done in the documentation of most packages available
from CTAN? I tried last night to do just that: add a keyword in the inner
margin in front of the first line of some paragraphs of a report I am
working on. I expected to find a simple package to do this (maybe an
update of marginpar) but I failed miserably in my search.  Surely this
must be available since inner margin words are so common in documentation
files.

Thanks for your help

Hi all,

I'm writing chapters of my book now that are thick with exercises. I
want to place them directly where they are relevant but they don't look
right. A glance at my maths books suggests this is never really done,
although I'm sure I've come across this approach in programming books
before, especially the lighter ones, which unfortunately mine is not.
I'm going to rewrite the first chapter that uses exercises now, and
place the exercises at the end of the chapter, and see how it reads. I
think this goes somewhat against the flow, but it seems the norm.

Does anyone have any strong opinions on this one way or the other? If
leaving exercises in situ is okay, I think I need to find a way of
numbering them that does not seem to clash with the definitions and
later on, the theorems. I could find a way to number the exercies with
the same schema used for these but I don't know how to do this and I'm
as yet undecided on the numbering scheme for definitions, theorems and
the like anyway. The default numbering scheme seems fine for papers, but
overly elaborate for a book.

Any opinions on this would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,

James

See my book on p-adic numbers. I didn't follow the convention of putting 
exercises at the end. It depends on what you're trying to do, but it 
worked for what I was aiming for in that book.

The theorem package would allow you to set up a separate numbering 
scheme for exercises, but (as you'll see in my book) I ended up creating 
my own macro for exercises, and just numbered them sequentially 
throughout the book.

Religion, opium for the people. To those suffering pain, humiliation, 
illness, and serfdom, it promised a reward in an afterlife. And now we 
are witnessing a transformation. A true opium for the people is a belief 
in nothingness after death---the huge solace of thinking that for our

Hi James,

interesting question and I guess you will not find a definitive 
solution. First of all I believe, that it strongly depends on your 
audience.

Personally, I like to have exercises or better an example embedded 
within the text. This helps me to directly follow what was written just 
a few lines above on a practical example. Others may like to read first 
the complete chapter and sit down and try to follow the exercises 
afterwards.

I guess it also highly depends on the topic of your book. If the theory 
is rather complex I guess I like to get an example within the 
description to make the theory clearly understandable for me by 
following the inline-exercise. Other may don't like to be disturbed by 
exercises since they first like to get an overview before they start to 
play around with it.

However, you might combine both methods, just add very short and rather 
simple exercises which helps to understand the theory behind it within 
the text and add additional exercise at the end of the chapter.

Anyhow, I prefer a clear separation between text and example. Many new 
books follow this rule by adding a horizontal line before and after a 
exercise, adding a kind of pictogram beside the exercise, or drawing a 
box around the exercise. This help readers of both groups to find there 
reading style.

There might be different point of views for engineering, programming, 
maths, physics etc. topics. I like more the engineering / programming 
point-of-view. I really think it hardly depends on the topic and on the 
audience.

Just my two cents...

If one is going to extend the usage of ``publishing house'' to  
include scholarly societies, then there're a lot of them which use  
LaTeX --- SIAM comes to mind, pretty much all of the mathematics/ 
physics-oriented ones do. One could get a good/quick overview of this  
by checking CTAN for documentclasses / packages related to specific  
publications.

Hi,

I think the answer is to typeset the exercises in the same manner as the
definitions and theorems and leave them in place. I can then put the
answers at the end of each chapter, to save the reader too much page
turning, possibly.

I may try to adapt the exercises package, I've had a look at the style
file, my first attempt at this kind of thing. Probably I'll end up
trying something on my own, though, I think.

Regards,

James

"Real and Abstract Analysis" by Hewitt and Stromberg is one book that 
immediately comes to my mind which uses this scheme.

Please have a look at the "amsthm" package; also how counters are used in 
LaTex.

LSU used LaTeX for the Collected Poems of Robert Penn Warren.

WordTech communications has used LaTeX for poetry also.

Message-ID: <DB873318D1A41648BEAC4B5AAB63B3E1136EC817@MESSAGE-AH.ad.mathworks.com>

Hello TeX Users Group,

 

I have recently been exploring TeX from "First Principles", and have
been looking at tangle.web and weave.web.  For each of the major
platforms (Windows, Unix/Linux, and Mac), there is a suggested TeX
Distribution (proTeXt, TeX Live, and MacTeX) that contains tangle and
weave executables.  From "First Principles", there should also have been
distribution-specific versions of tangle.ch and weave.ch to get the
bootstrapping started.  It appears that these change files do not come
with the distributions.  My assumption is that the reason for this is
that the average TeX user would need to worry about them, and that the
point of the TeX distributions is that someone else has already done the
work for us!  Does anyone have a reference to the actual
platform-specific change files tangle.ch and weave.ch that may have been
used to create tangle and weave for various distributions?

 

Thanks,

Brian

Wrong. Check the sources of TeXlive; online svn available e.g. at

Last time I looked, they had a statement:

  "We cannot accept TeX and LaTeX: if no other format is possible,
  please ask the manuscript editor's advice."

The current link

http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/index.html

does not say this anymore, but they don't mention LaTeX at all.
Does anyone actually know their policy?

Hi Brian,

Always nice to hear about people looking into the actual code :).

    platform-specific change files tangle.ch and weave.ch that may have been

These change files (and a whole lot more that is necessary for the
build) are included in the sources.

In the case of TeX Live, that's the big source.tar.bz2 file in
ftp://tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/source (it's also included on the
DVD).  I don't know exactly where the sources are located in the other
distributions.

You can also browse the TL sources in various ways.  See
http://tug.org/texlive/svn for details.

Hope this helps,

Subject: [texhax] More exercises
Message-ID: <000001c7ae82$07a12010$4101a8c0@biggus>

Hi,

thanks for all the replies on this subject and apologies for not getting
back in person (too busy).

Okay, so I have a simple command \exercise which numbers and italisizes
exercises and a command \answer which I can place inside exercises to
grab the exercise number. The answers are saved in a vbox and
regurgitated by the \showAllAnswers command. I understand the workings
of the vbox stuff well enough, I believe although embedding the answer
within the exercise means that I have to effectively `embed' an \upshape
command in the \itshape command, but no matter at this point.

My problem is that this design does not support verbatims in the
answers, which are essential. I understand the reason, I cannot pass
verbatims as parts of command arguments. How can I work around this? I
can define the answer command as an environment instead, but how do I
get hold of the contents of the environment? I have trawled through the
exercise package in order to get this far but cannot deduce how it grabs
the contents of its own answer environment, or if it takes this approach
at all. 

One further thing to note. I have tried to google simple commands such
as \unvbox and other (I guess) low level TeX commands found in the .sty
files but google comes up with nothing pertinent. Whatever documentation
or discussion there is available on the web relating to this kind of
stuff just doesn't seem to get indexed.

Thanks again everyone for the advice so far.

The code for what I have so far follows. It works until I replace the
ellipses with a verbatim.

Regards,

James

We are currently working with CRC and they accept author-produced
works in LaTeX. In addition, they have this to say about
author-produced material: "No Microsoft products or WordPerfect
versions may be used to prepare author-produced books."

\textperthousand

with \usepackage{textcomp} in your preamble, but not all fonts have  
the character.

Hello,

Did you try using the textcomp package?

I think \textperthousand and \textpertenthousand exist.

If this info is incorrect I have at home a copy of:
The Comprehensive LATEX Symbol List which I will be happy to consult for
you.

Alternatively you may want to google for this document which I recommend
to anyone who dabbles a bit with math or symbols at large.

Axel, hi,

thanks, I'm familiar with the aptly named former, I'll download the
latter. In the end I hacked the exercise package and after several hours
work (and a fair few working man's expletives), I whittled it down to
the following, or something very like...

+++

\ProvidesPackage{exercise}

\newbox\@allAnswerBox

\newenvironment{Answer}{%
\newbox\@thisAnswerBox%
\global\setbox\@thisAnswerBox\vbox\bgroup%
}
{%
\egroup%
\newbox\@tempAnswerBox%
\global\setbox\@tempAnswerBox\vbox{\unvbox\@allAnswerBox\unvbox\@thisAns
werBox}%
\global\setbox\@allAnswerBox\copy\@tempAnswerBox%
}

\newcommand{\shipoutAnswer}{\unvbox\@allAnswerBox}

+++

The \bgroup command gives me what I want, the contents of the Answer
environment to copy to a vbox, but I have no idea what it means, or why
I need to invoke the corresponding \egroup command.

Solving this means I've got what I want, a little exercise package of
less than twenty lines that allows me to put answer environments inside
question environments and then spit them out at the end of each chapter.
The format and numbering of the questions follows very closely the
format of theorems and definitions so it looks okay to leave them in
situ within the text. It is surprising how important the look of the
exercises turns out to be. I guess this is what typsetting is all about.

Thanks to everyone who's helped me out on this.

Kind regards,

James

If you prefer WYSIWYG, you can use GIMP

  http://www.gimp.org

For a command line tool, try ImageMagick's convert

  http://www.imagemagick.com

Alternatively, you can use pdftex which can embed JPEGs (among other
formats, but _not_ EPS).  In this case, you can use either pdftex's
primitive \pdfximage directly (see the docs) or some macro package,
for instance graphics.sty (it can be used in plain TeX with the help
of miniltx.tex) or Eplain (http://tug.org/eplain, which builds on
graphics.sty and miniltx.tex and makes them a little easier to use).

Also, especially if your drawings are lineart, you might try potrace

  http://potrace.sourceforge.net

to convert bitmaps to vector EPS/PDF -- you can then scale your
drawings to your heart's content and/or get smaller file sizes.

HTH,
Oleg

Message-ID: <DB873318D1A41648BEAC4B5AAB63B3E1137A0758@MESSAGE-AH.ad.mathworks.com>

Hello TeX Users Group,

 

I have recently been exploring TrueType implementations of Computer
Modern fonts, and am looking at the TrueType format specification.  It
is clear from the spec and from apps that dump the contents of TrueType
TTF files that there could be multiple subtables in the 'cmap' area,
where 3.1 (Microsoft Unicode), 3.0 (Microsoft Symbol), and 1.0
(Macintosh Roman) are very common.  My question is, "On various
platforms such as Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac, how does the OS decide which
encoding to use?"  For example, in Windows, if I want to add a font to
the System Font Table and specify a TTF file, how does Windows know what
'cmap' subtable to use if both 3.1 and 1.0 are included in the TTF file?
Is there a way to specify the one I want?  How do Linux/Unix and Mac do
it?  I tried to display a particular character ID for a particular Font
on a PowerPC Mac running OS X, and was surprised when the Microsoft
Unicode encoding was used rather than the Macintosh Roman.  How do Java
and XWindows play a role in this?  Finally, are there equivalent issues
on the Postscript Type1 side?  Does anyone have a good reference?  

 

Thanks very much,

Brian

A recent Wall Street Journal article suggested that TrueType font format 
and management patents were among the patent shillaleaghs that Microsoft 
intends to use to club open source software users (especially Linux 
users) into the ground.  The terms, as applied to Novell and Xandros,  
are something on the order of:  "If you pay us protection money, we 
won't kneecap your customers as they walk in your door."

Can anyone in the TeXhax community enlighten us about this matter.  If 
this is true, TTF font manipulation by TeX users with any sort of 
commercial connection is risky indeed.  It is not the same as copyright 
protection.  Even if you act in ignorance, which is entirely likely, 
since Microsoft won't specify what patents it claims are being violated, 
only that there are a lot of them, you will be crushed.

This is new. This is known:
"There are potential patent infringements in FreeType because parts of
the TrueType hinting virtual machine were patented by Apple, a fact
not mentioned in the TrueType standards. (Patent holders who
contribute to standards not published by a major standards body such
as ISO are not required to disclose the scope of their patents.)
FreeType 2 includes an automatic hinter that analyzes glyph shapes and
attempts to generate hints automatically, thus avoiding the patented
technology.[1] The automatic hinter generally improves the appearance
of free or cheap fonts, for which hinting is often either nonexistent
or automatically generated anyway, but it can degrade the appearance
of professional hand-hinted fonts, and does not work well (or at all)
for non-Western text that requires a different approach to hinting. As
a result, many people prefer to enable the patented hinting
technology." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_type)

Note that TT was developed by Apple, not Microsoft.

Also note that TT has been superseeded by OpenType, which is an ISO
standard (and as such hopefully patent free).

This is wrong. German patent law specifically covers this case: If you
claim that your product is protected by patents, you must disclose the
nature of these patents. :-) So Microsoft will never really say this,
but spread FUD.

I had not heard that Microsoft had specified any of the patents yet.

Given that concepts like BigEndian numbers and using XOR to draw cursors
have been (absurdly) patented, it is entirely plausible that Microsoft
owns plenty of patents which every program "infringes".  TrueType
manipulation sounds like a viable candidate.

    since Microsoft won't specify what patents it claims are being violated, 
    only that there are a lot of them, you will be crushed.

Well, even Microsoft, even with the stupid US legal system, can't crush
you on the basis of vague claims.  They have to bring you to court for a
specific violation.

So far it seems their campaign is basically one of increasing FUD.

I was using pdftotext today ... you could do that and then work up the
messed up places.  Beware that the order of paragraphs is sometimes
messed up!!

Subject: [texhax] How to make memoir class chapters start on both even and

Message-ID: <20070617222247.GC1446@mclink.it>

Greetings,

I am putting together a book with the simple template pasted at the
bottom. I have noticed that it makes chapters start *only* on
odd-numbered pages. Since this particular book is made of many short
chapters, I end up with a relatively high percentage of blank
pages. How should I change the template to make chapters start
indifferently on odd or even pages?

Any other comment or suggestion to improve the template is very
welcome, of course!

Thank you in advance,
	Marco

I want to write my PhD thesis in latex. But my university doesn't have
its own thesis class file. It has only a word template. Half a dozen
thesis classes, available with Miktex are not suitable for my purpose
as the university is very strict on its style sheet.

I how now decided to make a latex class file for my university and
upload it for general use. But unfortunately, I have been just a user
of latex and never a developer. I require help in turning into a
developer fast, so my request is to know

1. Whether a software tool for latex developer to develop his own class file ?
2. Are there any tutorials on how to develop your own class files.

Hi,
Check out Dr. Nicola Talbot's guide for writing PhD thesis in LaTeX:

http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/latex/thesis/thesis_a4.pdf

A search in google will provide you various class files for PhD theses
(university pages and personal pages). From my own experience, it is
easier to choose one that closely matches your university's
requirements and modify that to your need, instead of writing one from
scratch.

Also see the TeX FAQ for writing your own LaTeX classes or packages:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=writecls

See the Memoir manual, pg. 46 in the sixth edition.

Hard to make suggestions beyond that w/o knowing the text or the  
intent of the typography.

Such a file would depend either on a machine having locally installed  
versions of _all_ the fonts used, or would require a bitmap graphic  
for _every_ character not covered by the fonts installed ---  
determining which these are is left as an exercise for the reader.

Done, thanks!

You're right of course. This time, however, I have very simple needs,
so I'm almost there. The only things missing, I guess, are:

1) moving the whole type block ~1 cm higher

2) leave a bit less space between the top of the page and the chapter
   titles. What I mean is that now I see the the text starting at, say,
   3 cm from the top, except when it's a chapter start, where text
   starts at ~6 cm from the bottom and I'd like it to be a bit less (~4.5
   cm?)

I am downloading the whole manual, so pointers to the right
_variables_ to set are enough, thanks.  Comments and examples remain
very welcome, of course.

Document class option [openany] or [onesided], depending on what you want.
If you are mainly concerned with online viewing, use [onesided]; if
it is for paper printing, use [openany].

Message-ID: <D887300E-4543-4978-8C37-1C0CF272DB7F@wenlin.com>

Dear TeX typesetters,

There is a problem with the Plain TeX macro \d for adding a dot below  
a letter. Generally it works fine, but in a certain context it causes  
an error, as illustrated by the following very short TeX program:

\edef\test{\d{u}}\bye

The error message is:

------------------------------------------------------------
! Illegal parameter number in definition of \test.
<to be read again>
                    \crcr
\oalign ...z at skip \lineskip .25ex\ialign {##\crcr
                                                   #1\crcr }}
\d ...1\crcr \hidewidth \sh at ft {-1ex}.\hidewidth }
                                                   }
l.1 \edef\test{\d{u}
                     }
------------------------------------------------------------

This happens with either pdftex or just tex (running at the command  
line on OS X 10.4.9):

This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.30.4-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.5)
This is TeX, Version 3.141592 (Web2C 7.5.5)

The definition of \d is on page 356 of The TeXbook.

Any explanation, solution, or workaround will be greatly appreciated!

Best wishes,

Tom Bishop

questions and I hope you might be able to help:

1) I can't seem to start the installation.  I am only a novice Linux
user so detailed instructions on how to install what I need on my system

2) Once I install TexLive, is it only a compiler or does it also include

Any help you can give on these issues would be greatly appreciated.  Let
me know if I can provide any more information.

Why are you using \edef?  Generally it is not a good idea to fully
expand arbitrary macros.  If you have to use \d inside some other
\edef'd macro, add \noexpand in front of \d:

  \edef\test{...\noexpand\d{u}...}

The reason for the failure is obscure, but if you are curious:  \d
calls \o at lign; \o at lign calls \oalign.  When TeX was parsing \oalign,
it saw ## and converted it into a single token #.  When the
replacement text of \oalign is substituted back into the body of \d,
TeX sees this _single_ # and expects it to be followed either by
another # (which would become literal #) or by a number (which would
be replaced by an argument of \d).  TeX sees neither, therefore it
complains.

Here is a minimal example to illustrate the problem (or maybe confuse
you even more :).  \tracingall provides useful debugging info.

First, run this:

--------------------%<--------------------
\tracingall
\def\b#1{\halign{##\cr#1\cr}}% ## become #
\edef\a#1{#1\b{b}}
\a{a}
\bye
-------------------->%--------------------

TeX complains as before.  Now we put four #'s in \b:

--------------------%<--------------------
\tracingall
\def\b#1{\halign{####\cr#1\cr}}% #### become ##
\edef\a#1{#1\b{b}}
\a{a}
\bye
-------------------->%--------------------

Works, but now we can't use \b directly, because it contains two #'s
in \halign's preamble.  Now try this:

--------------------%<--------------------
\tracingall
\def\b#1{\halign{##1\cr#1\cr}}% ##1 become #1
\edef\a#1{#1\b{b}}
\a{a}
\bye
-------------------->%--------------------

Definition of \a passes, but TeX complains about the missing # in
\halign's preamble when we try to use \a.

Is there any possibility to set a background color for different rows in a 
tabular environment?

What I hope to get is ?easily done in OpenOffice for example:

Many, many thanks in advance,
Adrian

Nasty.  This shews the cause --

	\edef \test {\halign {#1\crcr \crcr}}

but I can't remember whether this is documented.

Hi,

\usepackage{colortbl}
\definecolor{myblue}{rgb}{0.8,0.85,1}
\rowcolor{myblue}

Please read the TeX FAQ or do a google search before posting.

Well they look to be Zapf Chancery-like:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{chancery}
\begin{document}
\emph{y}

$\mathcal{Z}$
\end{document}

But the ``y'' is a bit off --- looks more like Monotype Corsiva (a  
Zapf Chancery knock-off).

Check _The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List_:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols- 
letter.pdf

when in doubt, though you'll probably need to go somewhere like  
www.identifont.com to determine exactly which font was used for the  
``y''.

Just found it, I'm very impressed: it's more like an entire book, very well 
documented.

Subject: [texhax] class file vs style file
Message-ID: <4677DFA5.9030100@ametsoc.org>

In developing a template for a journal article, I'm wondering if there 
is a significant advantage to creating an entirely new class file as 
opposed to using the existing article.cls and then making any necessary 
modifications though the .sty file? The general consensus seems to be to 
create a new class file, but I guess I have not found a good explanation 
of why this is particularly advantageous.  Perhaps is just easier and 
more efficient to create the new class file? Any information you can 
provide is appreciated.

Thanks,
Brian Papa

In your example, \mathcal{Z} is taken from Computer Modern Symbol,  
because chancery.sty just redefines roman default to pzc family (the  
``y'' does come indeed from URW Chancery).

So, Jan's ``Z'' seems to me just Computer Modern calligraphy Z, but I  
have no idea either from which font his ``y'' comes from.


Best,

Axel

Thank you for all your replies,

you are correct about the use of \mathcal{} for "Z". \mathcal{} also 
produced the desired font for "Y".

So it was a capital ``Y''! I thought it was a lowercase ``y''! No  
wonder we could not figure out which font could produce that ``y''.

 From our own experience, we'd disagree: writing your own class
file is very hard.  We've found it's much easier to use a standard
class file, and apply the changes we need via our own xxx.sty file.
Here's why:

1. Changing only the bits that need to be changed is a lot less work.

2. It's usually people who are relatively inexperienced in
    LaTeX who ask this question.  (That's not a put down,
    just objective.)  But if you're a LaTeX newbie you won't
    know what you have to include in a class file to get a
    professional result.  You'll face a lot of trial and error.

3. The standard class files have had years of debugging and are
    very robust.

4. Lots of very useful packages assume that certain actions
    are performed by certain named functions ("hooks") and change the
    behavior by re-defining these functions.  If you write your
    own class file, you won't know which names you have to
    preserve.

5. Most class files use TeX code in addition to LaTeX code.
    (We have found that) TeX code is much harder to write and
    understand, or at least requires much more effort up
    front to become proficient with.

Some facts and figures: our standard style file now uses the
following 25 packages:
	babel
	caption			
	chngpage
	color
	colortbl
	courier
	crop
	endnotes
	fancyvrb
	framed
	framed
	geometry
	graphicx
	helvet
	ifthen
	latexsym
	layout
	makeidx
	mathpazo
	nextpage
	relsize
	sidecap	
	ulem
	url
	wrapfig

Ignoring comments, our additional style file contains 300
lines.  The old class file that it replaces had 850 lines,
ignoring comments.  But these figures don't tell the full story:

* The new style file has more functionality and is more
   sophisticated.

* The old class file was very difficult to maintain, not
   least because it uses lots of TeX code.

* The new style file is much simpler: most of it uses
   standard LaTeX, and a lot of that is very simple stuff
   such as:
	\newenvironment{...}
	\newcommand{...}
   to impose a consistent style, but which we could live
   without by typing a lot more in the documents being
   typeset, plus a few lines to set options for the various
   packages used.

* The new style file lets us use all the standard packages,
   which the old class file didn't.

Whichever route you go, we've found the following invaluable:

* CTAN online catalog: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/alpha.html

* "The LaTeX Companion" book, published by Addison-Wesley.

We've have got nowhere without them.

Thank you very much for the feedback.  You are right, I am fairly new to 
Latex. I've developed a template using a style file, but I've seen 
numerous people asking about developing their own class file and a few 
articles on the subject, so I was wondering if developing a new class 
(or modifying the existing article.cls) might be a better way to go. 
It sounds like using a style file is the easier route, and so far I have 
not had any problems with this method.  Thanks again.

-Brian

That really depends on how much time you want to spend
and how much you want to modify.

In my limited experience, I suggest:
style: additions to class
class: modify standards of class

I think the correct computer science word for the issue is: inheritance

Compare the size of various style files with class files.

I'm copying \firstmark or \botmark or \splitbotmark, which  
subsequently changes. I need to save the current value before it  
changes.

Thank you, I'll give that a try. In the meantime, I found a  
workaround which was to redefine \d without \halign:

\def\d#1{\leavevmode\setbox0=\hbox{#1}\dimen0=\wd0\setbox0=\hbox{.} 
\advance\dimen0 by -\wd0
	\hbox{#1\raise-0.5ex\hbox to 0pt{\hss.\kern.5\dimen0}}}%

(It doesn't do italic correction but I can't actually see the  
difference.)

Thank you also for your explanations -- I suspected it had to do with  
##.

Best wishes,

Tom

There is still one question.  Did you ask the publisher of the journal
which file formats he accepts?  If he accepts LaTeX sources he
certainly provides a class file which you should use.

I think that the first step should be to consult the publisher.

Subject: [texhax] aligned nested in a multlined nested in an align
Message-ID: <20070620234538.GA24567@zenon.in.qult.net>

Hi everybody,

It's been already a few times when I wanted to nest an aligned environment in
a multlined environment (from mathtools), itself being nested in an align
environment.  As soon as there are '&' in the aligned environment, LaTeX
complains:

  ERROR: Argument of \multlined has an extra }.

Example code:

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{mathtools}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{align}
    \begin{multlined}
      \begin{aligned}
        &a
      \end{aligned}
    \end{multlined}
  \end{align}
  \end{document}

So far, I've had to resign myself not to use that combination, but I don't see
anything that's fundamentally wrong in wanting it to work this way.

Does anybody have a solution?

Then the problem is (I suspect) in \mark's expansion of \d.  To avoid
that, you can use the trick with the toks registers:

  \toks0={\d{u}}
  \mark{\the\toks0}

Here, \mark will substitute the contents of \toks0, without any
further expansion.

You can save the marks like this:

  \expandafter\def\expandafter\savedfirstmark\expandafter{\firstmark}

or equivalently, but requiring a token register

  \toks0=\expandafter{\firstmark}
  \edef\savedfirstmark{\the\toks0}

Here again we avoid unnecessary expansion of the mark's contents.  If
you need more complex definition of \savedfirstmark, you can again use
the combination of \edef, \toks and \noexpand, for example:

  \edef\savedfirstmark{\noexpand\MacroNotToBeExpanded \the\toks0 \MacroToBeExpanded}%
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                     no expansion      one-level    full expansion
                                                       expansion

Note the space after \toks0 -- this delimits the token register's
number and is removed from the input (doesn't make it into
\savedfirstmark's definition).  Without the space, if
\MacroToBeExpanded happens to start with a digit, that digit would
become part of the token register's number.

This works around this particular problem, but similar problems are
bound to crop up later on, so it's better to fix the cause of the
problem.

Hi,

My name is Eva Goldman, I am an executive editor of the Israel Journal  
of Mathematics.

We are currently working with an outdated package written the 80's  
specifically for this journal. (We use no \theoremstyle definitions,  
and not even list environments, all the enumeration is done manually.)

We want to change this situation, to be able to work with the usual  
Latex packages and environments. However, this has to be done without  
changing the appearance of the journal (in particular page dimensions,  
the layout of environments e.g. of theorem, definition,
enumeration, ...).

So I was thinking of using amsart instead, and somehow changing the  
required dimensions and definitions (by using an own package).

Could you direct me to somebody who would be willing to help me with this?
We would be able to provide some payment for this (although we still  
have to clarify the details).

Sincerely,
Eva Goldman

Hi,

I'm trying to change the way citations are presented in my thesis class 
(which loads class 'report' as a base). Right now citations in the dvi 
file are in parens. So
"The sky is blue \cite{blah}"  in the latex file becomes  "The sky is 
blue (2)" in the compiled doc and I want it to be "The sky is blue [2]"  
instead. I've looked in the bst file, the report.cls, even the latex.ltx 
file, and can't figure it out.

Does anyone know?

BTW, I'm using bibtex, not doing \bibitem in the latex file.

Thanks

Beverley Eyre

You might want to take a look at

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?keyword=bibliographic+citation

or, if you use Linux or Mac OS (I don't know about Windows), in your  
terminal application:

texdoc natbib

Of course, within minutes of sending this I found tugboat.def on the

working. Is this where the file should go? Surely there must have been
some more user-friendly way to solve this problem.

Well, first of all, it's nothing to do with BibTeX, that merely creates the
list, but cannot affect the way \cite & co behave.

Now, you say you looked in "the report.cls, even the latex.ltx", but what
about the "thesis class" you mention.  You don't mention whether you load any
style files.  Without this information, we can't help.  However, I suspect
that it is indeed your thesis class and that this is the desired behaviour.

Folks,

Is there a way to typeset to ledger sized (11 by 17) paper?

I see dvipdfm can output to that size paper, 
but I want more columns available,
not just a larger (up-scaled) printout.

Would dvipdfm (or pdflatex) be able to convert the dvi to pdf?

Ah yes, I see. Best thing to do is to contact the author... Oh wait,
that's me. :-)

Fixing the problem is relatively simple given that one knows which
dirty trick to use. Place the following in your preamble and it'll fix
the problem.

\MHInternalSyntaxOn

\renewenvironment{multlined}[1][]{
  \MT_test_for_tcb_other:nnnnn {#1}
    {\def\MT_mult_default_pos:{#1}}
    {\def\MT_mult_default_pos:{#1}}
    {\def\MT_mult_default_pos:{#1}}
    {
      \if_meaning:NN \@empty#1\@empty
      \else:
        \setlength \l_MT_multwidth_dim{#1}
      \fi:
    }
    \iffalse{\fi\ifnum0=`}\fi % added
    \MT_multlined_second_arg:w
  }
  {
    \hfilneg  \endaligned
    \ifnum0=`{\fi\iffalse}\fi % added
  }

\MHInternalSyntaxOff


The latter \iffalse ... \fi can be shortened even more but this way
there is at least a small chance you will keep your sanity. See
Appendix D of The TeXbook for more on this.

I will fix this in the source.

Hi!
I have a problem a problem using the description environment: when the label is long, I would like it to be written on two lines.
I tried to show what I would like to get in the following example.

\documentclass[english]{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage{babel}
\begin{document}
\begin{description}
\item[This is a really long label, and I would like it to be written on two lines, and appear in bold, as the described item]but it won't! :(
\item[I cheated] on the next one:
\item[]\textbf{This is a really long label, and I would like it to be written on two lines, and appear in bold, as the described item} (that's what I would like to get, without cheating, and without and indent)!
\end{description}
\end{document}

Message-ID: <9c42bc7f0706220715i7d7e73e0wc33e37e64226e756@mail.gmail.com>

Hello TUG

I have a problem, and I cannot find any answer to it in your faq, nor
anywhere
else on the internet. My problem is this:

I want to create a LaTeX-document with the same header on every page
(including the first page). The body-text on pages 2, 3, 4 and onwards
seem to adjust correctly to the size of the header. But the body-text on
page 1 does not adjust to the size of the header. The bodytext is placed
a certain length away from the top of the page, regardless if it means that
body and header collides. It looks quite ridiculous...

Can you help me find out what I can do to make the first-page text adjust to
the
size of the header?



Here is a sample document, that shows my problem. Just compile and
watch the output :)

\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{book}

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\fancyhead[OL,EL]{Headertext \\Headertext \\Headertext \\Headertext \

Message-ID: <20070624150708.GA4459@mclink.it>

Greetings,

first of all, thanks to all who answered to my question "How to make
memoir class chapters start on both even and odd pages?".

Now, I have the latex source with lots of subsections and
chapters. The table of contents already shows titles and page numbers
of all the numbered \chapters.

What I would like to do is to also show in the table of contents title
and page number of the two non-numbered section/subsections shown here
with the SPECIAL word (all the other sections/subsections don't need
to be listed in the ToC):

\section*{first SPECIAL subsection}
\subsection*{generic subsection}
\subsection*{second SPECIAL subsection}
\subsection*{another generic subsection}
\chapter{the first chapter}
\subsubsection*{generic subsection of first chapter}
\chapter{the second chapter}
 
The template I'm using is below. Any feedback and pointer is appreciated.

Thank you in advance,

	Marco

Marco,

You can always add it manually, e.g.:

...
\section*{first SPECIAL subsection}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{first SPECIAL subsection}
...

You may also have a look at \addtocontents line if you don't want the
text to appear as a real contents (e.g., with page numbers, etc.).

Is this what you were after? [It's standard latex]

Yes, this is it, thanks. As a matter of fact (blushing) I had already
found that instructions but for typos and other reasons I can't fathom
right now it didn't work, so I thought it was uncompatible with Memoir
in some way...

Thanks again

Subject: [texhax] Memoir class ToC starts arabic numbering one page too late
Message-ID: <20070624160618.GC4459@mclink.it>

Greetings,

the template below produce an unforeseen (for me) effect: Title,
author and Toc take 3.5 pages. However, only the first three pages are
numbered i, ii, iii. The 4th page, instead of being numbered "iv", is
where the arabic numbering starts, that is it is numbered "1". Why? I
thought that the options in that template would make arabic numbering
start from the fifth page.

Note: if I uncomment the \pagebreak statement, arabic numbering does
start from the fifth page, but the ToC entries are spread at equal
intervals in the fourth page, to fill it top to bottom (which is ugly,
isn't it? I'd like to have the same spacing of the previous ToC pages
there)

Thank you in advance,

	Marco

Subject: [texhax] shifting the typeblock up in Memoir template
Message-ID: <20070624162321.GD4459@mclink.it>

Hello, it's me again. Hopefully this could be the last time I bother
the list for a while.

The typeblock created with the template below is fine as far as its
size is concerned, but it is too low on the page. It starts very close
to the bottom edge of the sheet, leaving too much white space at the
top. What is the way to leave every other parameter as is but just
shift the whole typeblock 1 or 2 cm up? I *am* reading the memoir
manual right now, but frankly all the options I've found so far seem
to do more than that.

Thank you again for your patience and time.

Correcting the template as below, that is moving clearpage at the
right position, made the trick. Many thanks to the list members who

Since I got my TeXLive discs three months ago I managed to install  
TeX on my iMac. but it won't install on my Win98 platform.   At  
present my problem is that I can't find any fonts.  I found a two  
sheet document listing some 65 odd fonts that are supposed to come  
with Latex - but I have no idea where they are or if I can use them  
with plain TEX ?  Are they on one of the discs? - what's the file  
name ?, are they zipped, do I have to un-zip them & how does one do  
that on a Mac? Also, where should fonts be installed (surely not in  
the Mac font library)?  Please advise !
	Is there anyone in the Dallas area that I  I could actually talk to  
about TeX problems, perhaps there's a "user group" around here?
	Or maybe I should try OzTeX - it sounds a simpler implementation -  
even if its no longer supported- does that make sense?
	Any assistance will be appreciated - thanks  _ John Stevens

I have is 2.6.2639. When I print a document and specify only certain pages

 From what I understand here, your problem seems to be with your  
Windows installation.

But here it seems you have a problem with your Mac installation. I  
this is the case, I would advise you to subscribe to the TeX on Mac  
OS X mailing list:

http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/main.shtml#Mailinglist

> Also, where should fonts be installed

The MacTeX installer

http://www.tug.org/mactex/

should take care of that for you. It installs fonts in

/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/fonts/

But fonts need map files that are installed elsewhere. If you want to  
post your problem to the TeX on Mac mailing list (or in this very  
list), please provide a minimal example of what *doesn't* work; like  
for example, if you want Palatino and this doesn't work:

\documentclass{minimal}
\usepackage{mathpazo}
\begin{document}
Hello! $a + b = c$
\end{document}


Best,

Axel

So sorry! My bad for not paying attention! Well, yes, fonts are in

/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/fonts

I don't really know Plain TeX, but for example, to use Times I call  
the font with its .tfm name:

\font\Times=ptmr8r

\Times Hello!

\bye

and it works. Look into this directory:

/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/

Best,

Hello, smart TeXers.  I have a two part question, one for LaTeX, and another more generally for typsetting.

What's the technical term for the second title -- the bit occupied by "or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb"?  I thought of second title, subtitle, epigram, none of them are quite it.  Other example (from the two books closest by me):

New Spirits -- American from 1865 - 1905

and 

The gilded Age -- a history in documents.

I'm interested in the second bit.

Second question.  How do I represent that part of the title in LaTeX?  I tried \subtitle but of course that didn't work.  Should I just consider it a part of the title?  like:

\title{New Spirits \\
America from 1865 - 1905}

That doesn't give me quite the effect I'm looking for.

FYI, I'm using amsbook, but I'd think a solution from book or memoir would suffice, too.

Thank you,

Robert

I have a strange problem: the same author's name appears in different

Doe (etc). Then bibliographystyle alpha would list J. Doe first
(sorting by year), then J. W. Doe, etc.

* Is there any way to tell LaTeX that this is the same author (without
replacing all these names by one)?

* Is there a bibliographystile which sorts by year, author rather than
by author, year as alpha doe?

I'm guessing you're using BibTeX.  There's a nice trick in item 13 on
<http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/local-docs/btxdocs/btxdoc/btxdoc/node8.html#SECTION00040000000000000000>,
which amounts to putting these in the database with

author="J[oe W.] Doe"
author="Joe[ W.] Doe"
author="J[oe] W. Doe"
author="Joe W. Doe"

respectively.

> * Is there a bibliographystile which sorts by year, author rather than

There's a package on CTAN called custom-bib.  With this package, you
LaTeX a particular file, LaTeX interactively asks you a bunch of
questions about what you want your bibliography to be like, and it
creates a bibliography style based on your answers.  One of the
questions it asks is whether you want references to be sorted by

Hi there,
 
I am trying to create a presentation using Beamer. I use WinEDT as my
TeX editor and run the job using MikTeX on a Windows box. Uusally the
program compiled smoothly. Today, it is asking for a lot of .sty files.
I downloaded most of them. But there is bibtex.sty that I can't find
anywhere. I searched CTAN and googled it, but I have not found the .sty
file. 
 
Can you please help me?
 
Thanks,
 
Mohammad R. Jahan-Parvar

 Hi,

Sorry for the incomplete earlier message.

I am writing a thesis using the files provided at my institution, but the default is \bibliography{plain} which produces numbered references. I want my references to appear as in astronomy journals, in author, year format. I have tried using chicago.bst and aas.bst but that does not produce the exact form I want. (author, year with no square brackets around it). What else can I try?

Thanks,
Sally

Read natbib.pdf. It should be in the doc section of your distribution.

The regular LaTeX classes don't have \subtitle, and I don't think memoir
does, either.  I made one by redefining the \title command once, like
this:

 \def\iffull#1{\if#1\relax\else}
 \gdef\@subtitle{}
 \def\subtitle#1{\gdef\@subtitle{#1}}
 \def\title#1{\gdef\@title{\sectfont\bfseries\LARGE#1\iffull\@subtitle\\%
      \mdseries\Large\@subtitle\fi}}

\sectfont would have to be defined to use this verbatim.  But you get
the idea: you have to redefine the construction of your title page
somehow to include the \@subtitle.  In the above, I glommed it into the
\title definition, which wasn't really such a nice way to do it.  Better
would be to redefine \maketitle to do what you want, using \@subtitle.
Look in the class you're using for the definitions of \maketitle, and
you'll see what's going on.  Copy that into your document, or your own
style file, and change it a bit at a time until it looks like what you
want.

If you read my code carefully, you'll see that this is exactly the same
as my solution.  The only real difference is that I've provided a
\subtitle macro, which seemed to me more in the spirit of LaTeX's
functional markup.  I did this for a set of documents that were also to
be converted to html, so defining the look of the page wasn't as
important as defining the roles that each bit of text had to play.

I haven't tried, but it seems really good. You might want to take a  
look at the documentation:

There is a Beamer mailing list:

Maybe they can tell you what's happening (I can't find any bibtex.sty  
either).

This bug has been reported a while ago. It seems the MikTex team has 
been so busy trying to stabilize new versions, that simple (?) problems 
such as this one haven't been fixed. We updated one of our computers a 
while ago and ran into the bug. The rest have been left at version 2.4 
rather than face all of the problems. Unfortunately, it is not easy to 
roll back MikTex versions because the load/update from repository have 
been turned off for the older versions.

Thank you.  I didn't think of redefining \maketitle.  I'll look at that 
now.  For the sake of disclosure, this seemed to give me something like 
what I was wanting:

\title[Taking Sides]{Taking Sides \\
{\large \textbf{Theory and Issues in Political and Moral Philosophy}}}

Thanks again,

Robert

I have had the same problem with YAP 2.5.2574 already. 
There also is an entry for both versions on the MiKTeX bugs data base headed 
'yap ignores the "To:" part of the page range to print' 
(indeed, if you don't stop it "manually", YAP prints on and on until the 
document's last page) from March and April, without answer. 
The problem has been on the MiKTeX mailing list as well, 
but I was unable to open archive files. 
Right now, I have other strange experiences with sourceforge.net ... 

Workaround: I use the "cancel" button in YAP's report box to stop it. 
An error report "unexpected condition" pops up -- don't mind, 
ignore it. You must "cancel" at least not before the printer ejects 
the first page.

Hi~

I'm trying to insert footnotes inside a picture and so far it isn't
working.  I've tried various combinations of \footnotemark and \footnote
text, with [number] but the numbers aren't incrementing correctly AND
the footnotes aren't showing up at the bottom of the page with the other
footnotes.  I have text with footnotes before and after the picture so,
I want them to just appear in the same list, with the next number in the
sequence.

What am I missing? 

Thanks!

Charla

Help!!!
  I?ve been charged with the re-writing of the PC LaTeX6 users guide and would like to hear some suggestions from users. How could the guide better help the needs of new and advanced users alike? 
  Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Maybe the manyfoot package (part of the ncctools collection) could  
help you.

Message-ID: <46828BFB.6050203@binghamton.edu>

Running MikTeX on WinXP.  Having a problem getting editor's name to show
up in my bibliography.

Here is my preamble (there is some leftover junk from another journal's
house template, which I've commented out:

I am using a custom bst file I made with custom bib.  However, for
illustrative purposes, I tried compiling it with unsrt style, so you
could see what the error messages were, and that they were not due to my
custom style:

\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
\bibliography{C:/DATA/scholar/ADHDconstipation/ADHDconstipationreferences}




And here are the error messages.  I get the same error with my custom
bst file:

This is BibTeX, Version 0.99c (MiKTeX 2.4)
The top-level auxiliary file: DutchEFPjpgn_article.aux
The style file: unsrt.bst

(There were 3 warnings)

The two problematic bibtex entries, TPWS and Okkes2003, are here (the
middle warning, about chapter and pages, does not concern me; I'd like
to solve the first and third, if possible):

@INBOOK{TPWS,

No, definitely not. I know manyfoot's internals. The extra smart macros
you need rather are table etc. macros than footnote macros.
(They may redefine \footnote such that the footnote text is stored in a hook
that eventually will execute \footnotetext's.)
Cf. the UK FAQ on footnotes in tables and in captions:

     http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=footintab

     http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=ftncapt

Here is workaround for the problem of more than one footnote
"in a prison":

\newcounter{save}
\newcommand{\transferto}[2]{\setcounter{#2}{\value{#1}}}
\newcommand{\stepfootnotetext}{\stepcounter{footnote}\footnotetext}

Alpha\footnote{alpha}
\transferto{footnote}{save}
\begin{tabular}{c}
A\footnotemark\\B\footnotemark
\end{tabular}
\transferto{save}{footnote}
\stepfootnotetext{a}
\stepfootnotetext{b}
Omega\footnote{omega}

I also have some private macros using labels to find the
correct footnote number. And it appears to me that I found
a much smarter package of this kind somewhere else.
But right now it comes to my mind that I rather should
generalize the hook thing -- but I must stop here.

According to Charla Mustard-Foote, manyfoot has worked for his  
purposes; but your macro below is, as usual, so ingeniously simple,  
that I'll keep it around as the jewel it is (hope one day I could do  
that!).

Axel

You might benefit from putting these things in the bibliographic
database as @INCOLLECTION records instead of @INBOOK records.  There's
a brief summary of the differences between the two record types at
<http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/local-docs/btxdocs/btxdoc/btxdoc/node6.html#SECTION00031000000000000000>.

Message-ID: <KNECIPCGPOMFIMJPOANMGENJCAAA.hodenius@hia.rwth-aachen.de>

Dear Mms./Sirs,

I need a command to change the style of references in my LateX dokument.
E.g. I want to delete the numbers [1], [2] and so on, i.e. I want to replace
for example:
[1] Bulte J, De Cuyper M, Despres D and Frank J 1999 {\it J. Magn. Magn.
Mater.} {\bf 194} 204-209.
by
Bulte J, De Cuyper M, Despres D and Frank J 1999 {\it J. Magn. Magn. Mater.}
{\bf 194} 204-209.

Can you help me ?

Much thanks in advance.

Kind regards,

Michael Hodenius.

Well, did you install gcc?

Why do you want to compile dvipng yourself? Either get it from your
distribution or get TeXLive 2007.

Subject: [texhax] How to add book parts names in table of contents?
Message-ID: <20070628221101.GB4161@mclink.it>


Hello,

I have a book which is divided in several parts:

Part 1: general

	Chapter 1: title of chapter 1
	Chapter 2: " "  "  "  "    2
        ...
	Chapter 8: " "  "  "  "    8

Part 2: something else

	Chapter 9: title of chapter 9
	...
        Chapter 15: title of chapter 15

Part 3: another part
	Chapter 16: title of chapter 16

etc etc...

How can I add the "Part N" numbers and titles in the right places in
the initial Table of Contents? I don't need them to appear _between
chapters, only in the ToC. Is it possible? How?

Thanks,
	Marco

Try something along the lines of

      \addcontentsline{toc}{part}{\thepart\hspace{1em}My part title}%

where each part starts.  If you don't actually use the \part command, you'll
also need to add 

      \refstepcounter{part}%

before each insertion.  Oh, and you will need to be using the book class.

Cheers,  Phil

Thanks. I have to leave for about an hour now, but will try and report
as soon as I'm back. In the meantime, I forgot to tell I'm using the
Memoir class but I assume it's the same, isn't it?

I've always used natbib (the package to customize references inside  
your text) with makebst (the program to make your own style for your  
bibliography); read their documentation ---they should be in your  
distribution. makebst is not as hard to use as it seems ---basically,  
you run it with

latex makebst

in a terminal and answer a bunch of questions. The worst that can  
happen is that you make a mistake and have to start all over again.

Now ---there is biblatex:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/exptl/biblatex/

I haven't tried yet, but seems really good.

Best,

Axel

One minor correction:  of course, the space after \the\toks0 is
present in \savedfirstmark's definition; what I meant was that it is
removed from the _output_, i.e., it is not typeset.

Are you /sure/ ?  Here is my test case :

	\toks 0 = {[ABC 123 def]}
	\def \MacroNotToBeExpanded {[\oalign]}
	\def \MacroToBeExpanded {[\space A\space \the \toks 0 ]}
	\edef\savedfirstmark{\noexpand\MacroNotToBeExpanded \the\toks0 \MacroToBeExpanded}
	\message {\meaning \savedfirstmark}
	\toks 0 = \expandafter {\savedfirstmark}
	[\the \toks 0  ]
	\end

->

Sorry, my bad -- I should have reread that message twice, as too much
time passed.  Of course, because \savedfirstmark is \edef'd, the space
after \the\toks0 is removed during the expansion.  My correction
should apply to a \def'd macro, like Philip's \MacroToBeExpanded --
the space after 0 _is_ there in the macro, but is removed when the
macro is expanded/typeset (so it is not in the _expansion_ of
\MacroToBeExpanded and not in \savedfirstmark).

Sorry for the blunder, and thanks for catching it,

    due to this I am not able to progress any further please advice what
    to, if we have dvipng already part of the install how do I check for
    this in my install

If you followed the "quickinstall" instructions, you should have all the
packages, and thus it should be installed as bin/i386-linux/dvipng under
your TL root directory.  That is, if you're on i386-linux.  Whatever
kind of system ...

You should add /your/tl/root/bin/i386-linux (or whatever) to your PATH,
if you haven't already.

Subject: [texhax] vertical alignement of mutlirow cell
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0706291852380.12329@dizzy.medphys.ucl.ac.uk>


Hello,

Sorry to bother everyone with this apparently simple question, but is it
possible to set the vertical alignment of a multirow cell?

I have the following table:

\ctable[caption= Proposed root-channel correspondence for the SLARSI.,
label=tab:slarsiChan ]
{ccp{6cm}}
{}
{
\FL
Channel	& Root & Actions \ML
1 	& L3L 	& \multirow{2}{6cm}{thigh flexion, adduction and rotation
(hip);  leg extension (knee).} \NN
2 	&\vspace{4pt}L3R 	&  \NN % put the vspace there to actually
get space between this line and the next
3  & L4L 	&  \multirow{2}{6cm}{thigh flexion, adduction and rotation
(hip); leg extension (knee); foot flexion, inversion and toe
extension.}\NN
4 	&\vspace{15pt}L4R 	&  \NN
5 	& L5L 	&  \multirow{2}{6cm}{thigh extension and rotation (hip);
leg flexion (knee); foot flexion, ankle and toe movements.}\NN
6 	&\vspace{15pt}L5R 	&  \NN
7	& S1L 	&  \multirow{2}{6cm}{thigh extension and rotation (hip);
leg flexion (knee); foot flexion, ankle and toe movements.} \NN
8	&\vspace{10pt}S1R	&  \NN
9 	& S2L - S2R 	& thigh extension and rotation (hip); leg flexion
(knee); foot plantar flexion, ankle inversion and toe flexion; light
gluteal stimulation and erection. \NN
10	& S3L - S3R - S4L - S4R 	& leg flexion (knee); foot plantar
flexion and toe movements; bladder and bowel emptying. \LL
}

If you latex it (need ctable package) please add the line
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{4pt} in your intro to replicate mine.
I need the extra row height to include subscripts in cells.

I would like to align the multirow cell so that the text starts in line
with the first cell that it spans instead of centering the text in the
vertical middle of the multirow cell.

If you have an alternative layout for the table please feel free to
suggest anything, I just can't get this table to look right.

Many thanks for your help

The basic answer is probably in the FAQ -- redefine \@biblabel (which
exists specifically for changing the bibitem tags).  

The trick, though, is getting rid of the indentation.  

\makeatletter
\renewcommand\@biblabel[1]{\hspace{-\labelsep}}
\makeatother

The original poster should try \usepackage{natbib} in the preamble of the
document, and \bibliographystyle{plainnat} in the body. All \cite commands
should be changed into one of the natbib commands, such as \citet, \citep,
\citeauthor, and \citeyear.

Could use some help getting this thing going.
I downloaded the LaTex for mac os x with the i-installer and tried  
writing equations with LaTexit, but it won't convert simple text--  
nothing happens.  Is there a switch somewhere I'm missing?

LaTeXiT has four tabs: Eqnarray, Display, Inline and Text. If you  
only want to typeset text, select the Text tab; if you want text  
within math mode (the first 3 tabs), you have to use the \text{...}  
command:

\text{Hi!}\ a + b = c

Best,

Axel

>From the Apple's web page on LaTeXit:

http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/math_science/latexit.html

System Requirements

   * Mac OS X 10.4 or later
   * Working pdflatex, latex, dvipdf and Ghostscript (gs)
   * Mac OS X 10.3 Panther compatible version available from publisher

Have you tried using latex, dvips or dvipdf commands from the terminal
first to check if your installation is complete/alright, before using
LaTeXit ?
