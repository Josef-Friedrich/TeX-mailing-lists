Subject: [texhax] Tabular, cline and column spacing
Message-ID: <20070801094628.GA29393@zenon.in.qult.net>

Hi texhaxers,

I stumbled across a pretty annoying problem with the preamble of tabular.

Suppose I want to typeset a table with three columns, vertical lines but a
horizontal line covering only the second column.  This is easy:

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \cline{2-2}
    a & b & c
  \end{tabular}

But now suppose I want to have more space around the vertical line between
columns 2 and 3.  Obviously, that's what @{...} are for:

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c@{\qquad}|@{\qquad}c|}
    \cline{2-2}
    a & b & c
  \end{tabular}

but something's wrong with the horizontal line here.  It is as though whatever
you put in an @{...} suppresses intercolumn space and goes at the end of the
preceding column.

In this very example, if you replace the second @{\qquad} by a >{\qquad}, it
seems to work, but as soon as the column type is p{}, m{} or b{} (or X in
a tabularx) it doesn't.

Does anybody have a solution to that?

Since I'm certainly not the first person with this problem, I prefer to ask on
this list before diving into the frightening world of LaTeX's internals. =)

Yes.

Quick and nasty (note the doubled && - a fake column):

  \begin{tabular}{|c|c@{\qquad}|c@{\qquad}c|}
    \cline{2-2}
    a & b && c
  \end{tabular}

I don't understand what you mean by it doesn't work for >{\qquad} with
column type p{}, ...

Yeah ok.  Thanks.

I mean that if you put a p{...} instead of a c in the third column and a
>{\qquad} instead of the second @{\qquad}, then it does not add a \qquad space
to between the line and the content, as the stuff inside a >{...} goes at the
beginning inside the parbox, not before it.

I was hoping to be able to use minitoc \secttoc 
with my sugconf.cls which is an extension of the article class.

I am using \usepackage{hyperref} within MyPaper.tex
 
When I add \usepackage{minitoc}
I get strange errors reporting missing { in section commands

I have tryed 
\usepackage{minitoc} both before and after \hyperref
but neither works.

is it possible to combine these two packages minitoc and hyperref?

Hello, I was wondering if there was an rsync path on the tug.org server that
corresponds to the source of the 2007 TeXLive DVD. I am aware of
tug.org::tldevsrc but whereas that corresponds to the svn trunk of the
development tree, I am looking to access the 2007.0 tag directory of that
repository via rsync. Any information is greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

I am using plain tex. However thanks for the suggestion, I
have read the doc of manyfoot and this issue was discussed,
so I will rewrite my macros to use latex and give it
manyfoot a try.

Another related question please: I read from bigfoot doc
that it has some improvements over manyfoot, however I
cannot force it to typeset footnotes into paragraphs. With
simple test files it seems to work ok, howerver when there
are many long footnotes, then they are typeset in the
"classical" latex way. A minimal test file would look as:

,--------
| \documentclass{report}
| \usepackage{bigfoot}
|
| \DeclareNewFootnote[para]{default}
| \begin{document}
| text \footnote{some note some note some note some note some
| note some note some note some note some note} \input{tufte}
| text \footnote{some note some note some note some note some
| note some note some note some note some note} \input{tufte}
| text \footnote{some note some note some note some note some
| note some note some note some note some note} \input{tufte}

Hi list,

When you pdflatex your .tex file and it contained some errors, you  
get the message "No file written to disk", *and* any previously  
generated PDF is removed. Is there anyway to prevent the PDF from  
being deleted? I couldn't find anything about this while it seems  
rather important!

My specific problem is when you want to have your viewer look  
automatically for changes on the PDF: some of them work on the file  
itself, and not its name/path (as most well written Mac  
applications). So as soon as you have an error, the viewer looses  
track of the file, and you loose the autolook capabilities, and have  
to start everything all over again...

Any help?

Thanks,

Alexandre

If the incomplete file wasn't deleted, the viewer would try to open it

Hello,

I need to format something like this (whitespace-formatted here):

   x (x + 1) = 0
=> x_1 = 0
       x + 1 = 0
=> x_2 = -1

This is quite a stupid example, but the first and the third line are
supposed to be aligned (equal signs below each other), whereas the
second and the fourth line are not supposed to influence the alignment,
so it should _not_ look like:

            x (x + 1) = 0
=> x_1 = 0
                x + 1 = 0
=> x_2 = -1

In a table, the command for this would be `multicolumn'.  Is there
anything similar for align'ed equations?


Thank you

Hi Dieter,

    though it may sound strange: could you kindly provide the exact
    command you use to create the iso-image with mkisofs?

mkisofs -pad -J -dir-mode 0755 -r -o whatever.iso .

Well, there are more options to exclude certain files in the source
tree, depending on which iso is being made, but I doubt that will matter
for you.  The actual script is at
http://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/tools/MakeImages.sh?view=log

    I am currently integrating a sparc64-linux binary set 

Are you aware that TL already comes with sparc-linux binaries?
The system was, I believe, Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 (Sarge),
kernel 2.4.27-2-sparc64.

Happy TeXing and ISOing too :).

Will this do?

\(\setlength{\arraycolsep}{0pt}
   \begin{array}{rr@{\;}l}
                 & x(x + 1) & = 0\\
     \Rightarrow & \multicolumn{2}{l}{x_1=0}\\

I've used sfmath.sty

http://dtrx.de/od/tex/sfmath.html

with it, \( \mathbf{X} \) typesets fine. There is also sansmath.sty,

The `array' command is exactly what I was looking for, thank you
(especially for the quick reply).

Is there any reason to prefer either `array' or `align' in cases where
they would both do the job?

With the array package. See it's documentation ---if you use Linux or  
Mac, use the command

texdoc array

in your terminal.

I would recommend also the LaTeX Primer, by TUG India (p. 70):

{%                            % inside a group, so it only affects TOC
\addtolength{\hoffset}{0.5in} % additional 1/2in, but reduces right  
margin
\setlength\textwidth{4.27in}  % this only adjusts the running head
\hsize 4.27in%                % TeX, more than LaTeX, but adjusts TOC  
text
\tableofcontents\clearpage}%  % \clearpage works like \par, so last page
                               % of TOC typesets OK

4.27in I got it from the usual \textwidth of ten point LaTeX classes:

345pt/72.27 = 4.77... inch, minus 0.5 inch = 4.27in. Adjust as  
necessary.

Hi,
 I have been using PSTricks for graphics in my texts. I have been using Timothy Van Zandt's User's guide. On page 76 of this guide there is article 38 about typesetting text along a path. I tried his instructins but nothing works. He says that it works with Rokicki's dvips. I do not what it is ( I am not much into computor jargons) and how to obtain and use it. Can I get some help?
I use windows and the software I installed and use is called WinEdt(2).

Isn't it a little bit old? I would advise you to check The Indian TUG  
tutorial:

http://sarovar.org/projects/pstricks/

Chapter 9, ``Tricks with text'' is, I think, what you're looking for;  
but all chapters are worth reading (and you can download both the PDF  
with the chapter as well as the source code).

WinEdt is really a front-end to an actual TeX distribution, which  
might be, in your case, MikTeX or TeXLive, right?

I see in WinEdt's web site snapshots that it has a button ``dvi- 
 >ps''; that runs dvips, after you have run TeX or LaTeX. Then there  
is another button ``ps->pdf'' ---if you run that too it will create a  
PDF you can view with Acrobat Reader, for example.

Axel

Message-ID: <DB873318D1A41648BEAC4B5AAB63B3E11446D58A@MESSAGE-AH.ad.mathworks.com>

Hello All,

I wonder whether any of you have seen this or I am following an incorrect 
installation procedure for the Bluesky CM/PS Fonts on the Macintosh.

I downloaded cmps-textures.hqx from 
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bluesky/ in order to 
examine the Computer Modern Fonts and LaTeX Fonts in standard Macintosh Type 
1 format.  I have repeated the following experiment on two Macintosh 
computers, with the following info:

Macintosh #1: Mac OS X, Version 10.3.8
Processor: Dual 1 GHz PowerPC G4
Memory: 1 GB DDR SDRAM

Macintosh #2: Mac OS X, Version 10.4.9
Processor: 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo
Memory: 2 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM

I unpacked cmps-textures.hqx into "CM/PS for Textures.sit" and used StuffIt 
to expand "CM/PS for Textures.sit" into the three directories "AFM", "CM PS 
outlines", and "CM screen".

In the directory "CM screen" were the two files "CM/PS screen fonts" and 
"LaTeX screen fonts", each in FFIL format with the appropriate icon.

In the directory "CM PS outlines" were a total of 94 font files (such as 
CMR10, CMSY10, ., LASY8.), each in LWFN format with the appropriate icon.

I copied both FFIL files from "CM screen" and the 94 LWFN files from "CM PS 
outlines" to the Library/Font subdirectory of my user home directory.

I rebooted the computer, and logged in with my user id, and opened up "Font 
Book".

In the "All Fonts" category, I now see both the "Computer Modern" and 
 "LaTeX" font families, as I had hoped.

However, when I expand the "Computer Modern" font family, I see the 
following list, where "Plain" is repeated 80 times (75 times for the CM* 
fonts and 5 times for the LOGO* fonts):

        Computer Modern
                Plain
                Plain
                Plain
                ...
                Plain

When I expand the "LaTeX" font family, I see the following list (note that 
there should be 14 LaTeX fonts):

        LaTeX
                LCIRCLEW10
                LINEW10
                LASY10
                LASYB10
                LCIRCLE10
                LINE10
                Plain
                Plain
                Plain
                Plain
                Plain

When I click on each of the 80 fonts under "Computer Modern", the preview 
pane looks correct (I see the Sample, Repertoire, or Custom previews 
correctly), and the name of each font appears correctly below the preview 
pane.  When I double-click on each of the 80 fonts under "Computer Modern", 
the dialog that pops up indicates that the font is "installed" but shows a 
style of "Plain".

It seems as though there is some corruption, or perhaps the Style field of 
each font is set to "Plain" rather than its name.  The problem is that when 
I call GetAllFonts in my Java AWT GraphicsEnvironment, all of the Computer 
Modern Plain fonts are considered duplicates, and so only one of them (the 
first alphabetically) is available to my Java apps.

I am stumped.  Do you have any idea what may be wrong?

Thanks and best regards,

Wouldn't you prefer to install the OpenType Latin Modern fonts?:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/lm/fonts/opentype/public/lm/

You can place them in a single folder and put this in /Library/fonts

Subject: [texhax] How to suppress subfloat label
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0708091358230.5295@plaza.301south.net>

Hello all,

I am using the subfig package to insert subfigures in a document.  I would 
like one of my figures to contain both a long caption and a short caption, 
so that the long caption appears beneath the figure but the short caption 
appears in the List of Figures.  My code looks like this:

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subfloat[ ... very long caption ... ]{\includegraphics...}
  \caption{A short, manageable caption.}
  \label{foo}
\end{figure}

This renders as follows:

          -----------------

               graphics

          -----------------
          (a) ... very long
          caption .......

Figure 1: A short, manageable caption.

My question: is there any way to suppress the "(a)" subfigure label at the 
beginning of the subfloat caption?  I would like to do this just for one 
subfigure, not globally.

Thanks in advance!

-Brandon

I think I sent my reply to the wrong address, so if this is a double post I
am sorry. It will not happen again, I promise. :)

Hello Hans,

    The disk-image you supply at
    http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX.dmg seems to be corrupt.

The original MacTeX.dmg image is OK, really. The likely culprit is that
the large file was corrupted during the download. You can choose a CTAN
mirro explicitly by downloading via this url:

   http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX.dmg

A printed list is available at
   http://ctan.org/tex-archive/README.mirrors

(Also, if you use ftp explicitly, be sure to transfer the file in binary
mode.)

Hope this helps,
Karl

I fear that a template file doesn't help very much.  It is better to
read

   http://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf

If you really need a template, try this one:
____________________________________________
\documentclass{book}
\begin{document}
\chapter{foo}
Some text.
\chapter{bar}
Some other text.
\section{foobar}
Hello!
\end{document}
____________________________________________

... but I'm sure that it doesn't help very much.

If you want to use LaTeX you have to read some documentation first.
If you already used LaTeX you should tell us which problems you have
with \documentclass{book}.

Regards,
  Reinhard

According to Chicago Manual of Style

http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html

a book has several parts: front, main, back

Due to production considerations,
i.e., that FrontMatter is written after the body of the book
and has roman numerals paging,
document class book has commands 
\frontmatter and
\backmatter
for changing page numbering.

Below is a template that I have developed.

Does this answer your Q?

I am in despair. 

I am writing a book in LaTex, and have already 239 pages, and, unfortunately, today - I do not know what happened and what I did wrong - suddenly I cannot transform my LaTex text into DVI, and the PDF file disappeared completely. 

I have the LaTex text, the DVI and the PDF stored on two USB sticks but unfortunately I did not update it every day but for the last time about four weeks ago (in the future I will be more prudent), and all my work I did in the meantime seems to be lost!!!

I had the information: This is a bad DVi file. The DVI file cannot be processed because it is not valid. 

I write a book on the history of mathematics and the Italian mathematician Rafael Bombelli (1526-1572) used his own symbol for the powers of the unknown. He used an arc, a semi-circle, above open, and there he wrote the power, 1, 2, 3 etc.

Some expert told me how to represent Bombelli's arc in LaTex: For example for 7x? I wrote 7\underarc2, and in DVI and PDF the arc with the 2 inside appeared. I used this symbol quite often. I do not know what I did in the preamble to make this command work. 

Now when I click on the icon LaTex I read in the black box:

!Undefined control sequence.
1.1427. \begin<quote|> 1\underarc3 be equal 6\underarc3... (That is, I have to arcs in line 1427.)

Am I right that if I delete all \underarcs in my text my file would be in order again? But I have so many that it is hopeless. 

Has something happened to my preamble that \underarc is not accepted any more? 

Have you any idea how I could restore my DVI and PDF?

I would be very very grateful for a solution of my problem!

First: Calm down. :-)

Before you delete anything in your source text, make a copy of it.

I've never used \underarc, but a quick search on google points to the
arcs package (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/arcs/).
Did you somehow loose the \usepackage{arcs}?

Please give the exact error message, with its line-breaks and all. Or 
attach your log file (if it's not too large)

Hi Ronald,

Thank you very much for this template. I saved is as my_book.tex. It
compiles successfully, but when I try to view output I got the following
error:



*No such file or directory: c:\UserData\latex\my_book.dvi*


Do you know I can I fix it?

Tks!

Message-ID: <87r6m7bjep.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi all.

I use plain TeX and have defined my own \chapter, \subchapter etc.  Now, my
problem is that right at the bottom of p.11 the subchapter 2 ends, and right at
the top of p.12 the subchapter 3 begins, but in the headline of p.11 there is
subchapter 3.  Here is (extremely summed up) the definition of \headline I'm
using:

  \headline={\the\subchapternumber}

Does anybody have any suggestion about this matter?
Thanks,
Rodolfo

You need to use \mark, see The TeXbook.  The problem with using
sectioning counters directly is that TeX needs to read ahead to decide
a page break, so in your case, the subchapter from the next page is
processed (and \subchapternumber is incremented) before TeX decides to
break the page before that subchapter.  To avoid this problem, marks
let you refer to the first/last mark on a boxed page.

Best,
Oleg

Subject: [texhax] framing tables
Message-ID: <20070813232505.GH13090@run.galis.org>

I'm looking for a way to frame tables, to set them off the main text.

With quite a few tables (table, not tabular) of only a line or two

\begin{table}
\begin{verbatim}
ifconfig -a
netstat -finet -nr | grep UGH | awk '{print $1}'
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Determine host address, two methods shown}
\label{tab:address}
\end{table}

and which make use of verbatim so the enclosed unix commands (ie
special latex characters) don't need escaping, the problem is the
table and caption do not stand out from the body text, making them
hard to locate.

I looked at colortbl, with the idea to set my table background to
90% gray; but that only seems to work in tabular which I'm not
using.

Hopefully I won't need the complexity of tabular. table with
verbatim is otherwise perfect.  I'm open a rectangle surrounding
my table, colored background or some other way to make them stand
out. Any suggestions?

// George

Well that works spot on! Thank you.

However I have a new problem... "Verbatim" is not recognized
by my vim syntax highlighting, which means everything past "1"
is colored as an error. Simple enough to fix with this in the
tex.vim file (not sure how to incorporate in .vimrc)

syn region texZone start="\\begin{Verbatim}" end="\\end{Verbatim}\|%stopzone\>" contains=@Spell

But I was wondering, is there a simple way to renewcommand
"Verbatim" so it is called by "verbatim" or should I stick with
fixing my editor highlighting?

Let me hasten to say that this is not something I would actually be 
interested in using since I use almost no footnotes.  But I was just 
reading a book that used sidenotes instead.  The format was roughly this:

on recto pages.  On verso the sidenotes appeared on the left.  It was 
quite attractive, if you have to use notes (I hate endnotes unless they 
are used only for citations).  The book was published by Princeton.  If 
you want to look at it, it is called "From Hand to Mouth" by Michael 
Corballis.  Naturally, I started to think how would you implement such a 
style in TeX?  I don't see any way offhand.  TeX's footnote mechanism 
shortens the page to make room for footnotes, but I see no mechanism for 
automatically narrowing the columns.  An output routine can cut pages 
short, but not reformat, as I understand it.

In my opinion it would be better to teach your editor to recognize the
Verbatim environment. I prefer not to redefine existing commands
if it's not necessary, as it's easier to tell later on which version you
were using. For me, it keeps things easier readable and maintainable.
But that's just my personal preference.

Hi Susan,
what you propose is not only your personal opinion, it is good
programming practice too.  It is always problematic to re-define
existing macros or even primitives.

Susan, I remember that you joined this mailing list because you had a
question some years ago.  I'm amazed now that you help other people
and your answers are amazingly reasonable and very precise.

It would be nice to have more people like you on this mailing list.

Best regards,
  Reinhard

Dear Reinhard,

your praise makes me blush.

Yes, I joined this list because of a question. And I kept reading because I
found I could learn a lot. And because I still use LaTeX a lot. And, of
course, because this one question was not the last, and I'm sure I will
have others again...

I still consider myself nothing more than an advanced user. That's why I
think at least twice before I answer questions here -- better be quiet and
wait for the experts to speak up than voice some bullshit.
On the other hand, I learned so much from others who invested time to
answer my questions, that I feel obliged to do the same if there's a
question I am capable of answering.

>From what I read, there are a lot of people with this world view on this

The short answer is: not really. The long answer is: perhaps, depending 
on what exactly you want to do, but coding it will probably involve a 
lot of pain. You're almost certainly better off using an external 
utility designed for this task, such as sed, awk, or perl.

However, if you really, really can't avoid doing it in TeX, here's my 
understanding of why it's so difficult (others will probably be able to 
correct/improve on this). TeX is a macro language, which means it works 
simply by expanding macros, expanding the results of that expansion, 
expanding the results of that, and so on until there's nothing left to 
expand (i.e. the expression contains only primitive or unexpandable 
tokens). When TeX reads a file, it reads the file into its input stream, 
parses the characters in the input stream, converting them into a 
sequence of tokens according to the current category codes ("catcodes"), 
then expands these tokens as necessary. There's a better description of 
this whole process in the "TeX-by-Topic" book (available online).

To get TeX to replace one string (that matches a regexp, say) with 
another, you would have to make that string expandable in some way. This 
would probably involve changing the catcodes of those characters, since 
normal letters are otherwise parsed as single, unexpandable tokens. 
However, the catcodes take effect when the input stream is parsed, so 
you'd have to change the catcodes before the string you intend to 
replace gets parsed. If you wanted to do general string replacement on 
an input file, you'd essentially have to turn TeX into a 
string-replacement machine by redefining catcodes and defining the 
necessary macros right at the start, before the file gets read into the 
input stream. This might be possible in principle, but it will 
undoubtedly be difficult. Then you'll need to undo all this messing 
around with TeX internals, and feed everything back into TeX to have it 
process the string-replaced file normally. However, the catcodes were 
already fixed when the file was read the first time. The only way to 
fully "reset" the catcodes is to write the string-replaced file to disk, 
revert the catcodes, then re-read the file again.

I expect you'd rather not have to code all this :)

If you want to see an example of this kind of thing in action, you could 
have a look at the code that implements the "poorman" option in my 
"cleveref" package (on CTAN). I used a very simplified form of the above 
to do very, very simple string replacement: replacing certain single 
characters in a file with "escaped" versions of those characters. As 
you'll see if you look at the code, it works by changing the catcodes of 
the relevant characters to turn them into active characters (single 
characters that TeX expands into something else), reading the file into 
the TeX input stream and processing it, thereby replacing the active 
characters with their expansions, and writing the result back out to file.

Hope that helps. I'm still a relative novice at TeX programming, so some 
of what I said might be inaccurate, but TeXperts on this list should be 
able to correct it.

Tony's answer was excellent, but there has been a recent new  
development and there are some alternatives which he didn't mention:

  - luatex, the successor to pdftex builds in the lua scripting  
language, so makes this sort of thing a feature, http:// 
www.luatex.org/ --- they've begun making betas available, so you  
could try it now.

  - alternately, one could, using multiple passes, write out a file,  
use shell escape to process it, then read back in the processed  
version, or

  - use a makefile to manage your TeX compilation and set the  
processing to happen using that (call tex to force the extraction,  
then call your scripts on the extracted bits, then call tex which is  
then able to read in the processed bits)

Hi!
 
I need to put an extra text line at the beginning of the List of Figures page.
I've tried

\addtocontents{lof}{text}

but it only works if I give this command right close to \end{document}.
And the text line appears at the *end* of the List of Figures...
If I try to give the very same command in a place before putting the figures I 
get an error:

! LaTeX Error: Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

l.77 \addvspace {10\p@ }

?                         

I've edited the .lof file when I get the error and apparently the text line is 
placed ok and I don't see anything wrong.  What am I overlooking?
Can someone give me a hint, please?
Thank you very much,
Nat?rcia

PS - I'm using scrbook as documentclass.

... or probably Lua?

LuaTeX is certainly a better solution, especially if portability is
important.  I suppose that LuaTeX is even much faster than forking
external programs.

   http://www.luatex.org/documentation.html

Lua is a relatively simple but very powerful programming language.

   http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1

LuaTeX will be shipped with TeXLive-2008 and as far as I know it is
already part of W32-TeX.  LuaTeX is supposed to be the successor of
pdfTeX in the near future.

I strongly recommend to read the LuaTeX documentation before trying
anything else.

Regards,
  Reinhard

I must correct myself, the begdef and enddef parameters tolerate opening
and closing braces. The following code seems to work as expected:

\newenvironment{storetoks}{\global\mytoks{}{}}

Dear list,

I'd like to create a LaTeX environment, using \newenvironment{}{}{},
that stores the commands between \begin and \end into a token register.

The following code fails with the message `! Missing { inserted.' :

--- 8< ---
\documentclass{article}

\newtoks\mytoks
\newenvironment{storetoks}{\global\mytoks}{}

\begin{document}

\begin{storetoks}%
  Hello!%
\end{storetoks}

\the\mytoks %exec token register

\end{document}
--- >8 ---

Unfortunately, I cannot put unbalanced {'s and }'s into the begdef and
enddef parameters of \newenvironment. Perhaps you have got an idea what
to do? There must be a way to accomplish this, since LaTeX defines,
e.g., the `lrbox' environment from the TeX command \setbox which seems
to be a similar task.

Help is greatly appreciated!

Yours,
Alexander

This executes
  \global\mytoks{}{}
at the beginning of the environment. What happes afterwards depends on  
what follows in your definition, if its a blank line it merely inserts a  
\par token.

\setbox works differently as it keeps typesetting while looking for a  
token with meaning }, this is why \egroup is used and it works. toks  
registers on the other hand need balanced text from the input and so can't  
use a } buried in some macro definition.

Look for amsmath's way of grabbing the contents of an environment:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\newtoks\mytoks
\newenvironment{storetoks}{\global\mytoks{}{}}{after}

\makeatletter
\newenvironment{testing}{\collect at body\testfunc}{}
\newcommand\testfunc[1]{Here is the contents: ``#1''}
\makeatother
\begin{document}

\begin{storetoks}%
   Hello!%
\end{storetoks}

``\the\mytoks'' %oops, it's empty.

\begin{testing}
   Hello World.
\end{testing}
\end{document}

Thanks, Morten. Do you think that this definition of my `storetoks'
environment based on \collect at body is correct?

-- 8< --
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\newtoks\mytoks

\makeatletter
\newenvironment{storetoks}{\collect at body\myfunc}{}
\def\myfunc#1{\global\mytoks={#1}}

\begin{document}

\begin{storetoks}%
  Hello!%
\end{storetoks}

``\the\mytoks''

\end{document}

I tried to figure out what they are doing in the \collect at body definition
in amsmat.sty but, I didn't get the essence. Is there a short and easy
way to re-implement this macro in order to be independent of amsmath.sty?

Looks okay to me.

Not really except for copying the definitions from amsmath.sty. One slight  
change you could introduce for your version (with different name I expect)  
is to make \collect at body \long.

Hello Folks,

I really apologize to contact you directly
but I realy went over everything I found on the web about my issue...

The aim:
Depending on the options passed to my class, I'd like
a various packages to be used or not used - checkout what I tried...

\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
\ProvidesClass{sciencearticle}[2007/08/15 The Science Article Class]

\DeclareOption{chem}
  {
    \typeout{Providing packages for the Chemistry}
    \RequirePackage[version=3]{mhchem}
  }
\DeclareOption{chemext}
  {
    \typeout{Providing packages for the Chemistry - Extended}
    \RequirePackage[version=3]{mhchem}
    \RequirePackage{epic}
    \RequirePackage{chemstr}
    \RequirePackage{carom}
    \RequirePackage{hetarom}
    \RequirePackage{hetaromh}
    \RequirePackage{lowcycle}
    \RequirePackage{ccycle}
    \RequirePackage{hcycle}
    \RequirePackage{aliphat}
    \RequirePackage{locant}
    \RequirePackage{polymers}
    \RequirePackage{methylen}
    \RequirePackage{fusering}
    \RequirePackage{sizeredc}
  }

\ProcessOptions\relax
\LoadClass[a4paper, twoside, 11pt]{article}

This is not working and the message is:
! LaTeX Error: \RequirePackage or \LoadClass in Options Section.

Could somebody please help me on how to bind the packages
optionally.

Many thanks in advance

Zoran Nikolic

I'm a TUG neophyte. But I tex everything. Started in 1996 with plaintex
on DOS 5.11 (?Maybe, not sure) Thought I was savvy. But my DOS 5.11 (or

Texlive2007 looks latex. Winshell is latex. I load Texlive2007 over and

plaintex editor. I'LL PAY. I would like a plaintex environment. I know
latex may be tex-du-jour but I'm conversant with plaintex, and I'm too
OLD to learn latex. You may not appreciate that such a Neanderthal
exists. Can't be impossible to start the simple way with plaintex! And
which editor?  Please, start with words of one syllable.

ProTeXt (based on MikTeX: http://www.miktex.org/ ) and TeXLive are  
complete TeX & friends (plain TeX, LaTeX, etc.) distributions.


> Winshell is latex.

It's indeed, as far as I know, a LaTeX front-end editor. I don't know  
if it can send plain TeX commands.

You have to achieve a successful installation first, in order to be  
able to use plain TeX. Maybe if you give more data someone here can  
help you with this.


> But then I still need a plaintex editor. I?LL PAY.

You don't have to pay. You already have Emacs with AUCTeX for Windows  
in your DVD.


> I would like a plaintex environment.

You will have it as soon as you have your installation running OK. I  
use TeX and LaTeX with TeXLive (on a Mac, but both are the same) and  
it works fine.

Axel

I would like to know how to do, to send a contribution to TUG.
This one is a type1 fonts collection made by ADF to TUG.
- As derivative works from Utopia and promote TEX use, Venturis

- Fonts aren't available to download from the ADF home page
just PDF to preview at this moment.
- Perhaps possible to select only fonts wanted.

Subject: [texhax] Extra space above multline (Bug in amsmath?)
Message-ID: <20070817141416.GA9189@alpha>

Hi,

I have noticed that the space above multline from amsmath.sty is
always bigger then the other environments. Carefully looking at the
examples in testmath.pdf or TLC2 also shows this difference. The space
above is gettig bigger if the text has to stretch vertically. There is
also even a bigger difference between equation and the other amsmath
environments! So, the different spacing, using equation and multline
on the same page, can be visually recognised. 

The \jot has to do with this extra space of multline. If I set \jot to
0 in the following example, the extra space of multline vanish. Is
this a bug? I can't imagine, that I am the first who finds this
difference. I've searched the newsgroups and the bug database but
didn't find something. Here is the example example.

This was reported in December last year here on texhax. Checking my mail  
archive I am not sure I ever posted the fix here but AMS is informed. The  
diagnosis is as follows:

If we compare it to the gather environment we notice the following:
\gather@ also applies \jot to \lineskip and friends but in the measuring
phase, \gmeasure@ locally resets \everycr. \multline@ also applies \jot
but \mmeasure@ does not reset \everycr so the extra \jot we see is
inserted in the measuring phase. Adding a
   \everycr={}%
right after
   \setbox\@ne\vbox{%
in \mmeasure@ seems to take care of the problem. Attached is a small
testfile.

Subject: [texhax] Latex in spanish and using the spell check
Message-ID: <37C71953-8F20-4921-90EB-828583AC2070@gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to write latex files in spanish.

Previously to get ? I used \'o.

Then I installed babel and it seems that instead I can get ? with ?o.

So to write poblaci?n I have to write poblaci'on (with babel) or  
poblaci\'on. (without babel)

However when I use spell check in the tex file, both poblaci'on and  
poblaci\'on will be highlighted as incorrectly spelt words (even  
though they are correct in the .pdf file)

It would be great if I could use the standard spanish keyboard to  
type letters such as ? in the tex file to faciliate spell checking.
Is this possible???

Thanks,
Marie

You can use spanish (or portuguese or german or ...) characters directly.

Try this:

    \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

Most of the ISO 8859 latin alphabets are supported.

I would follow this advice (though I would use utf8, instead of  
latin1), which has the advantage that you can type poblaci?n, poblaci 
\'on or poblaci\'{o}n and you'll get the same output.

To be able to type poblaci\'on and J.~N (without getting J.?) use

\usepackage[spanish]{babel}
\let\layoutspanish\relax


Best,

Axel

Sorry \let\layoutspanish\relax is wrong (for this case). The right  
command is

\renewcommand\shorthandsspanish{}

But what version are you using? Because if I type poblaci'on I get  
poblaci?on.

Yes, the fix works. May be you should include it in your excellent
mathtools package.

Subject: [texhax] \Pr and displaylimits
Message-ID: <alpine.WNT.0.999.0708182305390.3836@nqvgln>

Hi,

I have a question about the rationale of defining \Pr with 
displaylimits.

In plain.tex \Pr is defined without \nolimits as

\def\Pr{\mathop{\rm Pr}}

Other macro packages (LaTeX and ConTeXt) provide hooks for changing 
operator fonts, but basically copy this definition without the 
nolimits. In the books that I have seen, limits on Pr have the visual 
effect of

\Pr\nolimits^{g}(X \mid Y)

So why did Knuth choose not to have a \nolimit with \Pr. 
Are there branches of mathematics where limits with Pr should be 
displaylimits?

The winfonts package provides metrics for the TrueType Georgia

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0708211029320.27082-100000@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

I am involved in a project to reprint a 40 year old volume of Lecture 
Notes in Math.  One of the authors used an arc over a letter for 
something.  Although the character appears at position "7F in the mit 
font, I could not find a macro that implemented it.  I tried defining 
\def\arc{\mathaccent"717F }
It sort of worked.  Note that it leads to some incomprehensible error 
message without that space at the end.  However, the arc was almost 
hanging off the right edge of the character (I tested it with $\arc A$).  
It wasn't perfect, but I figured that it would do.  Then I found a double 
arc over some character.  Trying $\arc\arc A$ gave an error and $\arc{\arc 
A}$ put the second arc centered over the whole, that is offset to the left 
from the first and really looked awful.  Finally, I 
tried
\def\Arc{\mathaccent"717F }
\def\arc#1{\Arc{\hbox{$#1$}}}
This works.  $\arc A$ now centers the arc over the A and $\arc{\arc A}$ 
now puts the two arcs one above the other.  So my problem is solved, but 
can anyone explain what is going on here, why the simple macro didn't 
work?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0708212159500.27082-100000@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

Here is a problem that has me stymied.  Consider the file:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{test}

\begin{document}
\cite{slo}
\begin{thebibliography}{}
\bibitem [S\pol omi\'nski (1959)]{slo} J. S\pol omi\'nski (1959), {\bf
The theory of abstract algebras with infinitary operations}.  Rozprawy
Mat. {\bf18}, Warszawa.
\end{thebibliography}
\end{document}

The contents of test.sty are:

\let\pol\l
 % \renewcommand{\l}{\mathop{\ell}}

Everything works well.  Now take out the comment mark and it blows up.
Using \def instead of \renewcommand makes no difference.  It is only in
the \cite macro that the problem arises; take that out and the reference
is set correctly.  I believed that \let sets it argument in stone; that
no further redefinition of \l would have any effect on \pol, but this is
apparently not the case.  Any help would be appreciated.  I can and will
fill in the citation by hand, if necessary, but I would like to know
what is going on.

\l is defined with \DeclareTextCommand which leads to the following  
firstlevel expansion:
   \l ->\OT1-cmd \l \OT1\l

The \l contained therein is used when writing to files to ensure  
robustness, so when you do \let\pol\l it still writes \l to the aux file,  
where references are stored.

You need to use the interface provided by LaTeX for this and use the  
definition from ot1enc.def only exchanging \pol for \l:
   \DeclareTextCommand{\pol}{OT1}{\hmode at bgroup\@xxxii l\egroup}

This sounds really interesting!

Does anyone knows how to do it?

The moral being that LaTeX programming is no longer a superset of
basic TeX programming.  It's called progress!

I agree too, maybe my ego was reacting to frustration. But the
main impetus was 'there should be an easy way users'; as it turns
out, there is a way for users to modify their syntax highlighting,
but it's much simpler to add a line to the existing editor syntax
rule, as root. Now, I'm using the old verbatim too, so the editor
fix does seem best.

it creates something like this:

As I'm writing a document in Portuguese, I want to appear "Capitulo" instead

Message-ID: <794c44a30708280422w1eff2ef9xb9da3c6a738a6ac0@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I want to set the same footer in all main pages of a book. I use the
following code.

\pagestyle{fancy}
\renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{\markright{\chaptername\ \thechapter.\ #1}}
\renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markright{\thesection.\ #1}{}}
\lhead[\fancyplain{}{}]%
      {\fancyplain{}{\bfseries\rightmark}}
\chead[\fancyplain{}{}]%
      {\fancyplain{}{}}
\rhead[\fancyplain{}{}]%
      {\fancyplain{}{\bfseries\thepage}}
\lfoot[\fancyplain{}{}]%
      {\fancyplain{}{}}
\cfoot[\fancyplain{}{}]%
      {\fancyplain{}{}}
\rfoot[\fancyplain{}{}]%
      {\fancyplain{}{ \includegraphics{footer.eps}}}


The problem is, for instance, the image footer.eps only appears in 2 pages
of a 19 page document. Why? How can I do it to appear in all pages?

Tks!

Does putting \setcounter{page}{35} just after your \begin{document}
help?

Well, what you need is not to start the preview on page 35, but to have the first page numbered 35. To do that, add

\setcounter{page}{35}

in the beginning of the document (just after \begin{document}, for exemplo.

Subject: [texhax] special characters in \includegraphics arg?
Message-ID: <200708282359.l7SNx3d10951@f7.net>

Suppose I want to use \includegraphics to insert a file whose name
contains \ or # (among other, obviously) characters, for instance:
  \includegraphics{c:\somefile#.jpg}

All I've been able to imagine is writing a wrapper for \includegraphics
that resets the catcodes and calls the real \includegraphics.  Maybe
making use of the new filename quoting stuff in recent Web2C's, I'm not
sure.

My question is, has this already been done?  Is there some option or
package that makes it easier to use special characters in filenames?
I poked around in the FAQ and on the net, etc., to no particular avail.

I was asked specifically about \includegraphics, although obviously the
same question can arise with any macro that takes a filename argument.

Thanks,
k

Try to avoid this. When I had to write an application that had to
include arbitrary files via \includegraphics, I had the application
create symlinks from these files to files with names TeX can handle
easily, and then let TeX include these files.

Dear Sir or Madam,

I experienced some trouble while getting the latex style file 
"pst-3dplot.sty". I neither found the latest release (as of 2007-08-18) 
on any ctan mirror page nor on ctan itself. Instead, I noticed on 
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/cdbuild/logs/svnlog?view=markup&sortby=date&pathrev=4779 
that the file I am searching for was deleted (D) more than week ago:

I don't think that might work. As far as I know SW does not include 
dvips!, which is needed to run pstricks (as far as I know)

Message-ID: <4896FEF35D359441AB2A680756941DDD0148B464@MAIL2.mcs.usyd.edu.au>

G'day,

 

I have a problem with preparing slide presentations with Winedt/MikTeX.
I have asked the Winedt people, they referred me to TUG.

 

I'm trying to prepare a slide presentation (for Friday morning) using

WinEdt and latex (lots of maths). I want to produce them in pdf form,

but am having a nightmare trying to get them to work (in landscape).
There are two

alternatives, but neither is working ...

 

 

1. If I use the dvi2pdf converter in the winedt toolbar, I cant get

the pdf output to come out in landscape mode, despite having used the

following in latex

 

 

\documentclass[landscape]{seminar}            (by the way, the 'slides'

class doesn't do it either). I have also tried the following

 

\usepackage[landscape]{geometry}               but that doesn't help

either.

 

 

Is this a problem with adobe distiller setup? I've tried setting

landscape defaults in there too but that doesn't work. Can you advise

how to fix this?

 

 

2. If I use the dvips and then the ps2pdf tools in the toolbar,

this produces a landscape pdf output, but none of the .eps figures

appear. These are included in the latex with

 

\usepackage{epsfig}       I've also tried     \usepackage{pstricks}   to

no avail.

 

 

Are you able to advise on how to get either of these methods (preferably

both) to work?

 

 

Any help is very much appreciated. Thanks,

 

 

Peter

try

\usepackage[landscape,dvips]{geometry}

and then use dvips->ps2pdf

btw: seminar is really out of date, try powerdot instead

Besides the already suggested pstricks, there is Tikz, part of the pgf
package. I find it very nice, and it comes with a very good manual.

There are (at least) two main packages worth considering:

pgf/TikZ and pstricks

Hello,

Anyone here who knows how to install pgf?

I get the following message when I run pdflatex on a simple tex file that
contains the line \usepackage{tikz}.

....
(/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/xkeyval/xkeyval.tex))
(/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/pgf-1.01/generic/pgf/frontendlayer/tikz.code.tex
! Undefined control sequence.
l.658 \pgfsetsnakesegmenttransformation
                                       {\pgf at snake@mirror\pgf at snake@raise}
?


Is the tikz.code.tex file in my package corrupted?
I downloaded the pgf-1.01 this evening from source forge I believe.

Any help would be appreciated.
If you need more info please go ahead and ask, I simply did not know what
to provide and I try to keep this post short.

many thanks in advance

anne

Well, this version (1.01) is somewhat old. I'd recommend getting the
latest version (1.18). Could be the cause of the problem. And even if
not, many things have changed and there are some nice new features.

I think that beamer is the most advanced package available today and I
can't recommend people to use anything else.

Maybe you have the first edition of the LaTeX Companion which had been
relaesed a few days before the graphics package had been made available.

The graphics package provides a much better user interface, see

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf

Using epsfig cannot be recommended anymore (though it still works).

  Reinhard

using powerdot makes much more sense when I do not
need all the hundreds of options, which beamer provides ...
and which confuses the user sometimes.

    that the file I am searching for was deleted (D) more than week ago:

Glad you mentioned it.  I've restored to TL now.  It's not entirely
clear to me why it got removed.

Anyway, as Herbert said, the pstricks web site (or CTAN) is the
canonical source for these things.

Thanks,
Karl

The only think that I can think of, if you are using the tikz frontend
and not pgf directly, is to use \usetikzlibrary{plothandlers} instead of
\usepgflibrary.

Subject: [texhax] Extra space around
Message-ID: <200708310922.29003.tug@wiseguysweb.com>

I have used the following code snippit to display an image on a document.  
However, the image has more space around the righthand side than the rest of 
the frame.  I need to use the pstricks package to get the effects I want as 
well.

I have tried the following image formats: jpeg, eps, pdf.  If I view the 
original image, there is no padding on the righthand side.

Why is the extra space there?
How do I get rid of the extra space on the righthand side?

Thanks,
Bart

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{pstricks}

\begin{document}

\psframebox[framearc=0, framesep=2pt]{%
  \includegraphics[bb=0 0 1600 1200, width=\textwidth]{images/sunset.eps}
}

\end{document}

  \includegraphics[bb=0 0 1600 1200, width=\textwidth]{images/sunset.eps}%
}

without the % you'll get a space
