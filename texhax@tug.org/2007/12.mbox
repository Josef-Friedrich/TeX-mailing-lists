Hello all,
Generally, to do citation I use \cite{r1,r2,r3}  which gives for example: [1,2,3,4].
What can I do with the \cite command such that I get [1-4].
Regards
Sarah

Little hidden secret: the TeX primitive \font works even in LaTeX, so you can 
set e.g.,
\font\rm bchr8r at 13.5 pt
or whatever you like.  You can also decrease margins for just one page with 
TeX primitives by fiddling with \hsize and \hoffset.  There may be side 
effects however.

You can set and then reset the \hyphenpenalty I suppose.  Generally a penalty 
of 10000 is an absolute barrier to an action.  The default hyphenpenalty is 
50 in plain TeX.

Subject: [texhax] Drawing graphs with TikZ
Message-ID: <47528158.2070902@psych.uib.no>

Recently I have been trying to make figures of directed graphs (nodes 
and arrows between them) , and all my efforts have failed.  I simply 
do not understand what is going on.  As a final attempt, I have tried 
to reproduce the figure on page 36 of the Tikz and pgf manual (version 
1.18), where the latex file has been reduced to the bare essentials 
like this:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \path ( 0:2) node [shape=circle,draw] {}
          ( 0:1) node [shape=circle,draw] {}
          ( 0:0) node [shape=circle,draw] {}
          ( 1,1) node [shape=rectangle,draw] {}
          (-1,1) node [shape=rectangle,draw] {};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

This results in a figure nothing like the one in the manual, where the 
circles are all along a horizontal line (rather than vertical) with 
the squares above and somewhat to the left of the sequence of the 
circles.  As far As I am able to see, this is an exact reproduction of 
the example.

Can anyone point at my error?

Tom

It is really strange.  So often, when you do any kind of programming 
you see your error, but not before the question is out.  In this case 
it is the colons in the circle that yields the unexpected results 
without any kind of message.

Sorry.

Dear Tom,

TikZ has a very flexible syntax for specifying coordinates; your code  
didn't cause an error because it's not erroneous!  The coordinate  
specification (x,y) is for Cartesian coordinates, and (theta:r) is  
for polar coordinates.  So your coordinate (0:2) is 2 cm along the  
polar line theta=0, i.e, the point with cartesian coordinates (2,0).

There is a very friendly mailing list just for pgf and tikz users:

	https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pgf-users

Take care and good luck.

Subject: [texhax] Running LaTex off a stick.
Message-ID: <4753C9A7.8080402@psych.uib.no>

By accident I came across this site the other day: 
http://portableapps.com/.  Which started me thinking about saving 
weight, if I could have everything I normally need on a stick, I would 
not have to carry a computer around.  These sticks are getting cheaper 
very day and increasing in capacity all the time (the price of an 8GB 
one is about 125 Euros now)

So, is it possible to run something like MikTex off a stick for one 
thing?  And are there any suitable editors around (for the most part I 
use WinEdt) ?

Have a look into:

However, an editor is _not_ included. One that claims to be portable is

Subject: [texhax] Adjusting width of quote and quotation environments
Message-ID: <569981.76413.qm@web53204.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

G'day from Downunder! (Hello from Australia!)

I am preparing my third non-fiction book (and only my first attempt with LaTeX typesetting!), with LaTeX's memoir class , but, after looking through the Memoir manual, Memoir addendum, The Guide to LaTeX (Fourth Edition), The LaTeX Companion (Second Edition), The TeXbook, and the UK FAQ I have not been able to find out how to adjust the width of the quote and quotation environments. 

As my book is a compilation of 1,100 quotations, I actually want the quotes to fill the whole width of the page and not be indented on both sides from the margins...

Is this something to do with \adjustwidth?

Also, how do I put an author's name flushright and birth and death dates afterwards, without running over two lines and leaving a blank line?

Doing this...

\begin{quote}
This is a treasury of inspiration, stimulation and fun for writers.\begin{flushright}\textit {Dan Poynter,} author of\\* \textsc {The Self-Publishing Manual}\end{flushright}
\end{quote}

leaves a big blank space between the quote and author that I can't get rid of.

Doing this...

\begin{quote}
How many people eat, drink, and get married; buy, sell, and build; make contracts and attend to their fortune; have friends and enemies, pleasures and pains, are born, grow up, live and die---but asleep!

\hfill\textit{Joseph Joubert (1754--1824)}
\end{quote}

works, except when the author's name goes over the line, because then the next (carryover) line is left justified.

I would really appreciate if you could point me in the right direction.
Thank you very much for your time.
Cheers,

Subject: [texhax] accents in figure caption
Message-ID: <47543372.1030002@ametsoc.org>

Is there some trick to getting accents/special characters to work in 
figure captions?  I want to place an umlaut above an "a" (for the name 
V\"ais\"al\"a).  Using: \"a works fine in the main body, but when I try 
this (or any other accent mark) in a figure caption I get errors. I also 
tried \protect\"a, but that did not help. I assume I am missing 
something obvious.
I am using protext and the article class.

Thanks,
Brian

If you don't understand the error message, please post it to the list.
It's also helpful if you could provide a *minimal* tex file which
shows this error.  But the statement "I get errors" is not very
helpful at all.

Regrads,

i suppose i should respond on-list - i was interested in something more 
elaborate than that that i didnt want to write all out, but here goes :

up above i _specifically_ wrote "troubleshooting", and i specified "in any 
setting" (with underlines).  i've googled for $\geq$ 30 minutes and ran 
latex $\geq$30 times trying to make viz. floatflt work and discovered that 
the starting points in the FAQ, though helpful in what they do, do not pan 
out when faced with e.g. teasing apart why floatflt works perfectly 
sometimes and fails at others.  there is a handy troubleshooting page out 
there for enumerate and floatflt conflicts along the lines of what i'd 
like for making floatflt work exactly how i'd like - i thought that 
something like a compilation of specific problems with floatflt and how to 
work around them - perhaps in gory detail - detail is good.

the link to the FAQ is of course interesting - it comes up everytime i 
google this, and i read it every time.  in fact, this is how i discovered 
that floatflt seems a little bit better than others - ok, i'll read it 
again - ah, this is the go-to list from Piet van Oostrum, (thank you!), 
and latex isn't really designed for these problems, i can understand - 
"they all have their limitations" - so where in that entry it _details_ 
the reasons where e.g. floatflt works or fails in e.g. two-column 
environment, why tables look perfect then disappear when moved. ... did i 
miss something? ... it _can_ work perfectly - why?  *what ARE the specific 
limitations, in detail?*

and just to check myself here : "Volume is not precision" "be explicit 
about your question" ... well, i think my previous question with 
specifications avoided this huge one ... "vagueness about the actual 
problem ... is not helpful".  you know, reading that FAQ helped me specify 
a question - thanks!  ahh, good 'ol esr, always worth another read.

This is an area I have hit on numerous occasions, with usually partial
success. IMHO it's one for which a fresh look by someone with adequate
time and expertise would be welcome (this rules me out on both counts).
As a start to Bryan's attempt to compile/extend the FAQ on this matter,
I append the text of an old posting of mine. You will also find much of
this in the texhax archives. In particular, I have tried extensively to
locate the author of picins without success. There is a helpful summary
written by Piet van Oostrum, but the package really needs an overhaul.

    Subject: picins bug
    Date: Sat, 18 Feb 2006 17:07:08 +0000

I am using the picins package to flow text around a figure. It has the
advantage over others (wrapfig and floatflt) that it works within list
environments. However, the attached example shows that it does not
properly restore the list indentation if used in only one of the list
items. The one following the picins is ok, but the 2nd and subsequent
after that is incorrect. In two-column mode, even the 2nd item doesn't 
get indented properly.
    
I have a workaroud, which is to put a blank \parpic at the end of each
following item. That adds a bit of vertical space but is otherwise ok.
Another workaround would be welcome.
    
It would seem that the author of this package is not traceable, and the
code too dense for me to figure out what is going wrong. Has someone
else hit/solved this? It's an old (latex209?) package; version 3.0.
    
    Cheers,
    Steve

The ???? is the *encoding*, which is similar for simple ascii characters but differs 
for accented characters.  cmr12 lacks these characters entirely.  Try more
thorough font sample text.

Thanks very much; ec-lmr12 turns out to be the version that's
compatible with the rarer characters in the source file I'm trying to
print.

Sorry for my impatience but does anyone have any kind of pointers for
this? I know about and read the apacite.pdf and still don't understand
what I am doing wrong.

Also, when I use commands such as \fullcite or \citeNP, latex gives me a
"extra engroup" error for that entry. When I use \cite, latex gives
"Author(year)" instead of "(Author, year)".

Google doesn't give anything, probably because I have the wrong
keywords... One site suggested that I use texhash - I double-checked my
ls-R and apacite is in there. logs show that it is being used during
compilation.

Any pointers appreciated,
Thanks,
Mehmet.

Shouldn't you use \citep* rather than \fullcite? (apacite.pdf, p. 38,  
Table 2.)

My understanding is that cite(al)p is for natbib, (full)cite(NP) is for
apacite: "apacite, building on its predecessors, uses \cite for
parenthetical citations and \citeA for intext citations, whereas natbib
uses \citep  and \citet for these purposes." (p. 39, 4th paragraph)

But in my case, \cite doesn't work as intended and deviations like
fullcite and citeNP don't work at all...

Mehmet.

Hi sarah,

Thanks for the response. I read the file previously. I also searched the
file for explanations of errors but I couldn't find anything relevant
(except loading apacite before natbib, which does't work). Did you have
something specific in your mind?

Also, if this is relevant, when the cite{} command works, it cites as
"Authore (year)" instead of "(Author, year)". Also the common error I
get is in the lines of:
"./file.tex:50:Extra \endgroup. bla\citeNP{burawoy1990}"

I guess I will use something else to type this up?
Thanks anyway,
Mehmet.

Dear TeXies:

I am trying my hands on your xmltex project and it works fine, but I am facing problem with hyperref package. I was trying to retain cross-links in pdf file but somehow it is not responding as I want. Mention below is the codes:

XML File:

<cite rid=?cr1?>Author Name, 2007</cite>

Bibliography:

<citation id="cr1">Applied Science Associates (ASA). 2001. Project Report for Greenwich Bay Water Quality Summer 2000. ASA Project No. 00-029 for RIDEM. </citation>

XMT File:

\XMLelement{cite}
{\XMLattribute{rid}{\RID}{}}
{\xmlgrab}
{\xdef\ctid{\RID}\hyperlink{\ctid}{#1}}


\XMLelement{Citation}
{\XMLattribute{id}{\BIBID}{}}
{\xmlgrab}
{\xdef\bid{\BIBID}\gdef\temp{\hypertarget{\bid}{}\bibitem{}#1}\aftergroup\temp}


Everything is fine except cross-link in pdf. Kindly suggest how to eradicate such type of issues.

Regards,
...Jay

Did you notice that you are using non-ASCII double-quotes in the XML
file?  Maybe the XML parser doesn't recognize them.

I received the above based on the author seeing my name in the SAS-L

Does anyone have any knowledge of or experience with this company?

Their website is probably a .sig from the mid 90s:

    pdfTeX warning: pdftex (file texnansi-raw-ugmr8a): Font texnansi-raw-ugmr8a at
    600 not found

This is saying that there is no entry for texnansi-raw-ugmr8a in
pdftex.map.  So it's looking for a bitmap font instead, and failing.

Usually that map entry is created by updmap, which is generally done at
installation.  (No clue what gutsy does specifically; this is an area
where distributions differ.)

But Garamond in particular has another potential problem -- 
do you have the actual ugmr8a.pfb (and related) .pfb's installed?
They are under the AFPL, hence nonfree, hence (I presume) not part of
gutsy.  Without that, naturally pdftex isn't going to have any luck.

Perhaps the easiest way to install Garamond, and other such "semifree"
fonts is to use the getnonfreefonts script written by Reinhard Kotucha. 
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/getnonfreefonts/
(You might also already have it on your system.)

But there is another potential issue: I don't see any tfm file named
"texnansi-raw-ugmr8a.tfm" in any of the usual places.  It seems
surprising to me that gutsy created such a thing, but I guess it's
possible.

In summary: you might look at your pdftex.map and see if there are
entries for any "ugm" fonts.  And make sure you have the pfb's.

Good luck,
karl

OK. I'll confess that despite many (many!) attempts over the years to
understand how fonts work in TeX, I really don't understand how the
bzillion files (all of which seem have to have exactly the right contents)
are inter-related. [I can happily write plain TeX macros and produce entire
books in plain TeX -- but the scaffolding that's used for fonts leaves me
completely mystified.]

FWIW, I have not changed any of the files from what the gutsy packages have
installed.

So I grepped the pdftex.map file:

I found it interesting (and of course I don't understand this) that the tfm
file is called texnansi-ugmr8a.tfm, and yet the error message refers to
texnansi-raw-ugmr8a. Presumably that makes some sort of sense to those who
understand this stuff :-)

Anyway, as you can see from the above grep, there's certainly no mention of
texnansi-raw-ugmr8a in the pdftex.map.

So from what you said, this sounds like a bug in the distribution. If you
can confirm that indeed there should be some entry for texnansi-raw-ugmr8a,
I will file a bug report.

That script was on the system, and I have now run it. This means that there
is now a ugmr8a.pfb (under my $HOME/texmf, not under /usr/share/texmf where
all the fonts originally installed by gutsy are located). But I still get
exactly the same error when I run the pdftex command..

It looks to me like the files are fairly hopelessly inconsistent and I
should file this as a bug report against gutsy. No doubt an expert could
unravel and fix it all, but it seems to me that the ubuntu people need to
fix the inconsistencies, otherwise others are going to run into the same
problems as I am seeing.

Does filing a bug report against gutsy sound like a reasonable thing to do?
I mean, it sure looks to me like gutsy has installed a tfm file for a font
that isn't actually usable.

There is also a script getnonfreefonts-sys (actually just a sym link to 
getnonfreefonts, but the name makes a difference), you can run it as root 
by

   su getnonfreefonts-sys

and this will install the fonts in the correct (/usr/share/texmf 
directory. For me

locate ugmr8r

gives

/usr/local/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/urw/garamond/ugmr8r.tfm

I don't know how to get the font mappings right, but hopefully having a 
system wide install may be helpful for future.

Message-ID: <ab0c618e0712110038m44335d6n9c8716f90e95d73b@mail.gmail.com>

I'm writing a CV/resume and would like to have a BibTeX generated
bibliography.

The problem is that bibtex wants to insert "References" in large letters at
the top of the bibliography.

I want this to instead say "Publications" since "References" has a different
connotation in the context of a resume.

I've been googling for a half hour and can't find out how to do this.

Thanks for any help,

no, that is not bibtex, that,s the generated 'thebibliography' 
environment, so redefine \refname or \bibname depending on which class you

Hi,

I am trying to finish 'typing' this paper in latex, and I got stuck in
a not-so-important issue. I was hoping you could give me some quick
pointers to guide me?

The document class I am using is 'article'. The issue is, even if I
put \maketitle within a firstpage environment, or even if I specify
\thispagestyle{empty} right before the \maketitle, the first page
still is printed with a page number. Google didn't quite help so far
especially because the above are the ones it suggests.

Do you have any quick pointers?

Also, did anyone here use UMCP's thesis latex template[1] to write
their dissertation / thesis *with* apacite as the bibliography style?
It seems that hyperref conflicts with apacite and the template becomes
unusable without hyperref. If you take out hyperref, latex gives you
'no counter defined for item' errors. Does anyone have any ideas or
experience on how to solve this?

Thanks a lot,
Mehmet Ergun.

Put the \thispagestyle{empty} *after* \maketitle (\maketitle resets the page style).

It's better to use the current version:

  ftp://tug.org/tex/getnonfreefonts/getnonfreefonts

I'll update the stuff on CTAN after I updated the stuff itself.

    the scaffolding that's used for fonts 

It's not really *that* complicated.

When you say 
\font\foo = bar
TeX looks for bar.tfm.  That's all TeX-the-typesetter cares about, the
metrics.

Now, when pdftex is used, of course it has to find the actual glyphs.
So it looks in the file pdftex.map.  If the name of the tfm file appears
in the first column of pdftex.map, then it follows the instructions on
the rest of the line (typically to download a pfb using some encoding.)

If the tfm name doesn't appear in pdftex.map, it falls back to trying to
make a bitmap font.

When dvips is used, it's the same procedure, except psfonts.map is used
for lookup instead of pdftex.map.

pdftex.map and psfonts.map (and dvipdfm's map file too) are typically
maintained via running updmap[-sys].

    \font\rm=texnansi-ugmr8a
    ...
    I found it interesting (and of course I don't understand this) that the tfm
    file is called texnansi-ugmr8a.tfm, and yet the error message refers to
    texnansi-raw-ugmr8a. Presumably that makes some sort of sense to those who
    understand this stuff :-)

Actually, this does not make sense to me.  Since TeX is not complaining
about a missing texnansi-ugmr8a.tfm, there must be one on your system,
somewhere.

My next idea is that there is also a texnansi-ugmr8a.vf, and that
"virtual font" (DEK's name, not our choice :) which refers to
texnansi-raw-ugmr8a.  I won't try to explain virtual fonts here :).

    So from what you said, this sounds like a bug in the distribution. 

Yes.

    can confirm that indeed there should be some entry for texnansi-raw-ugmr8a,

So it would seem.  There should also be a texnansi-raw-ugmr8a.tfm.  
(There is also no need to use these "raw" files, so they are unnecessarily
complicating matters.)

    I still get exactly the same error when I run the pdftex command..

I wouldn't expect texnansi-ugmr8a to work.  The standard tfm names for
the Garamond package don't look like texnansi-<something>, but rather
ugmr<something>.  Do you have more ugmr entries in pdftex.map now?  (I
hope.)  If so, try using one of those.

(The texnansi- naming convention comes from ConTeXt, and I see a couple
of related tfm's by that name in ConTeXt, but not these particular
ones.  Hmm.)

    Does filing a bug report against gutsy sound like a reasonable thing to do?
    I mean, it sure looks to me like gutsy has installed a tfm file for a font

It looks that way to me too.

Happy typesetting,
Karl

As far as I can tell now, actually because it doesn't exist.

>What's the easiest way to use single Cyrillic characters (e.g., "sha" for the
>Shafarevich-Tate group) as operator-like entities in math mode in LaTeX?

It turned out none of the answers I got were correct. The correct solution is a mere four lines of code:

 \DeclareFontFamily{U}{wncy}{}
 \DeclareFontShape{U}{wncy}{m}{it}{<->wncyi10}{}
 \DeclareSymbolFont{UWCyr}{U}{wncy}{m}{it}
 \DeclareMathSymbol{\hol}{\mathalpha}{UWCyr}{"10}

This sets up the "Yu" character as \hol. Consulting a font table (e.g., in the AMS manual for AMSFonts 2.2) one can set up others.

Thanks to Barbara Beeton for providing me with an "obsolete" AMS style file (not distributed with AMSFonts currently) that provided half the answer.

It's too bad the present font scheme is so arcane. Doing the same thing required only one line of code under NFSS 1 (c. 1992).

Message-ID: <aacbe7ce0712121239x33ee0852h8f0f0d0038274bf8@mail.gmail.com>

Dear TeXhax-ers,

In order to compensate for the lack of non-aligning figures, some
typography books suggest typesetting the figures at a slightly smaller
(say, 1pt) size than the other characters.  This reduces the problem
that aligning figures look as heavy as capitals in running text.

Does anyone have good suggestions for achieving this in (la)tex? I
could not find packages to do this, and I am still in the process of
learning to understand font handling in Latex.

Any hints or comments on the (in)feasibility of the idea are welcome.

Best,

Hi All,

The following latex/tex code works fine, however swapping lines A, and B,
makes it fail.

The \myglossabbr{TL}{TeX Live 2005{TL} defines a macro \TL/ which produces
"Tex Live 2005 (TL)" on the first use and TL on subsequent uses and
accumulates items
in a glossary list:   TL --- TeX Live 2005. etc.  Without the \cite{}
in the second
argument, everything is fine, however the \cite{} produces problems. I
figure I've
broken some latex law somewhere, any ideas?

I tried finding a solution, but nothing came up in regard to changing

I'm sure there must be something obvious which I'm overlooking, so I

been able to achieve this using LaTeX2e with \marginpar and judicious  
manual insertion of \reversemarginpar incantations on recto pages --  
but it's hardly an elegant solution.  So I was wondering if there is  
a way of turning off the normally desirable behaviour of \marginpar  
placing the marginal material in the outside margin in two-sided mode?

Subject: [texhax] How to align paragraphs on verso with paragraphs on facing

Message-ID: <476266C0.3040808@uit.co.uk>

How can I align paragraphs on the verso with paragraphs on the
facing recto page, like this:

          verso               recto

    |                  | 333 33333 333333 |

    | four             |                  |
    +------------------+------------------+

Why you'd want to do this:

1. Explaining a program: the code is on the right,
    and the text explaining it is on the left.

2. Translation of a foreign language: original
    on the left, translation on the right.

3. Cooking recipes: list of ingredients on the
    left, instructions on the right.  (Only a
    few cookery books use this; they list the ingred.
    in order of use; and usually it's typeset on
    a single page, where you could use a table
    to do this sort of layout.)

I need it for (1), i.e. program descriptions.
I can't use a table as in (3) because the listing
has to be on a page by itself.

	Thanks,
	Niall

Subject: [texhax] delay footnotes
Message-ID: <20071214140938.85706FAC97A@as220.org>


Hello all:

Is there a way to signal to LaTeX that you don't want any more footnotes
in this column?  I have a document with little author blurbs at the
bottom of columns.  I don't like the way it looks when a footnote and an
author blurb wind up at the bottom of the same column, and I wonder if
there's an easy way to say put this footnote in the next column
instead.  My attempts to figure this out haven't borne fruit yet.

Any suggestions?

Many thanks,

 -tom

What are the names and locations of some Hebrew fonts?

I haven't been able to find a font catalog and doing a scan of both the 
MiKTeX and TeXLive 2007 distributions gives me only one hit, namely Alan 
Hoenig's Makor System, which, unfortunately, does not have the right 
appearance for my application.

Many thanks for any and all feedback.

Greetings,

That is an interesting problem.  Here's why it's hard:  TeX parses  
the input as a single stream of tokens.  It basically converts the  
tokens into words, words into lines, then lines into  pages.  At the  
end of each page it forgets everything and starts over with a new page.

If you wanted your two columns to be on the same page, then I would  
use a table, kind of like old-school HTML hacks.  The array package  
would extend the tabular environment enough to get what you wanted.

But on different pages?  You would need to alter TeX to ship out two  
pages at a time instead of its usual one.  As well as remember the  
heights of each paragraph.  And how would it decide where to place  
the page breaks?

Sorry to be unhelpful, but the problem gives me a popsicle headache.

I think Matt has the right ideas, he's just not optimistic enough.


I'm an amateur. Not a TeXnician. Two thoughts occur. 
1) It might still  be possible to rewrite the output routines - 
chapter 23 TeXbook. My * reminds me to say that all the material that 
has been shipped out is what is forgotten. TeX does not really forget 
"everything" .  Material that has not appeared on a page (yet) is not 
necessarily discarded. Output routines are hard to modify. Better 
TeXxies than I have modified output routines for indexing to prepare 
material for the next page during  the current page  and then used it 
later. 

2) A better idea, (also from Matt...)

Since this design is verso - recto you _could compose each such 
spread as a single  TeX page. You might need to do a separate run 
with "normal" page sizes for the front  and back matter, possibly 
also the  introduction & conclusion if they don't share this special  
layout.  You'll need to think about cut-marks and binding margins, 
but this approach looks a lot easier to me than messing with output 
routines.

Good luck.

This is not a new problem, and I think there are a number of possible
ways you can deal with it.  Sort through ctan and you'll find good stuff
there.

Don't you get an error for \maketitle before \begin{document}?

Don't you get an error for feeding jpeg to dvips?

Don't you get terrible images by scaling a bitmap image not by
small-integer ratios?

You probably get an error message about a missing bounding box,
so laTeX doesn't know the proper size of the image.  If you *do*
supply bounding box information, it may be wrong.

Marginpars always on right margin:

\@mparswitchfalse % all on the right

I have this exact situation with a figure environment. The only very dirty
solution I could find was to
- calculate exactly where the page ends (just preview the dvi file)
- insert a \newpage in that exact location (no visible change in the dvi file)
- move the code for the table/figure immediately after the /newpage command and
use the [h] option


Alterantively, you can play with the [p] option and see where that takes you.
Like I said this is dirty and I don't like this solution, but it does the trick.
I'm curious about more clever and experienced advice.

hth,
Adrian

then the first table is too big and latex moves it and all the
following ones to the end of the chapter. You can try

\begin{table}[!htb]
\caption{...}
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
  ... your tabular ... }
\end[table}

I use xelatex / xetex instead of the standard tex / latex.

This has the advantage of being able to use any true type and open type fonts 
that are installed in your system.  

So you can use your favourite true type or open type hebrew font.

its counterpart, latin capital letter g with cedilla is processed
just fine), so that "\v g" has to be used instead.

Here's a small file that shows the bug-

http://edev.uk.to/tmp/test.ltx

# latex test.ltx
...
! Package ucs Error: Unknown Unicode character 291 = U+0123,
(ucs)                possibly declared in uni-1.def.
(ucs)                Type H to see if it is available with options.
...

I'm using texlive distribution from 20070212;

- is it possible to fix it so that all would be nice and fine for the
  next distro?
- would it be possible to fix it manually now, so that it'd stop nagging me?

Thanks,

Einars.

Impossible, the conversion from LaTex til final output is a oneway 
process, it is generally not possible to reverse it.

If one has a PDF one might get the text out of it, but there is going to 
be a lot of handediting afterwards.

It would have been a lot easier if you wanted the conversion in the other 
direction.

The only general approach is to extract the raw text (a built in in 
capacity in some PDFs, a job for optical character recognition in TIFF) 
and then insert the necessary LaTeX commands.  PDF has almost no concept 
of logical structure, and TIFF has none at all.  Logical structure is 
something you have to apply yourself if you start with the absence of 
logical structure.  I suppose you could derive paragraphs, headers, 
quotation and annotation blocks from the appearance of a PDF by some 
fairly shaky heuristics, but I wouldn't want to count on it.  Even RTF, 
even it its present bloated and top-heavy form gives you a better start.

Subject: [texhax] Persistent widowed headings
Message-ID: <20071218185313.263a5bb5.padawan12@obiwannabe.co.uk>


I have a problem of very frequent widow section headings. I have
tried increasing the widowpenalty all the way up to 10000 but it
has no effect. This seems to indicate another problem.

It always happens in the context of a heading, followed immediately by a parpic. 

example code

\subsection{Cosine panner}
\pargraf{images/pd2/pan/cospanner}{cos-sin law panner}{fig::cossinpan}{0.6}{r}{12pt}
\noindent
While the square law panner gives a correct amplitude reduction for center 
position it has a problem of its own. The curve of $\sqrt{A}$ is perpendicular

where \pargraf is


% Main side graphic, left or right
\newcommand{\pargraf}[6]{
\captionsetup{font=footnotesize, labelfont=bf}
\piccaption{#2\label{#3}}
\pichskip{#6}
\parpic[#5]{\includegraphics[angle=0, scale=#4]{#1}}
}

This really has me stumped and I welcome any help.
Thankyou,

The first thing to do is to find out whether the format file is
created successfully.  Since mktexfmt is not very verbose you better
create it manually:

  texconfig init latex

If this works and latex.fmt can't still be found, run texhash.

If this solves your problem then please run

   kpsewhich texmf.cnf

which tells you which config file is used and then send me this file.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] Nested enumeration.
Message-ID: <BEE697E1-AC4A-42EE-962F-CFE66B4ADFC5@auckland.ac.nz>


I want to produce a nested set of lists numbered in an ``i.j'' style.
I.e. I want something like

	1. Blah.
            1.1 blah
            1.2 blah blah

	2. Blah Blah.
	   2.1 blah
            2.2 blah blah
            2.3 blah blah blah

	3. Blah Blah Blah
		<etc>

The package ``enumerate'' does not, as far as I can gather, provide this
sort of ``within'' numbering.

The package ``chngcntr'' almost does what I want; if use this package  
and
issue the command \counterwithin{enumii}{enumi} I get the desired result
except that the item numbers in the sublists are enclosed in  
parentheses.
I.e. I get ``(2.1)'' rather than ``2.1''.

Is there any (simple! --- I'm not a very good tex-hacker!) way of
suppressing these parentheses?

		cheers,

			Rolf Turner

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0712191929210.13391@msr03.math.mcgill.ca>

The funny behavior is clear from the example below:

  $$  \vbox{\hrule height 100pt width 1pt}\eqno(*) $$
  $$  \vtop{\hrule height 100pt width 1pt}\eqno(*) $$
  $$  \vcenter{\hrule height 100pt width 1pt}\eqno(*) $$
              \bye

a plain tex file.  The first one aligns the eqno with the bottom of the 
rule, as expected and the third one aligns it along the center, also as 
expected.  But the second one also aligns it with the bottom, not the top 
of the rule, not as I expect at any rate.  The problem I have is not, of 
course, with rules, but with xy-pic diagrams, but it is evidently not an 
xy-pic problem.  But any solution that involves giving the rules depth 
instead of height is not relevant.

That's exactly what I needed; thank you very much.

To elaborate slightly for those who, like myself, struggle with these  
things:

After putting \usepackage{enumitem} in the preamble, add the command:

\setenumerate[2]{label=\theenumi.\arabic*}

and that will give numbering of nested enumerate environments exactly as
I wanted.  Note that endless varieties of labelling styles may be  
obtained
in a similar fashion.  The documentation file enumitem.pdf gives lots of
detail and is lucidly written.  (The author, whose first language is  
apparently
Spanish, apologises quite unnecessarily for his English, which is  
actually
excellent.)

The argument ``2'' inside the square brackets refers to the second level
(inner) enumerate environment; ``\theenumi'' refers to the counter  
for the
outer enumerate environment which is called ``enumi''.

Thanks again.

		cheers,

			Rolf Turner

\vtop aligns the baseline of the first line in a box with the next
baseline. So its doing
what it is supposed to do.

Subject: [texhax] old script font
Message-ID: <200712200618.lBK6IGM24735@tug.org>

Ther is an old script font that was popular in math books published in the 50s, 60s, and at least into the early 70s. Example letters "B", "T", "U", "A", and a few others can be seen in Kelley's Genreal Topology (e.g., p.46 has "B" and "T"). It is also found in Simmons's Topology and Modern Analysis, Baum's Elementary Topology, and the table of contents (but not the text!) of Rickert's Banach Algebras.

How do I find out what font this is, and whether a form suitable for use with LaTeX exists?

Dear Phil,

You might get more people to see your example if you scan the page  
and post it to a website like photobucket.com or imageshack.us.  The  
Kelley and Simmons books where missing from our library, the Baum was  
not in our catalog, but I did find the Rickart [1].  I guess you're  
looking for the font of the "B" in the line "A.1.1. The algebras B 
(X) ..."

I thought I had seen a script font like this; but I seem to be  
mistaken.  I looked in the LaTeX Font Catalogue [2] and the  
comprehensive symbol guide [3], but I didn't find anything like it.    
Maybe some of the font experts know.

If you're looking for the font used in the Rickart text (like on page  
278), then the mathrsfs package and the \mathscr command work pretty  
well.

Well, as soon as I get to a scanner I was planning to do that. But I don't have one of my own, and it's a long way to the nearest one right now.

Yes.

Yes. I tried both first and posted after they and the FAQ produced no leads.

Hi:

Others may have more useful advice, but here's a little bit.  If the
source is XML, then it's probably functional markup ("paragraph" and
"section" instead of "text this big" and "this color").  If so, you will
want LaTeX, which is more or less the functional-markup version.
There's also ConTeXt, which I think is also functional, but I don't know
enough about that to tell you much, beyond that it's more modern, and is
on my list to learn.

See if your library has a copy of Rookledge's International Type-Finder.

Christopher Perfect & Gordon Rookledge, (PBC International: New York 1983)

It isn't perfect, but it is pretty good on typefaces from just the 
period you are interested in.

Once you have the name of the font, you will still have to see whether 
there is a Type1 (or---sigh---a TrueType) version of it, but at least 
you will have something to start from.

Yeah, I'd agree.  If you "get" XML than XSLT is pretty darn good.  I  
read the book by Tidwell (O'Reilly & Assoc.) and that made it easier  
to learn.  I also use the website

http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/default.asp

It has lots of examples and interactive widgets to experiment.

I never used Context myself but AFAIK Context is aware about XML to
some extent.  The first thing I would do is to subscribe to the
Context mailing list and ask there.

$$  \vtop{\kern0pt\hrule height 100pt width 1pt}\eqno(*) $$   % added \kern0pt

will give you what you want by inserting a zero height line in top
of the box.

I don't have the old books you refer to. But I have a few old math books,
eg. Hajek/Sidak "Nonparametrics" (1967).

The script font they used looks like the following in LaTeX:

\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{mathrsfs}
\begin{document}
$$
\mathscr{ABCDEFG}
$$
\end{document}

like something like
\tofile{f}{...}

the text can span several lines.

What you need is the verbatimwrite environment of the moreverb package.

Hello Matthew,

Thanks for the reply. I am using MediaWiki (WikiPedia's software) and 
unfortunately that does not support \usepackage{} :(

Out of interest I have MediaWiki running on my own Linux server, do you know 
is there anyway to preload packages ?

Also I dont even know how to run TeX on the command line, can I put the code 
in a .tex file then run tex on it ? I should experiment with this.

Aaron

Great, tried it and thats the one.

I am running LaTeX from MediaWiki, anyone know how/if I can preload the

Ah, you should have said so earlier.  See MediaWiki's own page [1]  
for the full story. You could try using CSS to instruct the web  
browser to select a scriptlike font.  I believe Wikipedia's policy  
[2] is to use wikitext or HTML to render math unless it's only  
possible with LaTeX.  This way the page remains machine-readable  
(sort of).  So something like

<span style="font-family: 'zapf chancery', cursive;">W</span>

should work.  You can make that a template to avoid code repetition.

Yes, there's got to be a way.  The sure-fire way would be to search  
the MediaWiki source code.  The way these math-on-the web programs  
work is they take text, write it into a file, then run (la)tex on the  
file.   The temporary file needs a preamble, so if you find where  
it's written you can just update that preamble.  Whoever wrote this  
particular extension to MW may have built in some customization  
mechanism that would do this for you, but I don't know.

Judging on your next paragraph, however, I think your best bet is a  
solution within the current MW configuration.

In the olden days this was the only way to use tex.  Look at the TUG  
site (see "more links" at the end of the message) for information on  
that.

Hope that helps!

Tobias,

I attach a style file I hacked years ago when I needed to do this.
Looking at it now, I don't know if it will interfere with other things
in your document (like the table of contents) but I think it should be
possible to avoid that by renaming some of the entities.

This might at least be a start...

The following works even better.

$$  \vtop{\kern-\baselineskip\hrule height 100pt width 1pt}\eqno(*) $$

Oddly enough,

$$  \vtop{\baselineskip0pt \kern0pt\hrule height 100pt width 1pt}\eqno(*) $$

makes no difference.

But the first does exactly what I want.

Message-ID: <476BEF1E.6090109@email.com>

I wanted to compile a Metapost file from Emacs, so I wrote a quick 
little function to do it.  I'm new to Metapost, and this is my first 
Emacs function, so comments and feedback are welcome.  But it seems to 
work for me, so I am happy to share it.

;;
;; Metapost Mode
;;
(defun metapost-compile-buffer ()
  "Compile current buffer with Metapost."
  (interactive)
  ;Notes:
  ; - We should have a "save buffer?" dialog if the current buffer is 
modified.
  ; - It would be nice to clear the compile buffer before a recompile.
  (setq curbuf-fname (shell-quote-argument buffer-file-name))
  (if (= 0 (call-process "mpost" nil (concat "*Metapost-" curbuf-fname "*")
                         nil curbuf-fname))
      (message (concat "Metapost compiled " curbuf-fname " successfully."))
      (message (concat "Metapost compile of " curbuf-fname " FAILED.")))
  )
(add-hook 'metapost-mode-hook
          (lambda ()

Message-ID: <001001c844f8$16dcdad0$0a00a8c0@profnelson>

I'm at my wits' end. Let me list the relevant code of the book and point out the problem:
\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{makeidx}
\makeindex
\begin{document}
\frontmatter
\tableofcontents
\pagestyle{myheadings}
\chapter{Preface}
\markboth{book name}{Preface}
\mainmatter
\chapter{Blah Blah}
\markboth{book name}{Blah Blah}
text
\backmatter
\chapter{Index}
\markboth{book name}{Index}
\printindex
\end{document}
    I need the \chapter{Index} to get the Index in the Table of Contents and its ancillary command \markboth to get the page headings right. But it generates a blank page except for the title "Index" and enters that page in the Table of Contents. Then starting on the next page is the compiled index, also with a title "Index." 
   Can you help me? Thank you

Look inside book.cls and you'll see how the theindex environment is defined
- you can redefine it (cut-and-paste) and chop out the bits you don't want.

Or take a look at the tocbibind package.

Sorry, don't have time for more now.

I modified MediaWiki's math/texutil.ml:60 adding the \usepackage{mathptmx} 
and \usepackage{mathrsfs}. \mathcal{..} now produces the cursive font.

First get it to postscript (latex and then dvips).

This is how I do it for my spotmaps of archaeological finds: details recently 
revised.  Adjust the constants to your preference.  This currently runs on 
Ubuntu Feisty.  I don't pipe, so that I can inspect the intermediate stages.

  latex $NAME
  dvips -f <$NAME.dvi >$NAME.ps
# convert this to pgm (I am working in black and white)

I have this document which more or less a container for tables and

There is a logic in the sequence of the elements, and I would like to

Hi,
 
My name is George and the last couple of days i m trying to find a way to load images into my LaTeX file. I searched quite a lot about that and the conclusion was, that i need to have my images converted to a .ps format in order to be able to load them. Since i had no idea on how i'd be able to convert them into that format i searched again and i found out that a suitable Postscript printer driver is able to make this conversion from a jpeg or bmp to a .ps file. Thus, i downloaded quite a lot of defferent types of Postscript printer drivers but unfortunatelly nothing has worked so far..!
Is there any other convenient way that i can use to make this conversion? Your assistance is kindly appreciated. 
 
thank you in advance
 
 
pls note that im also including the command : \usepackage{graphicx} right below  the :\documentclass[dvips]{report} line.

If you use pdflatex instead of latex, you can use .jpg and .png files
directly. For the conversion to .eps or .ps you can use ImageMagick or
the Gimp.

Don't make them JPEG, GIF, PNG.  Make them eps.  Then you can use
standard LaTeX to read them in

\includegraphics*{myfile.eps}

Note that this is inefficient.  You make a page with TeX/LaTeX,
convert to eps, read it in as a figure.  If you are demonstrating
something about TeX it makes sense.  Otherwise, you could just do it
directly.

I think it depends on the situation. I often use latex to tidy up a
picture that is otherwise hard to edit, for example by using the overpic
package to re-label graphs or add annotations or include multiple
pictures. For myself, this can be done directly in the latex source, as
you imply.

But publishers usually want clean figures, file-named by number, and all
ready to be inserted. The easiest way to do this is then to put the
relevant latex in a separate file, latex it, crop it, and then you have
a simple graphic that the publisher will accept.

For those publishers that will take pdfs, this is very easy with
pdflatex:

pdflatex <image-manipulation.tex>
pdfcrop <image-manipulation.pdf>

then \includegraphics{image-manipulation-crop} will input the result.

Seasons greetings,
Steve

The GIMP (Gnu's answer to Photoshop) is free, and works in Linux and 
Windows.  There may even be a Mac version.  It does a fine job of 
producing EPS (Encapsulated PostScript, which you want, because it 
provides you with a bounding box you can use for clipping, etc.) from 
just about any graphics format presently in use.  GIMP gives you the 
opportunity to tailor the bitmap to your needs before converting to 
EPS.  It is surprisingly good at interpolation to bring bitmaps of 
unsatisfactory resolution up to usable density but, be warned, it needs 
a huge swap file to do serious interpolations. 
I recently passed 164 wretched black-and-white scans, which were 
supplied to me at just over 200 DPI resolution through the GIMP.  I'm 
glad the job is over, but I was able to run the resolution from 200 DPI 
all the way up to 1200 (a preferred resolution for black-and-white line 
art, even though it is overkill for most halftones).  The EPS end 
product can be scaled with Tom Rokicki's epsf.

ImageMagick is also astonishingly good, but doesn't give you the editing 
capabilities of the GIMP.

If you have an emacs editor, you can do a very precise job of clipping 
by editing the bounding box directly, while looking at the results in 
ghostview or ggv.

No. \includegraphics{myfile} and let graphics.cfg decide what to use.
And if you plan to generate pdf, use png or jpeg or convert your
images to pdf.

Have you used potrace?  I use it to convert bitmaps and scans to  
vector graphics.  It exports EPS, PDF, SVG, xfig, and a few others.   
It's very quick, too.

I guess it does no interpolation, however.  But it works for what I  
need.

This is all described in

  http://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/english/epslatex.pdf 

(and much more).  Keith Reckdahl updated this file recently and it
seems to be up-to-date.

If you want to manipulate the images, GIMP is certainly a good
(probably the best) choice.

But if you only want to convert bitmaps to eps or pdf,

  http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/sam2p

is by far the best choice.

BTW, sam2p is part of TeX Live 2007 for Windows.

Subject: [texhax] What has happened to PLTOTF???
Message-ID: <47741710.6080509@comcast.net>

I recently tried to check something by running tftopl and then running 
pltotf. 

The two programs are identified as "Nihongo" 

tftopl gives what looks like a valid PL file.  There are no oddities in 
the file as viewed in emacs, but I cannot make a TFM out of that file. 

pltotf appears to run alright, but I when I check the resulting TFM, 
using tftopl again,
I get

tftopl -verbose murr-nep10e.tfm jjunk.pl
This is Nihongo TFtoPL, Version 3.2-p1.5 (Web2C 7.4.5)
process kanji code is euc.
The file has fewer bytes than it claims!
Sorry, but I can't go on; are you sure this is a TFM?

I have tried with some well established TFM files so that I know that 
they are valid
and I cannot get a correct result with tftopl -> pltotf -> tftopl. 

This is a very serious hole in TeX support ware.

The problem lies in the handling of the

(CODINGSCHEME XXXXENCODING + ASEXENCODING)

string

If I change that to
(CODINGSCHEME XXXENCODING + ASEXENCODING)

two binary bytes change.  There is a ^Z instead of ^[ before the string 
in the
TFM which is entirely reasonable, and there are 13 binary zero bytes 
after the string in the second instance, but only 12 after the first 
instance.  That too seems not unreasonable.  But the second instance 
fails completely, although I have used a binary "compare-windows" in 
emacs to show that from that string of binary zeros on, the two files 
(the good and the bad one) are precisely identical.

No matter what arbitrary changes I make in the CODINGSCHEME string, I 
cannot get pltotf to produce a valid TFM. 

Incidentally, where does the "Nihongo" string come from? 

I recompiled from the sources on the 2004 TeX collection CTAN partition, and the problem went away.

Hi Pierre,

    Incidentally, where does the "Nihongo" string come from? 

I have no idea.  It would seem to be a bug in that version of the
programs.  Where did the binaries you were using come from?

Best,

Message-ID: <1199035071.4551.43.camel@sony-sjs.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk>

Dear All,

I have one that has defeated me, but should be solvable. Our exam style
puts the marks for a particular question on the last line of that
question, but pushed to the right edge (with a bit of leading space) if
there's room. Else it goes on the next line all by itself, but still
aligned along the right margin, i.e.,

|blah blah      [2 marks]|

and

|blah blah blah blah blah|
|               [2 marks]|

where | shows the edge of the text. Try as I might, I can't generate a
macro that will do this. It's easy to do the first, but if the line is
too long, leading space tends to get gobbled up and I end up with:

|blah blah blah blah blah|
|[2 marks]               |

I've tried all manner of boxes, \phantoms, etc. The best I have managed
is:

\newcommand\qmarks[1]{\quad\nolinebreak\hfill{[#1~qmarks]}}

which needs to be placed immediately after the question without any
space, i.e.,

blah blah blah blah blah\qmarks{2}

This ALWAYS gets the marks to the right edge, because it drags the last
blah to the next line with it. This makes for ugly lines as tex
desperately stretches the rest out. I attach a short sample for someone
to play with.

With best wishes for the New Year,
Steve

I was wrong, it's anyfontsize no anysize, that one works, get it from 
CTAN, fix-cm was not enough

just add


\usepackage{anyfontsize}

This is a well known problem from whenever preople want to create their 
own proof environments, it always goes wrong.

But there is a solution, use the following construction stolen from 
amsthm.sty:

\leavevmode\unskip\penalty9999 \hbox{}\nobreak\hfill
     \quad\hbox{blah}

(the text part of the definition of \qed), I've stolen this many times, 
and it works just fine

Sorry to bump this, still no real progress understanding
heading widows. Can someone enlighten me please.

How can I bind the heading more tightly to the paragraph ?
(If that makes sense)

I do the following, based on the discussion on p. 106 of _The TeXbook_:

\newcommand{\rtuck}{\@ifnextchar[{\@rtuck}{\@rtuck[1em]}}

\def\@rtuck[#1]#2{{\unskip\nobreak\hfil\penalty50\hskip#1\null
   \nobreak\hfil #2\parfillskip=0pt\finalhyphendemerits=0\par}}

Invoke the macro with this:

\rtuck{[2 marks]}

In a given instance, you can adjust the bit of leading space by  
including an optional argument:

\rtuck[0.5em]{[2 marks]}

all the best,
mtw

Hi,

I have a minor problem with the Harvard citation package, which is probably
quite simple - just that I can't see it and there don't appear to be any
clues in the documentation: 

I am using the package \usepackage{harvard} and then using the agsm style. I
can't get \citationmode{abbr} to work (which I placed in the preamble) but
all other aspects of the package seem to work...\citeyear etc. 

Any ideas please? 

Cheers, Bruce

Cribbed from the TeXbook c.1996. (Core only -- it's part of my proof style, but you should be able to spot the irrelevant bits for your purpose.)

 \leavevmode\ifproof\global\proofendedtrue\fi
 \ifhmode\unskip\nobreak\hfil\penalty 50 
    \hskip.4em\hbox{}\nobreak\hfil\eops[.5ex]
    \parfillskip=0pt \finalhyphendemerits=0

The trick is to make it adjust the last two lines of the preceding text nicely. (The complete style also adjusts for display math.) \eops is the call to my "end of proof" symbol macro.

Hi,

Is there an easy way to get old style numerals everywhere in the

Someone put this into our journal style.  It looks cumbersome, but it 
works.  It is apparently derived from something that appears in Paul 
Taylor's diagram macros:

\def\pushright#1{{%        set up
    \parfillskip=0pt            % so \par doesnt push \square to left

    \displaywidowpenalty=10000  % ditto
    \finalhyphendemerits=0      % TeXbook exercise 14.32

    \hfil                       % ragged right if we spill over
    \penalty50                  % discouragement to do so

    {#1}                        % the end-of-proof mark (or whatever)
   %
   %                   vertical

\newbox\@endproofbox
\setbox\@endproofbox\hbox{\vrule width5pt height 5pt depth 0pt}
\def\endproofbox{\copy\@endproofbox}
\def\endproof{\pushright{\endproofbox}%
\penalty-700 \par\addvspace{\medskipamount}}

I have added the example of how it is used.  I don't actually know who did 
this macro.

With the help of Chris Thompson of the Cambridge University Computing 
Service, I implemented the following solution for my Ph.D. thesis in 1986. 
As well as keeping the square on the right (though possibly on the next 
line), it also stops it from being left over (as a "widow") on the next 
page.

After the discussion involving \pushright and so on, I got to wonder if 
there wasn't a simpler solution.  Perhaps there is a problem with the 
following, but it seemed to work:

\documentclass{article}
\newbox\endproofbox
\setbox\endproofbox\hbox{\vrule width5pt height 5pt depth 0pt}
\def\eop{\hbox to .3em {\hss}\hfill\copy\endproofbox \par\kern5pt}

\begin{document}
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party.\eop
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party.
Now is~the \eop
\end{document}

The reason for the ~ in the last line was to inhibit tex from putting 
"the" on the next line.

Firstly, my thanks to those who have provided input to this question,
and my apologies for those of you who have been distracted by it.

To date, there have been 3 generic solutions to this:

1 provided by Lars Madsen:

\leavevmode\unskip\penalty9999 \hbox{}\nobreak\hfill
     \quad\hbox{blah}

that works as advertised, but if the box is forced onto the next line,
the previous line is ALWAYS stretched to be right justified. This is
either a good thing or a bad thing depending on the situation and your
sense of aesthetics.

2 provided by several of you, based on stuff in the TeX book (my slight
apologies for not reading it) best represented by Michael's previous
commented version of \pushright, or Michael Westcoat's \rtuck, or ...,
from his journal's style file, that doesn't stretch a line that is too
long to also have the box. This seems to be quite robust

3 Michael's suggestion below which works most but not all of the time,
especially if the box is replaced by some longer text, like the
[nn~marks] I originally sought. If you wish to experiment, cut/paste any
of these into the sample I supplied and \renewcommand\qmarks[1] to use
them instead of my original. You'll then see that some of the [nn marks]
end up at the beginning of the next line. Read on...

Indeed, that should be a good indicator that this approach is less than
foolproof, though I have a lot of sympathy with the notion that the
original problem seems sufficiently simple that it ought to have a
simple two-line solution.

Anyway, for those who are better at this than I, and who want to waste
some more time, here's another variant I thought would be easy but
isn't. Often, a question asks to show that \[ display equation \], and
that's the end of the question. None of the examples I've been given
work, I think, within a displayed math environment, so the marks end up
below that, which takes up more vertical space on the page and is less
than ugly. After some trials, I realised I was trying to re-invent the
wheel as TeX's equation numbering knew how to do this. Following some
digging, I tried:

\newcommand\qmarks[1]{\ifmmode \eqno \hbox{[#1~marks]}%
 \else \pushright{\hbox{[#1~marks]}}\fi}

but this gives an error about a bad math delimeter. It's obviously a
problem with the \eqno, as omitting it compiles (but doesn't do what I
want), though the construction looks to be the way equation numbers are
done in latex. \eqno is a TeX primitive. I've also tried hacking the
construction in leqno.clo which generates an hbox and stuffs the
equation number in the left, but I don't know how to do this. I'm away
that \eqno will only work in displaymath, whereas \ifmmode would also
apply to $...$ maths, but it is easy for the user to fix in that case by
putting the \qmarks command outside the inline maths.

I won't specify what behaviour I would want/expect if the displaymath
were in an equation environment that got equation numbers, but my
inclincation in this case would be to force the user to use leqno.

I'm off to join my neighbours in bringing in the New Year.
