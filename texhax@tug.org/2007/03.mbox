    I'd like to specify the 'image' filename and let pdflatex use
    the image.pdf file while htlatex incorporates the image.png file

Maybe the default extension that can be specified when you load the
graphicx (if that's what we're talking about) driver -- you could do it
conditionally, based on whether pdflatex or htlatex is being used.  If
not supported directly, you could hack around it as below.

I don't know of an official way to distinguish, but I surmise this would
do the job (untested of course):

\ifx\Hcode\undefined
  \def\imgext{}% non-ht*
\else
  \def\imgext{.png}% ht*
\fi
...
\includegraphics[...]{file\imgext}

(I got \Hcode just by looking at the tiny htlatex script.)

You might also check the tex4ht docs to see if there's any advice
related this.

Hope this helps.

Hello. How are you.

How does report.cls name the both section* and chapter* command?  
Where are they defined?

Thank you, so much. Have a good day.

Too difficult. :-)

Btw: Lamport's book explaines the definition of \chapter and \chapter*.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0703010639590.30791@prism.math.mcgill.ca>

If you compile the file:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{breakcites}
\newcommand{\etal}{\emph{et al.}}
\begin{document}
\cite{ABC}
\begin{thebibliography}{99}
\bibitem[A \etal\ (2000)]{ABC}
\end{thebibliography}
\end{document}

the output has an extra comma after the citation.  So far, I have found 
two ways to fix it:  take the period out of the definition of \etal and 
add it to the bibitem itself; or alter the definition of \@citex by 
replacing the last line of \@citex
        {\csname b@\@citeb\endcsname}}}{#1}}
with
        {{\csname b@\@citeb\endcsname}}}}{#1}}
(i.e. add another level of grouping).  Incidentally, the original last 
line was
        {\hbox{\csname b@\@citeb\endcsname}}}}{#1}}
and that \hbox was what prevented the citations from breaking.  I do not 
understand why that extra level of grouping has that effect, or for that 
matter why the period in the definition of \etal has that effect, but it 
is clearly a bug.

thanks, this is precisely the type of solution I was looking for.
I did look at the TeX4ht doc and found nothing, I think the author
'always' uses extensions when including graphics.

I suspect that it has to do with the \leavemode command in the definition of
\emph.
Here are some more ways around the problem:

1. \newcommand{\etal}{\emph{et al}.}
2. \newcommand{\etal}{\mbox{\emph{et al.}}}
3. \newcommand{\etal}{{\it et al.}}

I was in a discussion where someone mentioned
that they had a SAS depot on a 4GB USB drive
which they carried around to do user installations.

Q: Has anyone installed any distribution
-- in my case that would be TeXlive --
onto a USB drive?

For security reasons, I do all my tex work
on my privately-owned computer,
as my federal agency has prohibited use of
privately-purchased software like my text-editor, Ultra-Edit,
and free-ware, like TeX.

This seems a logical end-run around the bureaucracy,
but then they are promising to scan all USB drives
upon insertion. 
Oh, and no personally-purchased USB drives allowed!

it seems that you are working in a Windows environment. Until they really

Not so much a bug as an incompatibility.  Anyway, maybe, if you contact the
author of the breakcites package, he'll fix it.

Hi, all TeX users.

After running TeX (plain TeX), I convert dvi into ps with:

 $ dvips file.dvi -o

, then ps into pdf with:

 $ ps2pdf file.ps

. Now, if I print the file.pdf using Linux all seems to go well; instead, if I
open the file through MS Windows and Adobe Reader and then print it, I see that
the font size is smaller: a 12pt becomes 11pt or so.

Can anybody please suggest a possible solution?
I need using MS Windows to print my files because I'm often out of home and
then apply to printing shops that only have MS Windows.

Thanks,
Rodolfo

I suspect that when you open the file with Acrobat, it's shrinking the page
automatically to adjust the margins (to 96% or so?). I think you can turn
off that option somewhere.

How does report.cls name the both section* and chapter* command?  
Where are they defined? or What file are they?

What I want to do is modify the form how LaTeX uses those commands. I  
mean to change the format (font color, font size, ...). So, How can I  
modify them (both section* and chapter* command).

I was able to modify the both chapter and section command. Now I need  
to modify the respective asterisk commands.

I making myself clear now?

Thank you.

I assume that the font size is the same but the document is scaled
down so that you get bigger margins.  If not, run pdffonts in order to
find out whether some fonts are not embedded.  Non-embedded fonts are
always good for surprisingly results.

Did you set the paper size properly?  You can check with the program
pdfinfo.  pdfinfo should detect the paper type.  I get, for instance:

Page size:      595.276 x 841.89 pts (A4)

If this looks well, then you should get the same result at the
printing shop.  If pdfinfo mentions a wrong paper size, run texconfig.

However, ask people at the printing shop to check parameters in the AR
print dialogue box, especially section "Page Handling".  The parameter
"Page Scaling" should be set to "None" but I suppose that their
default is "Reduce to Printer Margins".  This should not make any
difference if the page size is set properly in the PDF file but "None"
is the safest value, though.

Even if you don't have a printer you can play with AR's print dialogue
box which has a small preview window telling you what AR assumes.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The short answer is that there is no definition as such of \chapter*,
\section* etc.; the presence of the star is detected by \chapter, \section
etc. themselves.  What you are trying to do is some relatively serious
hacking.  So what you'll need is some relatively serious manual reading!

A possible simple solution for you may lie in the memoir class.

The longer answer, to help start you off, is again to look inside latex.ltx
and (in your case) report.cls; there you'll see that \section and co. call
\@startsection (note that it may be sufficient for you to alter one of the 6
arguments) and in latex.ltx you'll find its definition.  You will see that
one of the last things it does is call \@ifstar, which, not surprisingly,
checks for the presence of a star and acts accordingly: calling \@sect or
\@ssect and these are probably what you should work on.  The workings of
\chapter (and \part) are a little different, but look for the \secdef
command.

>From here on you're on your own and, as I said, this is fairly serious
hacking.

Message-ID: <200703031800.l23I0GV23031@f7.net>

Dear TeX users,

- Software: as has been previously announced, TeX Collection 2007 has been
  released.  It includes new versions of MacTeX for MacOSX
  and proTeXt for Windows, as well as the cross-platform
  TeX Live and a snapshot of the CTAN archives.
  http://tug.org/texcollection/
  
  It is currently at the production company, and the
  physical DVDs and CDs should ship to user group members
  soon.  Since there was no software release in 2006, the
  2007 version will also be shipped to TUG members for 2006.


- Conferences in Europe:
  The first international ConTeXt conference will take
  place in Epen, The Netherlands, on March 24-25, 2007.
  http://context.aanhet.net/epen2007/
  
  EuroBachoTeX 2007 will be held in Bachotek, Poland,
  April 28 to May 2, 2007.  Abstracts for presentations are
  very welcome, and due March 5.
  http://www.gust.org.pl/conferences/EuroBachoTeX2007/


- TUG conference in North America:  	
  TUG 2007 will be held in San Diego, California, July 17-20, 2007,
  on the campus of San Diego State University.
  http://tug.org/tug2007/
  
  The theme of TUG'07 is "Practicing TeX", and we want to
  especially encourage practical presentations of the sort
  given at the Practical TeX conferences the last few
  years.  (There will be no separate PracTeX conference in
  the USA in 2007.)  Abstracts for presentations are due
  April 23.  http://tug.org/tug2007/cfp.html
  
  The web site also has a registration form, accommodation
  information, etc.  There is very inexpensive on-campus
  housing available, and several hotels close by.
  https://www.tug.org/tug2007/register.html
  
  The first day of the conference will be devoted to
  tutorials.  We expect to hold one all-day session on
  LaTeX, and a parallel session on a variety of topics,
  including ConTeXt, MetaPost, and LuaTeX.
  http://tug.org/tug2007/workshops.html

  Finally, Peter Wilson of his own Herries Press has
  graciously accepted our invitation to be the keynote
  speaker at TUG 2007.  Over the many years of his
  involvement with TeX, Peter has created the noteworthy
  memoir package, archaic and bookhands font collections,
  the Glisterings column for TUGboat, and much more.  He
  talks about his background and interests in his interview
  at http://tug.org/interviews.

  I hope to see you in San Diego!


- Finally, I'd like to remind all TUG members that there is a
  mailing list for members only, accessible from
  http://lists.tug.org/members.  General suggestions,
  questions, and discussion about TUG (or TeX) are welcome
  in that forum.  Of course, we also welcome questions or
  comments at any time to the TUG board, at board at tug.org.


Best wishes,
Karl Berry (President) on behalf of the TUG Board

Dear TeXies and TeX Friends,

this is both an invitation for EuroBachoTeX 2007 and a remainder for
late-coming conference presenters (see the call for papers, below).

The comprehensive conference information, including the *registration
form* can be found at its web site

        http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/EuroBachoTeX2007


The XVII EuroTeX, 2007, conference organized jointly by CSTUG,
the Czechoslovak TeX Users Group and GUST, the Polish TeX Users Group,
is at the same time the 15th Conference and Annual Meeting of GUST.
It will traditionally be take place at the traditional place for GUST
conferences in Bachotek, Brodnica Lake District, April 28-May 2, 2007.

The conference title is

                  ``TeX: Paths to the Future''

We invite TeX users and friends at all levels od TeX advancement: they
will surely find interesting presentations, have the opportunity
to upkeep old and start new contacts and hear about and discuss topics
important for the future and well-being of TeX.

We hope that more advanced TeXies will also give a hand to the
``TeX Beginners Clinic'' team and help the TeX beginners to merge
successfully into our community.  We plan to continue this initiative
following the very good reception it enjoyed last year.


Besides ``standard'' presentations participants are invited to present
samples of their TeX works in the form posters: we will take care of
poster space. Perhaps new ideas and solutions will emerge?

Exhausted TeXies will get a chance to recover their intellectual
powers at the nightly singing and playing  bonfire sessions.
Participate by bringing your own instruments (and voices)!
Nature fans will have the opportunity to enjoy the unspoiled
features of the Bachotek lake and surrounding woods.

The conference might also be a family event: the conference site is an
enclosed area with a safe and attractive playing ground for children.
Please use the opportunity!

To the authors: the full versions of papers for the publication in the
conference proceedings should be delivered to the Program Committee by
March 31th 2007. For details see the Call for Papers below.

Session abstracts, other details and relevant information will soon
be published at the conference web site.

                           AN APPEAL

At http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/EuroBachoTeX2007/poster.html

the conference poster is available. Please print it out in whatever
size you wish and use for advertising the conference. It is in the
best interest of all of us to attract as many as possible participants!


Please note that registration after the deadline of March 31, 2007
will be more expensive.

              See you at EuroBachoTeX 2007!

---------------------------------------------------------------------

                           Call for Papers


    This is the call for papers for EuroBachoTeX 2007, the XVII
European TeX Conference April 28--May 2, 2007, Bachotek (Brodnica
Lake District), Poland.

    The conference is organized jointly by CSTUG, the Czechoslovak
TeX Users Group and GUST, the Polish TeX Users Group.

    The general conference idea is to be true to its title

                "TeX -- Paths to the future"

    The community is putting a lot of effort in terms of thought and
deliverables into areas critical to the future of TeX:

* new TeX engines
* enhancing graphics engines
* new or improved macro packages
* user interfaces
* new font technologies

The results find their way

* first into CTAN
* and then TeX distributions

This is perhaps a trivial observation, but nonetheless important:
in the center of any of those the users should stand as nothing
of the above has any value if it does not get adopted by them.


    The Program Committee does not restrict what your presentations
should be about but would be more than happy if your contribution will
be user centric and oriented towards the future of TeX.

    Proposals for TeX related tutorials or introductions are especially
welcome. If you have suggestions for tutorials or workshops by others
than yourself or about specific topics, please let us know.

    Proposals (abstracts) should be e-mailed to attention of the
Program Committee which listens at the address of
papers-EBT2007 at gust dot org dot pl. Boguslaw Jackowski is the
appointed chairman.

    The deadline for abstracts is now the 15th of March (final).
The deadline for the papers to be published in the conference
proceedings preprints is the 31st of March. The conference site is at
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/EuroBachoTeX2007. From there you can
also get to the information for authors.



                           Call for TeX Pearls

We are continuing the tradition of "The Pearls of TeX Programming".
Here is briefly what is wanted:

   * short TeX, MF or MP macro/macros
   * results should be virtually useful yet not obvious
   * easy to explain: 10 minutes at most

If you yourself have something that fits the bill, please consider.
If you know somebody's work that does the same, please let us know,
we will contact the person. Other details and previously collected
pearls can be found at http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls/.

Subject: [texhax] BibTeX author names
Message-ID: <87r6s3h73d.fsf@patagonia.sebmags.homelinux.org>

Hi,

I produced a style file to meet the needs of a journal submission.  I
selected:

Surname + pure initials (Smith JF)

for formatting author names in the list of references.  The entries in my
*.bib files have the names as "Smith, J.F.".  However, when running bibtex
with this style file produces "Smith J"; i.e. the second initial is
ignored.  Going through the style file, especially the format.names
function, it's not clear to me what should be tweaked to produce the
complete name abbreviation ("Smith JF").  I would appreciate any
suggestions on how to hack this.


Cheers,

In Acrobat Reader print dialog window there is:

   Copies and Adjustments
          Shrink oversized pages to paper size
          Expand small pages to paper size
          Auto-rotate and center page

. Now, I did experiments and it doesn't seem to be any problem if I activate
`shrink' or even if I activate `expand', but there's a slight error in the body
page size if I don't activate any of them. I didn't try what would happen
activating both.

Yes, that works fine. In Adobe Reader print dialog window there is:

     Page Scaling

. If I choose `None', the problem is worked out. The default is instead `Scale
to Printer Margins'.

If you want to print on A4 paper, it looks correct.  Your name sounds
Spanish and the time stamp in your mail also indicates that you are
in Europe.  Thus I think A4 paper is ok for you.

The output of pdfinfo looks good and I suppose that you get what you
want if you ask the guys at the printing shop to disable scaling.

Maybe it's useful to run "pdflatex testpage" and give them the
resulting PDF file.  If it appears correctly in AR and they are not
able to print it properly they probably can be convinced easier that
they do something wrong.

Regards,
  Reinhard

You don't need to hack the bst, rather you should "correct" your bib: the
correct form for names is "Smith, J. F."; that is, with a space between the
initials, just as there would be if you wrote the names out full.  BibTeX
reads J.F. as just one name and so returns J.

Cheers, Phil

Thanks Philip, that's right.  I'll see if I can fix this with awk, as the

I have installed LATEX from CD-ROM, bought with Mittelbach-Goossens The Latex Companion Sec.Edit. My pc is a HP Pavilion a1405.dk with Windows XP. The test with sample2e.tex is ok (latex-windvi-print). But the Danish characters do not come up. I suppose this is a question of post-installation configuration. Neither of the guides which followed the CD (Sebastian Rahtz and Karl Berry) can help me nor can FAQ (nothing about "post-installation"). It is said in the guides that after the main installation is done the remaining steps are to "configure the system for your local needs..." and that the program texconfig "is installed in the architecture-specific subdirectory TEXDIR/bin/arch along with everything else", but I cannot find neither such a path nor the configuration program. Can anybody help me? Thank you.

Hi,
I hope that you can give me some feedback about creating a poster from slides.
This is the situation:
1- I created a set of slides with latex and prosper
2- I have the slides available in .ps  and .pdf
3- I would like to create a poster (a0) based on the montage of the slides I have produced. Is that possible? Is there any automatic way of doing this?
4- What is the best approach:
4.1- use montage to put all slides in one a0 poster
4.1.1- use psnup
4.2- use a0poster dc and just copy the information from my latex prosper file to a0poster file
4.3- use other software 
5- I want a background color

Thanks in advance for your help.
Ricardo

Ricardo,

I've not tried it, but it should be easy to get something out by writing
a very small latex file that uses:

pdfpages      to put all the pages on a singlepage 

and

esopic        to do something with the background (see the examples)

If you're not fussy about the background (or you can redo your slides to
already have that background), then the short route is to use pdfnup,
which is part of pdfjam. This is built on top of pdfpages, so you only
gain ease of use.

One good thing about this is that since it does everything directly with
the pdf's, the fonts and vector graphics all scale fine. Thus you can
either specify your papersize directly or just put it on an A4 size and
then let Acroread scale it up to A0 on printing.

Not a completely tested solution, but it should all work in theory.

HTH

Steve

The easiest way is to use the pdfpages package.  You also need the
geometry package to set the paper size to A0.  How to set a background
color is is decribed in the color package documentation
(grfguide.xxx), but also read the comment in the pdfpages manual.

Thank you for your help

I was able to create the poster as I wanted (except the background). These are
the steps I took:
1- with pdfnup I created a single file with all the slides of my presentation.
2- with the dc a0poster I created the title
3- in the previous file I inserted:
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=80cm,keepaspectratio=T,bb=0 66 595 778]{teste}
\end{minipage}
to insert the file teste.pdf
4- I cannot use \includepdf because it inserts a new page
5- pdflatex, and I have the poster.

However, I was not able to set the background color. The point is that:
1- when I set the background color to black, the slides inserted became also
black, but I can see the other colors.
2- thus, in the presentation I set one slide with background color to white and
remaining to red.
3- the final result is that black overlaps the white. So the white is not really
white.

Do you have any suggestion regarding the background?
Thanks in advance for your help.

2- I have the slides available in .ps  and .pdf
3- I would like to create a poster (a0) based on the montage of the slides I have produced. Is that possible? Is there any automatic way of doing this?
4- What is the best approach:
4.1- use montage to put all slides in one a0 poster
4.1.1- use psnup
4.2- use a0poster dc and just copy the information from my latex prosper file to a0poster file
4.3- use other software 
5- I want a background color

Thanks in advance for your help.

Ricardo,

Firstly, for the second and last time, you get better answers if you
show us what you did rather than describe the results. Assemble a small,
minimal example and include the latex source. There are lots of ways to
try to do what you are doing, and it is impossible for us to guess.

I suspect your problem is that whatever you are using to set a
background colour sets (or more accurately perhaps RE-sets) the pdf
document's background colour, so that anything in your pdf that is
"background" ends up in that colour. Actually, most of the time that is
what people would want to happen if you think about it, because it
CHANGES the background colour to the new colour.

You might try the suggestion I've already made, namely to use eso-pic to
put a PICTURE in the background instead of setting a background colour.
I haven't tried it, but it should be as simple as creating a box as big
as your page filled with whatever colour you wish, e.g, using the
picture environment. Or (as I thought you were trying to do because you
didn't tell us) you can put a real graphic of some kind there.

The problem is solved setting the Page Scaling option to `None' in Adobe Reader
print dialog window, as suggested by Yuri Robbers.

But now, another problem: the print comes out very pale. I tried all the
possible settings and options in print dialog window with no result: please,
can anybody help also with this matter?

I wish to avoid using MS Word and to use TeX in its place to print my
documents, but to do that I need the print to be all right whatever the printer
is.

Thanks in advance,
Rodolfo

Subject: [texhax] Beamer background picture
Message-ID: <19af81400703070518hf562710nbf20c75c45d4f3fb@mail.gmail.com>

I understand that background picture in the talk could be very
distractive and I am not going to use it. Still, I wanted to be able
to put it. As a result I came to the following solution

\documentclass[beamer]
\usetheme{Copenhagen}
% and other customizing color- inner- outer- font- themes

\usepackage{eso-pic} % great for adding backgrounds

\AddToShipoutPicture{ \put(0,5){%
   \parbox[b][\paperheight]{\paperwidth}{%
     \vfill
     \centering
     \rotatebox{0}{\includegraphics[width=\paperwidth,height=1.5\paperheight,%
                      ]{background.pdf}}%
     \vfill
}}}


%eso-pic routine for adding pictures \AddToShipoutPicture* would
affect only current page
%background.pdf is a file containing picture in question


\setbeamercolor{background canvas}{bg=} %setting own beamer background
transparent


% Then as usual beamer document


%%%%%%%
%

Does anyone knows a simpler solution?

Victor,

Your solution amused me, because I suggested it to someone on the
Latex-beamer mailing list who reported that it didn't work; I now see
that it didn't because I didn't set the beamer background to be
transparent, so the picture I inserted with eso-pic got covered up by
beamer's own background.

Anyway, in answer to your question, someone else offered the much more
elegant solution:

\usebackgroundtemplate{\includegraphics[width=\paperwidth]{<your_fig>}}

which reportedly works. Also, if you want a background picture on only
one slide (e.g., the first one), all you need to do is put this inside a
group that contains the frame, e.g.:

{
 \usebackgroundtemplate{...} 

 \begin{frame}
   \titlepage
 \end{frame}
}

HTH
Steve

By the way, you might find Latex-beamer-users at lists.sourceforge.net of
interest. It doesn't get as much traffic as texhax, but occasionally it
provides helps on (or 'round) beamer's quirks.

Steve,
Thank you for your email.
Of course that I understand that better questions get better answers. I was not giving examples because most of the questions were conceptual. I am not expecting you to correct a wrong "{" or a package declaration in a wrong place.

Regarding the background set, I used three approaches:
1- \pagecolor{black} (yes I followed the manual)
2- and the eso-pic:
\newsavebox{\background} 
\sbox{\background}{\includegraphics[width=40cm,keepaspectratio=T]{gklogo.jpg}}%
\AddToShipoutPicture{%
\AtPageCenter{\makebox(0,0){\usebox{\background}}}%
}

Even with the eso-pic approach, what is happenning is that with the white slides the background is over the white background of the slides, but here are the examples:

http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~rlima/poster/poster_ps.pdf
http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~rlima/poster/poster.pdf
http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~rlima/poster/poster.tex

What I was looking for was a solution that will not overlap the white slides. 
Thanks in advance for your help.

I've looked in my LaTeX books and googled, but can't find an answer to
a simple question: how do I center a column in a table when that
column has a known, fixed width?

For example, I have:

\begin{tabular}{| c | p{0.15\textwidth} |}
\hline
Name & Downstream per-device limit (Mbps) \\
\hline
etc.

How do I get the second label (and all the other entries in that
column) to be centered?

Sorry for asking such a trivial question. I tried everything I could
think of before coming here. Some things _almost_ worked, but nothing
I tried did the job properly.

Load the array package and define a new column type.

\usepackage{array}

...

\newcolumntype{C}{>{\centering\arraybackslash}p{2cm}}

I was compile a document with LaTeX. I used amsmath package. The result has
error like this :

! LaTeX Error: Command \iint already defined.

Because that error, I cannot write multiintegral very well. Instead of
amsmath, I also use  amsbsy,amssymb. Is there any possibility that those
error appear because collision between those packages?  I don't know how to
fix this problem; can anyone here help me?

Firstly, all the packages you mention belong to the "ams" set and I don't
believe the authors were silly enough to make them incompatible (although
amstex would probably clash, but shouldn't be used anyway here).

Secondly, there are various other packages that define \iint, \iiint & co.
and I can only assume you are using one of them - although you (unhelpfully)
don't say!

There are various possible solutions:

1. drop any clashing packages that you don't need (they probably are indeed
redundant anyway);

2. change the order of package loading (i.e., put amsmath first) - this
however will overwrite the amsmath definition;*

3. keep the amsmath as the last package and for every offending command
insert, e.g., \let\iint\relax just BEFORE loading it (i.e., AFTER loading
the others).

Cheers, Phil

* To explain this point, note that only amsmath makes the definitions the
"correct" way (i.e. using \newcommand); the others all use \def, which
affords NO protection against multiple and possibly conflicting definitions.

I am strongly biased towards trying very hard to avoid
loading another package. In particular, I have done so
with tables in recent months. Thought many days,
learnt a lot, and it still works, without the array package.
So concerning the posting:

"p" is not the only way to get a fixed column width
with "simple" LaTeX (loading packages as pasimoniously
as possible). Another way is (e.g.):

   \begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
   \hline
   Name & \makebox[.15\textwidth]{\hfill Downstream per-device limit 
(Mbps)\hfill} \\
   \hline
   etc.

It suffices to use that \makebox in one single row of the table.

HTH -- Uwe.

Subject: [texhax] Problem with foils package install
Message-ID: <000901c763fc$9c381ce0$230110ac@colossos>

Hi, folks -- 

I've run into a problem getting an installation of the slide package foiltex to run -- latex seems to be unable to find the class file, even thought it's where it should be (in a similar path as other packages that are running,  Program Files\TeXLive\texmf-local\tex\latex\foiltex\)  I'm using a slightly older version of LaTeX2e as you can see, but foiltex is supposedly OK with any latex version beyond 1996.  I get the same logs whether I run from the command line or via TeXShell32:

This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2c 7.3.3.1) (format=latex 2003.3.15) 11 MAR 2007 11:20**sampfoil.tex(./sampfoil.tex

! LaTeX Error: File `foils.cls' not found. Type X to quit or <RETURN> to proceed, or enter new name. (Default extension: cls)

My TeX installation has gotten a little flaky lately, so I've been thinking of clean reinstalling the most recent version -- does the above look like something obvious (has the path setting gotten fouled up, etc.)?  Any suggestions would be welcome.

Thanks, 

Jim Gerard

This does not work as intended. You can use a \parbox, but I 
don't understand why you want to avoid loading packages?

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

% Not working
\begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
    \hline
    Name & \makebox[.15\textwidth]{%
             \hfill

Thanks to the numerous people who answered my question about using the b{} 
option with tabular that it was necessary to \usepackage{array} in order 
to get this functionality.  Had I read the Companion more closely, I would 
have realized that.

Michael,  that example is given in the context of discussing the

Add the indicated \usepackage{array} and all is well.

the problem is, you aren't using the array package.
the 2nd edition of the companion is a little more
clear in its example:

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{array}
  \begin{document}

the particular code you're using is an extension.

The array package is required to be in every LaTeX installation and is
an official extension of the array macros. I see no reason to avoid
it. If you don't want to use other packages like this, consider
switching to plain. :-)

I'm not familiar with running the TeXlive distro, but have you checked that
'foils.cls' actually exists somewhere on your system?  And if so is the
filename database up-to-date?

OK, sorry, I addressed single-lined entries, not thinking about
whether "Downstream" etc. fits into a .15\textwidth line.
I had tested my proposal with a short entry.
So I misunderstood the intention.

Concerning avoidance of extra packages: This is a mixture
of sports, philosophy, and psychology. The psychological
part is that I started using LaTeX with a small TeX version
and struggled hard with "TeX capacity exceeded".
I also find it somewhat annoying to load hundreds of
macro definitions of which I need only half a dozen.
(Therefore, I have used the autoload version of LaTeX
-- I still do for tests or small passages on my
Atari emulator TOSbox.)

There is indeed a practical aspect for me somewhat
connected with the former:  If I need a certain function
and try to find a package for it, I must study documentations.
The more versatile the package is, the more difficult is it
for me to find the relevant passages in the documentation.
Moreover, the more versatile a package is, the more their
authors tend to explain single functions so briefly that
I cannot see from the explanations whether the package
does what I want. By contrast, I know what my own macros
do (or should do, admittedly, or will do as soon I have
debugged them).

Another thing of (back to) the example we have here: I wonder
whether D. R. Evans wants to have a column of (in general)
multi-line entries. A typical task rather is that you have a column
of amounts -- maybe with aligning decimal points! -- with a
multi-line column title. In that case, neither the "p" column
nor a new column type do. Indeed, what I have worked hard of
recent months is a centered text title (usually even single-lined)
for a column of both one- or two-digit numbers that are aligned
to the right. It should look as if both the title and the two-digit
numbers were centered in one column, while the single-digit
numbers seem to be in one (en-wide) column together with the
the second digits of the two-digit numbers. (Cf. TeXbook p. 247.
-- I am working on astronomical tables by Nicolaus Copernicus.
Even the printers of earlier editions of such tables seem not
to have had a clear idea of how to deal with this situation.
I try to stick to LaTeX in order not to trouble other collaborators
too much.) ... OK, don't be afraid, I am stopping here instead
of discussing my approaches ...

Cheers,

   Uwe.

I know that the array package is installed wherever I work
(unless a new machine has been installed and it is my job
to re-install MiKTeX and WinShell, as last week
-- you may have heard or read once upon a time:
"I have updated my MiKTeX installation completely,
and now nothing works at all") -- see my reply to Martin Heller.

I won't switch to Plain since LaTeX provides a number of handy
things; moreover, Plain would not be very friendly to editors
of journals or so who use a LaTeX variant to adjust a submission
to the publisher's style.

Cheers,

   Uwe.

TeXLive does not provide foiltex because the license is not appropriate.

Jim has the files under 
"Program Files\TeXLive\texmf-local\tex\latex\foiltex\" 

I don't know whether older versions of TeXLive expect texmf-local in
"Program Files".  TL-2005 and TL-2007 certainly do not by default.

Jim, your idea to install the latest version of TeXLive is not bad.
Especially because you don't trust the old installation.  And maybe it
is advantageous too if people want to reproduce your problem on their
systems.

Regards,
  Reinhard

On most modern TeX systems this does not occur very often.

I guess you have studied documentation in order to write your own 
macros? Even if you have to read the documentation for a given 
LaTeX package this is often much easier accessible for the 
average user than the documentation for writing plain TeX macros.

with this method, I cannot get htlatex to find the graphic file.
file not found, though I verified the file, with the correct
extension in the error, is available.

I also tried putting the graphic in the same directory as the
source tex, got the same error, path is right but file not found.

a secondary problem is, if a .png file is available pdflatex
prefers it over the over the ray-traced .pdf file of the same
name. I recall there is a method for ordering graphic format
preference withing pdflatex, but cannot find now.

You can can re-define \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.  This is described
in

 http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf

By default the pdftex driver looks for .png first, which is a bit
unfortunate because vector graphics are preferred over bitmaps.

If there is a pdf and a png file, you can say:

\usepackage{ifpdf}
\ifpdf
   \renewcommand{\DeclareGraphicsExtensions}{.pdf,.mps,.png,.jbig2,.jpeg}
\fi

You have to do this after \usepackage{graphicx} because you want to
change its default behavior.

If some files are not found and if you have a Web2C based TeX system
(like teTeX, TeXLive, gwTeX, W32TeX) you can look into the kpathsea
documentation.  See section "Debugging".  I don't know whether MiKTeX
provides a debugging feature.

  Reinhard

Message-ID: <C027F7EA-DD9C-4EB0-B869-6714CE2ECB2C@alxp.gr>

Hi,

I was wondering if there's any way of executing a system command from  
withing a TeX source. I want to create a LaTeX command that can  
automatically have a given file be processed and then use the result.  
I couldn't figure any way of doing that. Of course, I could  
externally call the system command before calling the compiler  
itself, but for various reasons I would much more prefer this being  
done transparently.

I tried to look a bit at graphics.sty and its DeclareGraphicsRule  
command, which asks for a command as forth argument, put I can't  
understand at which point the command is used and how.

Any ideas or suggestions?

Thanks.

In theory, it's possible.  I believe there have been several attempts  
to do this, with varying success.  Google for 'sagetex.sty', and you  
should get some pointers.  This .sty file has TeX commands to let you  
run a system command ('sage') to produce output based on what's in  
the .tex file.

Easy, As long as system calls are enabled  (pdf)[la]tex --shell-escape
in UNIX-like environments \write18{  put your shell command here}

will be executed. Sometimes it is better to precede by \immediate

This is why shell-escape should not be enabled unless you trust the source

I did not use LaTeX's picture environment for many years and I did not
use TikZ/pgf before, hence the following code is very ugly:

__________________________________________________________________
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\unitlength=1mm

\newcommand{\southeastarrow}{\begin{picture}(0,0)(0,0)
    \put(0,-10){\tikz\draw[->] (0mm,0mm) -- (14mm,-12mm);}
  \end{picture}}

\begin{displaymath}
  \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
    \southeastarrow a & \southeastarrow b & c \\
    d & e & f \\
    g & h & i \\
  \end{array}\right)
\end{displaymath}

\end{document}
__________________________________________________________________


You will certainly find a better solution if you read the manuals more
carefully than I did.  The TikZ/pgf manual is called pgfmanual.pgf.

 http://ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/doc/generic/pgf/version-for-pdftex/en/pgfmanual.pdf

Instead of TikZ/pgf you can also try \vector from LaTeX's picture
environment, but you should \usepackage{pict2e} which allows lines and
vectors to have arbitrary slopes.

You can also look into the XY-pic documentation, though I did not see
anything in the examples which is close to your problem and XY-pic
makes heavy use of special fonts while TikZ/pgf and pict2e can draw
straight lines with arbitrary slopes.

Even if you don't decide to use TikZ/pgf it doesn't hurt to browse the
manual.  It makes as much fun as reading Hans' MataFun documentation.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Here is something quite similar.  I abandoned the matrix environment
altogether and had to place nodes in what looked like the same positions and
thus had to draw my delimeters "by hand".  It's not ideal (nor is it the
cleanest TikZ code) but it looks pretty good.

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline=1cm,xscale=0.75,yscale=0.75]
% main entries
\draw (0,2) node (a11) {$a_{11}$};
\draw (1,2) node (a12) {$a_{12}$};
\draw (2,2) node (a13) {$a_{13}$};
\draw (0,1) node (a21) {$a_{21}$};
\draw (1,1) node (a22) {$a_{22}$};
\draw (2,1) node (a23) {$a_{23}$};
\draw (0,0) node (a31) {$a_{31}$};
\draw (1,0) node (a32) {$a_{32}$};
\draw (2,0) node (a33) {$a_{33}$};
% vertical lines
\draw (-0.5,-0.5) -- (-0.5,2.5);
\draw (2.5,-0.5) -- (2.5,2.5);
% extra entries
\draw (3,2) node[gray] (a11') {$a_{11}$};
\draw (3,1) node[gray] (a21') {$a_{21}$};
\draw (3,0) node[gray] (a31') {$a_{31}$};

\draw (4,1) node[gray] (a22') {$a_{22}$};

Thanks your answers, that's what I was looking for, and for once it's  
even in the man page, how could I have missed it!

The sage method is precisely the kind of things I am now doing, so  
it's what I wanted to avoid.

Krewe:
I would appreciate your considerate feedback 
on the following page-1 template which I have been 
using in my SAS User Group conference papers.

This template is combination of my 2005 and 2006 styles:

Two Macros to Show Calling Sequence and Parameters of Routines
http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/004-30.pdf  

How to Use Proc SQL select into for List Processing

hdSQL.pdf

Q: in line:
\settowidth {\textwidthSection}{\FontSizeSection{Introduction }}%note
space
why is the space after Introduction necessary?

In LaTeX, if you put \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}, Computer Modern gets embedded as
a  postscript font, so it should print fine using  Acrobat.

Can anyone suggest how to get the same result in plain TeX?

Thanks,
Rodolfo

I get:

$ pdftex \\relax
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592-1.40.3 (Web2C 7.5.6)
entering extended mode

*hello\bye
[1{/home/reinhard/.texlive-alpha/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map}]
</home/reinhard/dev/texlive/svn/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/fonts/type1/bluesky/cm/
cmr10.pfb>

It obviously loads cmr10.pfb.  The same happens when I use dvips.

Whether you get pk fonts or pfb fonts depends on the content of
pdftex.map (for pdftex) or psfonts.map (for dvips).  Both files are
derived from updmap.cfg by updmap.

LaTeX and plain TeX are not treated differently in this respect.

If you need other font encodings, maybe it's best to try ofs.

The verbatim package makes font switching much easier.

The latin modern package has a condensed typewriter font.

See http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/typewriterfonts.html for a list of
typewriter fonts available for TeX. If you don't want
typewriter/monospaced fonts for your verbatim text, you can switch to
the listings package, which even defaults to the normal text font for
listings (although printed monospaced, which in my eyes looks rather
ugly).

Hadn't TeX been around and almost frozen for more than 25 years I would 
be sure about this being a bug, but...

I attach the file with the code and the explanation. It seems to me 
impossible that nobody have ever hit the same problem before, so even if 
I hope to get answers agreing that this is a bug, I rather expect to 
receive some other explanation, perhaps the somewhat dissapointing 
"weird feature, but not considered bug".

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.0.8.0703221051050.2970@seagull.bpi.cam.ac.uk>


Dear All,

I have a 34MB LaTeX fragment, generated by Gnuplot, which I would like
to \input{} into a document.  Not surprisingly, when I try this, I get
an error message

TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=some_number_here].

By cranking up the main memory setting in texmf.cnf, I've increased
some_number_here from 4000000 to 32000000, but appear to have hit a
hard-coded limit at this point.  So, three related questions:

Is there any way I can increase main memory beyond 32000000?

How much memory usage, in (kilo,mega,giga)bytes does a main memory
setting of 32000000 represent?

Is there any way I can break up the LaTeX fragment so it doesn't all
have to be loaded at once, without destroying the graph it represents?

Thanks very much

Download from CTAN, install and use package movie15. Works like a charm.
Be aware that you need to use acroread (Adobe Reader) to present
beamer and acroread itseld does not play movies but calls the player,
so you need to have the player installed and acroread (or OS) to know
whom to call (probably everything is configured already). In this and
pdftex mailing list you can find other discussions about this.


This is a general mailing list and there is no support manager (or
everyone including you is)

Anantha,

The answer also depends on what operating system you use. In particular,
acroread on a linux/unix system does NOT support whatever is needed to
make movie15 work. But you can show animations using pdf/hyperref run
links in your presentation. These launch a shell script that will in
turn launch an external player (such as gmplayer). Here's how I do it:

In your latex source put, for example:

\href{run:movie_script.sh}{Click Here}

You can put anything you like in place of "Click Here", such as a still
frame from your animation.

Then you need a shell script (movie_script.sh in the above example, but
you can call it whatever you like) which has the command line to launch
the player. I use mplayer, which gives you pretty good control over
positioning, looping, and minimal window adornments:

mplayer -geometry 50%:50% -nofs  /home/sjs/movies/mymovie.mpg

Then when you use acroread (or any other pdfviewer that supports
hyperlinks), clicking on the link in your presentation will play your
movie; use mplayer's keystroke commands to quit it or whatever. Hint:
hide away your menubar or that will come to the front during the movie.

You may find that acroread complains that it doesn't know what to do
with your .sh file. This happens if you don't have sh defined in
your .mailcap and .mime.types. You can fix this by:

In ~/.mailcap add:
application/x-sh; /bin/sh %s

In ~/.mime.types add:
application/x-sh sh

WARNING: These are a potential security risk, because it also teaches
your browser how to run shell scripts it may find in a (malicious)
web-page, and it will run them without prompting. There are two ways
around this:

I think it should be possible to define your own mime.type, such as
moviesh, and then call your script movie_script.moviesh, with the
appropriate changes to the .mailcap and .mime.types entries, replacing
x-sh by x-moviesh. This is still theoretically insecure, but requires a
webpage that has a script file with a .moviesh ending. You could make
this more secure by making the suffix cryptic, e.g., Ab23_ZbG

The other way is to teach your system how to play movies, e.g.:

In ~/.mailcap add:
video/*; mplayer [options] %s

You will obviously need to teach .mime.types about suffices for video
files.
Then you can run the movie directly:

\href{run:mymovie.mpg}{Click Here}

This is secure, but you lose the control over the options for mplayer
for your animations.

One day Adobe will provide the support in acroread to handle players and
the movie15 solution will work. In the meantime the above works for me
(with thanks to several people along the way that gave me the pointers
to how to do this).

There are quite a few settings you can adjust. However, from texmf.cnf:

% Memory. Must be less than 8,000,000 total.

That is 32 millions words of memory. The maximum allowed, with  
everything included, is 8 million words.

How much physical or virtual memory that equates to depends on your  
computer (16, 32, 64 bit etc.)

Don't know. But can't you output to pdf or something from GNU plot?

Yes, but it would be _very_ expensive in terms of CPU time.  Hence, I
want to exhaust the possibilities of working with the LaTeX version,
which already has the big investment of CPU time in it, first.

The "weird feature" is that the end of an alignment template is
considered "outer".  On page 206 of The TEXbook (between exercises
20.7 and 20.8), there is a double-dangerous paragraph that explains
"outer".  It fails to mention that the end of an alignment template
is treated like end of file for this purpose.  (Perhaps that is
somewhere in the chapter on alignments, but I could not find it.
TeX: The Program makes it clear that the "outerness" is intensional.)

In the example that worked, the macro is already expanded when
TeX sees the "&" that ends the template; in the example that
failed, it was trying to parse the arguments to a macro.

The purpose of this feature is to simplify error recovery
for the 99.99% of users who are not trying to do this kind
of thing.  The only potential bug is that I could not find
any place where Knuth documents this feature.

I'm sorry for my previous html message. I didn't know It showed in 
vervatim mode as an attached file. I'm sending the same message properly:

No in example 1. I wrote that example precisely to show that there is no 
problem in & being the argument delimiter.

I see. However, the problem is no the end of the template being \outer, 
which I completely agree and had already guessed from some prior 
examples using conditionals. The problem is taking the & as the end of 
the template. In both examples 1 (that works) and 2 (that does not), TeX 
is parsing the argument, so in both of them it should take the & as the 
argument delimiter. You may ignore examples 3 and 4. If you look 
carefully at examples 1 and 2, you will see that the only diference is 
that the control sequence \saveentry comes from the template preamble in 
the first case, while in the second is in the template entry itself.


When I wrote

But
%instead of taking the & as the end of the argument it expands it 
(why?), keeps reading ahead
%and gets to the end of the template, which cannot appear in a macro 
argument, hence raising
%the error.

I wasn't complaining about the error at the end of the alignment, but at 
TeX taking the & as the end of the template when it is parsing an 
argument and is suposed to take the & as the end of the argument.

Regards,
Javier A.

Message-ID: <200703232251.l2NMpGgi293454@civil2.civil.ist.utl.pt>

Hello,

 

I have the WinEdt 5.5 (beta 4) installed on my PC. I have also the adobe
reader 7, and everything works just fine when I produce pdflatex documents.

 

I'm going to travel, so I decided to install the WinEdt also on my laptop,
where I have the adobe reader 8. Now, I have this document, produced with
the memoir class, and it simply doesn't work. The formulas and the math
symbols and the bullets in the lists (and maybe other things) are not ok. It
looks like a sans serif font is being chosen for the math symbols, and the
symbols are not defined on that font (I don't know).

 

The WinEdt Team says it has nothing to do with them, and they suggested me
to contact you. Can you help me please?

 

Thanks,

Joaquim Dias

If I make a paragraph using minipage environment, I just realize that
minipage environment has another way to set footnote. In minipage
environment, footnote mark appears using a little letters instead of using
number. Somehow I want to change the type of footnote mark in the minipage
environment; for example I want to change footnote mark using number. Please
help me to do this.

Message-ID: <1174823063.5842.13.camel@sony-sjs.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk>

I have hit an obscure bug/incompatibility (?) illustrated by the
appended source. It seems. The minimal conditions to reproduce the
behaviour seem to be:

use packages:
[pagewise]{lineno}    % running linenumbers are ok
{multicol}

use:
\tableofcontents
\include inside the multicols without any non-included (initial?) text.

This combination results in latex hanging during processing (after the
1st run-through); interrupting reveals that it is stuck at the
\tableofcontents line. Now that I've found this, I can work around, but
it took some serious detective work to isolate this :-)

Steve

Here's the main file:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[pagewise]{lineno}   %works ok without pagewise
\linenumbers
\usepackage{multicol}
\newcommand{\blah}{This is a line of text and another to test various
things I can't get to work. }

\begin{document}

\tableofcontents

\begin{multicols}{2}

Hello  % if you remove this, latex will hang trying to typeset
       % the tableofcontents
\include{sec3}
\include{sec4}
\end{multicols}
\end{document}

while the included files look like:

sec3.tex:
\section{Sec 3}
\blah \blah \blah\par \blah \blah \blah

sec4.tex:
\section{Sec 4}
\blah \blah \blah\par \blah \blah \blah

Just as with any other counter, you can use, e.g,

\renewcommand\thempfootnote{\alph{mpfootnote}}

I just try \renewcommand\thempfootnote{\alph{mpfootnote}}; but it didn't
solve my problem.
The footnote mark in minipage environment still appear using alphabet

Btw, which link you recommend as FAQ which contained explanation about

Message-ID: <000401c76f98$44621820$4001a8c0@biggus>

Hi all,

more questions on monospaced fonts...

I've plumped for Latin Modern for the text and maths fonts and, at the
moment, OCR-B for the listings:

---

\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage{ocr}

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
\renewcommand{\ttdefault}{ocrb}

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
...
\end{Verbatim}

---

I have two questions at this stage:

1. With the document size at 10pt the verbatims looked fine but too big
relative to the serif font. I looked at other books and I think they're
usually 11pt so I changed this and the serif font looks fine but of
course, OCR-B now looks too big. Is it possible to render it at 10pt
independantly?

2. Although the outline of OCR-B looks good it is still a little too
heavy. Of all the freely available fonts it is I think the best suited,
I don't like the ``courier-like'' fonts, they are too edgey. Can anyone
advise whether a lighter font in the same style exists? I am prepared to
pay for it if necessary! I am taking Andy Schulmann's `Undocumented
DOS'' as a benchmark and the monospaced font there is remarkably similar
to OCR-B but noticably lighter next to the Galliard serif font (the
preamble in the book mentions the use of this font but unfortunately
does not note the font used for the listings).

Kind regards,

Jim

Having been designed for a wide range of printing techniques and
OCR-ability after repeated duplications, OCRB does have a heavy
stroke weight.  Lucida Typewriter and Lucide Sans Typewriter are
also similarly heavy, so those are unlikely to suit.

You'll probably find that Letter Gothic will have the look you want.

It should be available from a number of sites, including fonts.com,
Adobe, Linotype, et al.

I beleive the Thesis family may have a monowidth that will suit.
IIRC, he designed several weights for each of Serif, Sans and Mono.

Thesis also has a narrower monowidth -- similar to CM's tt -- which
was designed to set code excerpts in trade-sized books w/o having
to use artificially short lines.  I beleive O'Reilly has used it in
some of their books.

You can search for thesis on fonts.com.

In fact, you can probably do a search for all monowidth fonts on
fonts.com and compare.

Hello Jim,

what about the new ?Consolas? font that ships with Windows Vista? It has
been designed by Lucas de Groot and is very legible both on paper and
screen. You can download it for free from MS:

"For free" means "free beer" here, given that you already paid for the beer.

It's definitely not free and what you suggest is to violate license agreements.

How can you say it's free?  The expression "You can download it for

Exactly.  "only intended".  Now had they said "intended only", there
might have been a problem, but as it is, there is none.  Go ahead
and use it with Microsoft's blessing (albeit a somewhat tacit one).

Message-ID: <20070328042641.GE4310@mclink.it>

Greetings,

I hoped that this information and material were already available
online, but apparently this isn't the case.

I am looking for a ready Latex template for a 6 x 9 Lulu book. Can
they be downloaded from some website?

I *am* willing to make one myself, both to learn Latex better and to
hack things to better suit my taste, but I'd really prefer to start
from something which already works.

If it matters, the book would be text only, with both internal cross
references and external bibliography, but no pictures, diagrams or
tables.

Besides the template or pointers to it, any typesetting feedback and
tip for this specific book format (which font, font size, whatever!)
is very welcome.

Thank you in advance,
			Marco Fioretti

Not as such. AFAIK.

Just setting the size to 6 x 9 (say using the geometry package)  
should go a long way towards that.

My suggestion would be to use memoir or the Koma script documentclass  
--- probably the latter since you're in Europe. Memoir has excellent  
documentation (oriented towards North American conventions and  
usages), and I'm pretty sure the (non-English) docs for Koma are as  
good (and oriented towards European conventions).

I've a list of books on typography which you may find of interest:

http://members.aol.com/willadams/books-typography.html

and also a list of free texts on TeX:

http://members.aol.com/willadams/books-e-tex.html

I also did some pieces which are in my portfolio which you may find  
of interest, or perhaps also my .pdf version of Mike Brotherton's  
_Star Dragon_ which I posted the preamble for to comp.text.tex:

EuroBachoTeX 2007: "informinder"---reminder---appetizer :-)

                "TeX: Paths to the Future"

"Informinder":
------------
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/EuroBachTeX2007 has good news:

1) the preliminary program, with (not all yet) abstracts
2) we have in total 51(!) program items, not to mention other
attractions like singing at bonfires, an excursion (details soon)
the banquet or the performance part.

The conference poster, authored by Andrzej Tomaszewski and based
on the logotype designed by Kasia Jackowski with the help of her
father, Boguslaw "Jacko" Jackowski may be used to advertise
EuroBachoTeX, cf.
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/EuroBachoTeX2007/poster.html

Reminder:
---------

This is the XVIIth EuroTeX and XVth BachoTeX. Interesting numerology:

a) 15 is a nice number for those who are decimal biased
b) the mean of the above numbers

$$(15+17)/2=16=2^{4}=2^{2^{2}}=2^{2^{2^{2^{0}}}}=2^{2^{2^{2^{0/\infty}}}}$$

is a nice number, surely attractive for binary biased (I won't
elaborate on the sum though... $$\sum=32$$).

Such occasions happen only once!

Registration, without penalty for late-comers are until March
31st. Reductions for GUST/LUG members! The hidden message: you can
still join! Register and come! The registration form is at:
http://www.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/EuroBachoTeX2007/registration

Appetizer:
----------

Very much is happening recently: XeTeX, LuaTeX, new versions of
METAPOST i pdfTeX, ExTeX, the emergence of usable DVI-SVG
converters, to mention only some, should make us to stop for a
while and ask where this will lead to and how it will affect us.

In connection with this, M(a)r(e)k Ry\'cko "will challenge the
world" by jumping over "a hogshead of real fire"; if you feel
you don't understand what is meant here---you are
right---clarification in Bachotek, come!

Our special guest will be Han The Thanh, the creator of pdfTeX.
Occasions to talk to this remarkable man and being at his
presentations are rare, come!

Somebody, regretting that he can't come, wrote to the organizers:
"I realize that the density per square meter of TeXperts in
Bachotek is way above the norm."---and he was right! We mentioned
two of them already, and on the author's list are many more of
whom you heard and wanted to meet---come!

All participants will be able to present their TeX and TeX-related
works at the poster stands. Perhaps this will lead to new
developments and/or solutions?

No BachoTeX can be without the TeX Pearls session. Pawel Jackowski
is the Pearls collector (http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/pearls/).

Those who (temporarily) become tired of TeX, may participate in
Andrzej Tomaszewski's graphics design workshop and/or the hands-on
workshop "Handmade paper: a between of handcraft, art and fun" by
Grazyna Jackowski.

Lecture- and discussion-tired participants will regenerate their
wits and relax at the late evenings and nights singing at the
bonfire and not only there. Do not forget your musical instruments!

Come! Join in! Things are going to happen!

I am in the middle of an at least partial transfer of my activities 
from Windows to Linux.  When working with LaTex on Windows I have used 
both WinEdt and TexNicCenter.  What I like most with those is that you 
have a tree structure of the document on the left side of the screen 
and the ability to build a complete docukment in pdf format.  I know 
that the real Linux enthusiasts use vi or emacs for anything but 
brushing teeth, but I do not feel I am ready for that, at least not yet.

So:  Are there any Linux editing tools oriented towards LaTex with 
similar functionality like the ones mentioned above, including 
building complete documents to pdf, including indexing, biliographies 
etc.?

I believe I know several people who use emacs for flossing, though not 
for brushing.

You may want to be brave and consider the vim editor (even better, its 
gvim incarnation).  It comes with some awareness of TeX documents, and 
seems to have much more including the facility to create skeletal 
representations of the file (which personally I did not find useful, so I 
am vague about the details).

I'm sure you will fell at home with Kile

Due to the wonderful forward/inverse search, I'll go with Kile.

I'm pretty sure you can do all these things in Xemacs. Once you open a
.tex file, you should have a latex menu with options to build pdf
etc. Plus you can move around the file with ease using keystrokes and all
the other benefits of emacs, much better than that silly vi

... oops, that's torn it ...

Well, I don't think vi is silly.  It is based on a different
philosophy and many people like it.  A discussion about emacs and vi
will always end up in flame wars.  I hope they can be avoided. 
BTW, I personally prefer Emacs but some time ago a famous person in
the TeX world said: "Emacs is a nice operating system, but it lacks a
good editor".

However, if you advertise Emacs, you also should mention auctex and
the wonderful preview-latex package.

To my opinion the best choices on Linux are: if you're alright with  
Emacs use Emacs + AucTeX, you can set it of course to work with  
pdflatex (but sure if you have never used Emacs you'll have to go  
through a tedious step of learning the basics), if you like KDE use  
Kile, it's really complete and close to what you might be used to.  
TeXMaker, its "Gnome counterpart" (in fact it just doesn't have any

This is something of a failing on the part of amsmath - I can suggest three
possible solutions:

1. \newcommand\M{\hphantom{-}} 
Then insert \M wherevere necessary to adjust alignment 
(This is a useful general trick in arrays - I also use
\newcommand\Z{\hphantom{0}}, which works because all digits have the same
width).

2. Use the array environment - which matrix is of course supposed to replace
- but then you'll have different interline and intercolumn spacing with
respect to any others using  matrix environment.

3. Hack amsmath's matrix, my preferred solution ;-), thus

\renewcommand\env at matrix[1][c]{\hskip -\arraycolsep
  \let\@ifnextchar\new at ifnextchar
  \array{*\c at MaxMatrixCols #1}}

This should either be loaded as part of a style file or placed between a
\makeatletter \makeatother pair in your preamble.  It defines an optional
argument to all the amsmath matrix environments, thus allowing 

\begin{..matrix}[r] ... \end{..matrix} 

The default is "c", following the original definition, and you can obviously
put l, c, or r.

Cheers,  Phil

P.S.  When I have time I may suggest this modification to the amsmath
authors.

Hi,

I am new to this list, so if there is somewhere else that I should  
post this question please let me know.

I am writing a thesis and the layout suggested has text on the right  
hand side of the page with the pages numbered. The left side of the  
page is exclusively for figures and tables with the pages unnumbered.  
Is it easy to force latex to use this style? And what would I have to  
do to get it to work? Would this make a mess of the tables of figures  
and tables?

Any suggestions and comments would be greatly appreciated,


Bryn

Please take a look at semioneside.sty which does exactly what you wanted
above. The package is available at CTAN.

The mathtools package defines matrix environments "...matrix*" doing
just that. I doubt it'll be changed in amsmath as it may break
existing documents.

The first reply to my first message answered to a point that was not 
what I had reported, namely (the answer) that \endtemplate is outer. It 
seems from the next reply that this answer got more attention than my 
original message. Be it true or not, the point is that up to now I 
haven't got any answer in one sense or the other to the supposed TeX bug 
I actually reported, nor any comment. So I would like to know if someone 
is intending to look at it.

 Hi:
I need to prepare a manuscript for submission to the Journal of Geophysical
Research.

I am using the MikTex 2.5
<http://www.miktex.org/2.5/Setup.aspx>installation with TexnicCenter
<http://www.toolscenter.org/>as the text editor in a Microsoft Windows XP
Professional OS. The installation directory for MikTex is C:\Program
Files\MiKTeX 2.5, while the directory path for agu2001.cls (downloaded
online<ftp://ftp.agu.org/journals/latex/journals/for_manuscript_preparation/>)
is
C:\Documents and Settings\Mars\My Documents\TexAdditions\tex\latex\aguplus
(this folder includes all relevant files such as jgrga.sty).

I have verified that my MikTex installation is working perfectly, since it
compiles documents without any errors using \documentclass{article} and
\documentclass[12pt]{moderncv}, for example. However, compilation fails
whenever I use \documentclass[*]{ agu2001.cls}, where "*" refers to any
option such as jgrga, draft, or grl. The first compilation error is as
follows: ! Extra \endgroup.
l.7276 ...T at cmt#3\fi\NAT@@close\else#1\fi\endgroup
<...T at cmt#3%5Cfi%5CNAT@@close%5Celse%231%5Cfi%5Cendgroup>}


I am attaching the *.log file for details of the compilation errors. I'm
also including my *.tex file for reference.

Please let me know how this error may be corrected. I would greatly
appreciate an immediate response, as I need to submit the article to JGR
very soon.

Hi Krewe

I am resuming work on my book
and have settled on the refman class as
The Way To Go.

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/refman/refman.upl

Conveniently for me, I have found, after reading 
Single Sourcing: Building Modular Documentation
by Kurt Ament
that I can develop a chapter using refart
and plug the body into refrep with no problems.

But, since I want to publish this primarily as a .pdf
I would like to add a hyperlink to the Table of Contents
in the footer.

Not!
the refart \markboth happens before I can load hyperref
because I get an error saying undefined string: \hyper at ref

Q: Is there any easy way to get fancyhdr working in ref*
without hacking the ref*.cls?

thanx for your help on this

I've been able to compile the attached TeX file without any error (except 
for the various figures, which you have not included in your attachment 
and some warnings about undefined citations)

Are you sure you have the files

   agu2001.cls
   sistyle.sty
   mhchem.sty

in your working directory (or any place in the system where LaTeX can 
find them)?

I am trying to process only chapter 2, but I am getting all sorts of 
error messages that, as far as I can tell, are associated with not 
having a \begin{document} command at the beginning of my file. For 
instance, the beginning of the .log file shows:

You're in trouble here. Try typing <return> to proceed.

If that doesn't work, type X <return> to quit.

Missing character: There is no A in font nullfont!

A later error shown by the .log file:

! LaTeX Error: The font size command \normalsize is not defined:

there is probably something wrong with the class file.

Since I am a newbie, I am having trouble solving this. Maybe these 
errors have different sources after all? I googled ?font nullfont?, 
searched the FAQs, and read many of the errors explained there. I tried 
erasing all the \include commands after \begin{document} thinking they 
may conflict with what I am entering at the prompt. But obviously I need 
them because otherwise LaTeX is not even creating the .aux file (if I 
understand correctly). So, I?ve run out of ideas. If somebody could find 
the time to sketch a solution or point at where to find one, I?d be very 
grateful.

Not to forget RefTeX (http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/reftex.html).
Demonstrating it has often been the "selling point" for emacs.

Makeindex does not hyphenate words.  All it does is take an input file
(.idx), sort the entries and produce an output file (.ind), which
contains nothing but a set of macros with index entries.  When you
input the .ind file, how the words are hyphenated depends on how these
macros are implemented.  Usually, the index is set in two narrow
columns and the lines have very little stretchability/shrinkability,
so index macros might be designed to set the entries in the
ragged-right justification.  In short, the behavior you observe
depends on the definitions of the actual macros you use to typeset the
index, so you might want to check there (or tell us which macros you
use, preferably with a minimal/small example to work with).

HTH,
Oleg
