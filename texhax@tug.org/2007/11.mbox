Subject: [texhax] News: STIX font beta release, but not yet with TeX support
Message-ID: <CMM.0.94.0.1193879107.beebe@psi.math.utah.edu>

The long-awaited Unicode font support from the STIX Pub Group is now
available in beta test in OpenType format:

	http://www.stixfonts.org/

However, that site notes:

>> Regrettably, this beta test will not include TeX support. We expect
>> the TeX package to be ready for beta test near the end of this
>> year.

There is a confusing packaging glitch: when I downloaded the release,
it was stored locally as STIXBeta.gif, but it is actually a .zip file.

I forced an unpack of the file into an empty directory, and was then
able to drag the 29 font files into c:\Windows\Fonts on a Microsoft
Vista system, and then click on any of them to get a screen display of
a font sampler.  The main font, STIXGeneral.otf, has 2511 glyphs.
fontforge on Unix systems also displays them nicely.

The STIX Pub Group consists of these folks:

	AIP (American Institute of Physics)
	ACS (American Chemical Society)
	AMS (American Mathematical Society)
	IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers)
	APS (American Physical Society)
	Elsevier (publisher)
	(see http://www.stixfonts.org/stipubs.html for links)

Subject: [texhax] Reference in text is too long ...
Message-ID: <47297D28.4050502@ff.ns.ac.yu>

Hello!
I am using Tetex under Ubuntu 6.06. In particular article I am writing, 
I use:
\usepackage[longnamesfirst]{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{apalike}
Then, I use \citep{} or \citet{}
The problem is that one reference (with three coauthors) contains very 
long name of the first author. It has not been broken into the next 
line, but almost fell of the paper. Does anyone know how to fix that? 
Although second and third authors are not named (et al.), the first one 
is making problem, having four string of letters in his family name. One 
way to fix that is not to use \citet{}, but plain text. However, I 
wonder if it is possible to fix that in natbib.

Best,
PM

Subject: [texhax] TeX commands as abbreviations
Message-ID: <20071101133804.GA30426@piper.oerlikon.madduck.net>

Dear list,

in writing my thesis, I found it useful to abbreviate common words,
and to hide others behind commands to allow for central formatting
changes. For instance, \FLOSS is a command to produce "Free and
open-source software" and \eg is replaced by \foreign{e.g.}, just to
give two examples.

My problem is that I have to jump through hoops in using them. If
I use the commands \eg like so, the result is

  "use the commands e.g.like so"

without the space following the command. Thinking that I just make
the space part of the command, I included a ~ in the definition, so
now \eg produces \foreign{e.g.}~, but that seems to produce worse:

  "use the commands e.g.ike so"

as it also swallows the next letter, unless it's a punctuation mark.

My first question is why the space is being swallowed and what I can
do about it.

I found that if I add {} to the invocation, it works: Use \eg{} like
this. However, when used in e.g. a \cite command:
\cite[\eg{}][]{ThisThatEtAl}, then I get twice the space between
e.g. and the citation.

Another solution is to add \ after the command, \eg\ like so, which
also works, but cannot be used inside the \cite brackets and is also
easily forgotten.

Is there a way to achieve what I want: being able to just use words
\eg like so, in the main text as well as in command arguments,
without having to add other characters each time I use the
abbreviations?

Unfortunately, this does not quite explain the behaviour I now see.

For instance, with

  \newcommand{\foreign}[1] {\emph{#1}}
  \newcommand{\vs}[1] {\foreign{vs.}\xspace}

"Variance \vs process theory" becomes "Variance vs. rocess theory".
Properly spaced, but it still eats a character.

I thus went to the source and found that \xspace consumes the next
character and does nothing if it's not in the exception list. Should
it not push the character back onto the stream?

It only peeks at the character. You have defined \vs to be a macro taking  
one argument... Which it then does.

The Problem is the [1]. It means "consume the next item after the
command and provide it as #1 to the macro's body". Simply do

\newcommand*{\vs} {\foreign{vs.}\xspace}

Or train yourself to always write \vs\ or \vs{}, so you get used to it
and don't fall over other commands like \LaTeX which are defined
without \xspace. Remembering TeXs behaviour on commands without
arguments is hard enough, having some which don't need handling
doesn't make it easier ;-)

Yours,
Karsten

I really ought to take more breaks. Thank you for your patience and

Why does \vs take an argument?  I believe that's where your p went.

And if you want to understand *why* TeX behaves this way, have a look
at the parsing chapters of TeX (not LaTeX) books like TeX by Topic
(available online) or the TeXbook (most university libraries should
have a copy). Even if you don't plan to program in TeX, it helps to
understand, which I always prefer to memorize some strange rules ;-)

Yours,
Karsten

Hi,

When trying to print my .dvi file I got that message on the window
Miktex Problem Report in Yap.
I have found out what is the problem: I had to reduce the printing
resolution to 600 d.p.i. However, the document is blurred at that low
resolution and I would like to be able to print it at 1200 d.p.i. or
even at higher resolutions.
Does anybody know what can I do?

We may not have been alone in worrying about the disappearance of 
ligatures. 

Two mornings ago, an automatic upgrade came through to Reader 8 (you can 
tell that it is there because you are offered a new FREE GUIDE when you 
launch Reader.

I tried out all the ligatured fonts I had in a small test file, and they 
all show up fine.

Great cheers.

I enclose a test file which says it all.  The problem is with the 
abnormal size of TimesNewRomanSF.pfa, and it can probably be cured by 
enlarging one array size.  This must have been done for Reader 6 and 7, 
but it was forgotten in Reader 8.

The printer I send PDFs to requires an included header file of 
distillerparams, which, among other things, force the downloading of the 
entire font.  They had problems in the past with flaky subsetting, so 
they protected themselves by refusing to allow subsetting at all.  In a 
few cases this means that an embedded font is well over normal size.  
One of those cases is Monotype TimesNewRomanSF.  It probably tests as 
too large for an array, and is therefore passed up completely.  Later 
today I shall test what happens if you use NewTimesRomanSF as the only 
font and turn off subsetting.
I suspect the whole text will drop out.

I shall recommend to the press that they allow subsetting in the future, 
but that will still leave a substantial number of archived PDFs with 
unsubsetted TimesNewRoman fonts. 

Since Reader 6 and Reader 7  solved this problem easily, I presume it 
will not be a horrendous task to solve it in Adobe 8.

pdffonttest.pdf is with subsetting

pdffonttest0.pdf is with no subsetting.

Yes, in two different ways.

1) MacTeX, the thing downloaded via tug.org/mactex, is on the TeX
   Collection DVD in its entirety.  (Although it has been updated since
   the DVD was pressed.)

2) The core part of MacTeX are the *-darwin binaries and, of course, the
   platform-independent TeX packages.  They are included in the TeX Live
   distribution, ie, you can get a working TeX installation from TeX
   Live -- but MacTeX makes it easier.

You might want to take a look at XeTeX (installed with TeXLive 2007):

Hi,
sorry about the subject but is kind of truth how important this is for me. I
sent an e-mail to the Latex Project people and they told me to send an
e-mail to you. I am from Santiago, Chile, and I am about to get my
Informatics Engineering degree. I have made my thesis (here we call it
'memoria') with LaTeX and I'm about two weeks to print the final work. The
only problem is that i need to change something in the format.

The type of document I used is article and when i have a \section,
\subsection\ or \subsubsection, the final output is like:
1. Section title
1.1. Subsection title
1.1.1. Subsubsection title

What I need is to get rid of the period so it ends like
1 Section title
1.1 Subsection title
1.1.1 Subsubsection title

The same output i need for the header, but as far as i know, the header (I
am using the fancyhdr package) is taken from the section format so it should
be automatic.

I've searched with all the arguments i've imagined and I still can't
discover how to do the period stuff. Please help me. I will appreciate it a
lot.

OK... I've used that option in hyperref, and it's produced a PDF file
with the line

/PrintPageRange [1 42]

in it.

But none of the PDF viewers I have take any notice: xpdf (3.02) and
evince (0.8.2) both come up with a print dialogue initially set to
print all 78 pages of the document, and gv (3.6.2) doesn't really have
a concept of a print dialogue.  Any idea what PDF viewers will respect
the /PrintPageRange option?

\usepackage[pdfdirection={R2L}]{hyperref}

This will not work if the version of hyperref you are using is too old.

This is more a matter of managing the printer than of TeX.  If the 
printer is
capable of no more than 600dpi, the rounding errors resulting from reduction
of a 1200dpi bitmap can be peculiar.

If you have a GUI printer management system, you will have to explore
the various options to find out where you can set the target resolution.
Command line options are harder, but even more flexible.

Since PCL desktop printers far outnumber PostScript, you are probably
using one of those.  Fuzzy output often results from using an old driver.
The improvement in output from my HP1022 when I stopped using the
earliest generic HP driver and upgraded was spectacular. 

There is also the issue of whether the higher resolutions ostensibly 
available
on the printer are true hardware resolutions or software enhancements.

Finally, if you are still using PK files, watch out for non-square 
resolutions.
Many printers compromise on vertical resolution, sometimes allowing only
half of the best horizontal resolution.  1200 x 600, e. g.  If that is 
the case,
the only thing to do is make up a special Metafont output configuration,
if you want to run the printer at its optimal resolution.

I have to confess it wasn't as easy as I'd imagined, or as quick.

This took about 3 hours of programming :-/ ...

http://www.gtoal.com/src/newcommand/newcommand.c.html
( http://www.gtoal.com/src/newcommand/newcommand.c )

I'm a little out of touch with TeX and especially LaTeX so I may have
made some assumptions that don't hold.  The main assumption I've
made is that \newcommand is always of the forms:

\newcommand{\water}{H$_2$O}

or

\newcommand{\ve}[1]{\ensuremath{#1_1 ... #1_n}}

but *NOT* of the form:

\newcommand\topfraction{.7}

If that assumption breaks your document, let me know and I'll fix it.
In fact, if this doesn't preprocess your document properly (and there's nothing
sensitive in the document), mail me a copy and I'll tweak the program
until it handles your doc properly.

I've also assumed that that the input is well formed, and if I do detect a
mistake, the program exits with an error code rather than trying to recover.

The code uses static arrays a lot to avoid heap fragmentation/lossage, and
seldom checks the bounds of arrays.  That would be for a v0.2 version if
the program is considered useful.  Otherwise it's just disposable code.

I do hope it's useful to somebody :-)

Why did I do this?  Well, I've never written a macro processor before
and I thought it would be good practice.  It was interesting to see
the pitfalls of expanding macros
which invoke other macros in the expansion.

		\includegraphics{08_02.eps}
		\caption{Figure's name}\label{fig:0808}
\end{figure}


And it's working fine!

But I need to add a tiny picture (4mm height) of the button in the caption of the figure.
I've tried to use this construction:

\begin{figure}[ht]
		\raggedright
		\includegraphics{08_02.eps}
		\caption{Figure's name \raisebox{-.5ex}{\includegraphics{button.eps}}}\label{fig:0808}
\end{figure}

 And LaTex has returned me the ErrOR:
"! Argument of \@caption has an extra }."

I can't find out where is my fault?
May be I should use another package?!..

If you can, give me please an advice!

Hello. I'm a member since 2000; today I re-ordered TugBoat volumes and 
... number 25:2 (year 2004) was not at its place.

Of course, I DON'T 
HAVE IT, since all other numbers are correctly in their own envelope.

So, please, do I have to pay 10 $ or do You think it may have been a

Please, let me know.

That is strange, because the standard article document class does not

Something in your document or the packages you use inserts the period.
You have to locate that.

If your macros don't involve "programming", then a regular-expression
replace can do the replacement.

If your macros do involve programming, then they have to be eliminated,
regardless of substitution method.  That is, your publisher won't allow
that stuff.

Message-ID: <472EFF5B.8020002@ff.ns.ac.yu>

Hello ALL!
Sorry for being pushy, but I must try again to get some/any answer for 
my problem.
I am using Tetex under Ubuntu 6.06. In particular article I am writing, 
I use:
\usepackage[longnamesfirst]{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{apalike}
Then, I use \citep{} or \citet{} etc.
The problem is that one reference (with three coauthors) contains very 
long name of the first author. It has not been broken into the next 
line, but almost fell of the paper. Does anyone know how to fix that? 
Although second and third authors are not named (et al. has been put), 
the first one is making problem, having four string of letters in his 
family name. One way to fix that is not to use \citet{}, but plain text. 
However, I wonder if it is possible to fix that within natbib.
Hence, in the text where I use citep{Somebody della Something von 
Somewhere:etal:2007}, the name of the fist author is very long and is 
not braking in the next line. Please, how to fix that?

Best,
PM

The PDF Reference lists /PrintPageRange as being introduced with PDF1.7 .
Therefore you will need to use something along the lines of the following:

\documentclass{article}
\pdfminorversion=7
\pdfcatalog {
   /ViewerPreferences <<
       /PrintPageRange [1 2]
   >>
}
\begin{document}
A
\newpage
B
\newpage
C
\end{document}


where \pdfminorversion=7 is used to get a %PDF-1.7 header.

With my setup, Linux/SuSE10.1, the above works with AR8.1.1 
but not with AR7.0.9 . Note the pages count from 0. Therefore
in the above example the print dialog will show the page range
as being 2-3.

No wonder, since AR7 only knows PDF 1.6. :-)

Thanks, that explains why it wasn't working.  But \pdfminorversion=7
throws an "Undefined control sequence" error when I run LaTeX.  Is it
perhaps defined in some package?

If you use WinEdt you can try the Macro Uncommand:

I faced the same problem with my 'cleveref' package. To get around it, I 
implemented a 'poorman' option that automatically writes a sed script 
when the document is processed. When the original LaTeX source for a 
document is passed through this script, it replaces all the 
journal-unfriendly commands with their expansions, reducing them to 
plain text and standard LaTeX.

If your macros don't involve programming, then I would just do regexp 
replacement using your favourite out of sed, awk, perl or some other 
language with good regexp support, as Donald recommends. If your macros 
*do* involve programming, and this isn't just a one-off thing, the 
cleveref 'poorman' option might give you some clues (the code's 
documented using DocTeX, as usual).

However, I found it quite a chore to get it right, involving a lot of 
fine-control of macro expansion order and various catcode manipulation 
tricks, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if various parts of my ugly 
code could be improved a lot by a true LaTeX guru. So I wouldn't 
recommend going this route unless you're likely to reuse your macros 
frequently.

HTH,

Toby

If you have an old version of pdftex, try \pdfoptionpdfminorversion=7.

Thanks for the clue.  Martin gave me the same advice off-list.  It
succeeded in suppressing the error message, but still left the first
line of the output saying %PDF-1.3.

However, I've since discovered, with a toy document, that I
successfully get %PDF-1.7 if I compile with pdflatex, instead of my
usual tactic of latex followed by dvipdf.  (It's not straightforward
to do this with my real document, because I'm a heavy user of
postscript specials.)  Xpdf and Evince still ignore the
/PrintPageRange directive, though.

If you are familiar with PostScript, look out for an operator
"pdfmark" which allows you to move information to PDF files.

See 

    http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdfmark_reference.pdf

but you'll find much more if you google for "pdfmark".

Sorry, the last sentence might sound a bit funny, but curiously in
German we have the (probably unofficial) word "googeln", which means
"to google".  That's awful.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It's not that easy.  The problem lies in macro bodies which use
previously defined macros.  Remember, the macro calls in a macro body
are expanded at the place where the macro is used, not where it is
defined.  I think this is an insurmountable problem for the text
editor model, or at the very least requires several passes over the
file.

This is relatively easy to process with an editor:

\newcommand{\first}{Hello}
\newcommand{\second}{This is the second macro which invokes \first}
\newcommand{\third}{This is the third macro which invoked \second}
\third

This is a little tricker:

\newcommand{\third}{This is the third macro which invokes \second}
\newcommand{\second}{This is the second macro which invokes \first}
\newcommand{\first}{Hello}
\third


And good luck with this!:

\newcommand{\first}[1]{Hello #1}
\newcommand{\second}[2]{#1{#2}}
\newcommand{\third}{\second{\first}{World}}
\third

which is why you need a proper macro processor that works similarly to
TeX.  (and yes, the quick hack I posted last night does get that final
case correct, thank goodness :-) )

Subject: [texhax] Rotating tables in pdf
Message-ID: <472F579C.4000704@phys.jyu.fi>

Dear all,

I was wondering if you could help me solve the following problem.

I have two tables that I'm displaying in landscape format. For this I 
use \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} and \usepackage[dvips]{rotating} in the 
preamble and the sidewaystable environment for the tables themselves. 
The output looks fine in ps format. In pdf format, however, the tables 
are placed correctly on the pages, but the pages themselves are shown in 
the landscape orientation (they stick out, so to speak).

What could I do to fix this? As I'm using pstricks commands elsewhere, I 
think I may need to keep the [dvips]-option in the packages above, but 
perhaps you know better how to make everything work.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Diego (using texlive-full in Ubuntu 7.10)

I don't know a complete solution, but it seems to be that Adobe is
trying to make their display 'smart'.  It detects the rotate
PostScript command and rotates the image.  The way I got around it in
my PostScript code was by changing

   90 rotate

to

   45 rotate 45 rotate

as their 'smart' program isn't SO smart as to add the two rotations
...  and this solved the problem for me!

A solution would be to ask Adobe to not be so darn 'smart'.

I think the verb "to Google" has entered many languages
(it has certainly entered British English).  There are
good precedents, however, such as "to Hoover".

with software for handling highlighting of LaTex code which is not

Folks,

I'm trying to finish my dissertation, and seem to run into a problem 
with margins. I'm using MikTex and TeXnicCenter, and no, I'm not 
super-TeX savvy (so please try to be specific in your suggestions :)). 
Essentially my margins are all screwy and uneven - the left is much 
bigger than the right, and the bottom much bigger than the top.

\documentclass[letterpaper,twoside,12pt]{report}
\usepackage[top=1in,bottom=1in,left=1in,right=1in]{geometry}

I have tried \usepackage{fullpage}, and also setting
\oddsidemargin -10pt
\evensidemargin 0pt
\textwidth 6.5in

but none of the solutions produce the correct margins. Help! I'm getting 
ready to submit, and could use one less thing to stress out about.

Cheers,
Karthik

Hi folks,

please see the attached screenshot. Can anyone tell me why the 2.5
section title wraps to the next line, when the word would *clearly*
fit on the first line?

Is there anything I can do against it, so that the title appears in
a single line?

I'm quite surprised that your searches has not send you to the listings

Hi Karthik,

That's absolutely correct!  You might try to correct  
this behavior using geometry as you suggested, but you
shouldn't do that.  Have a look into properly written
(and layouted!) books and measure the margins ...

Juergen

How do you measure?

Are you using latex or PDFlatex?

How do you print?

A little more good news: once I got hold of Adobe Reader 8.1.1, I
found that it respects the /PrintPageRange option even if the file
starts "%PDF-1.3".  So, that's the original problem of this thread
solved.

Thanks very much to everyone who helped along the way.

I would have, of course, except that I cannot reproduce it, and
I cannot give you the entire document. In addition, there are
commercial fonts in use.

I guess I simply wanted to know whether someone can imagine
a reason for the wrap. If TeX would be a little more predictable and
not pull out its voodoo magic as a deadline draws nearer or when
a butterfly somewhere flaps its wings, I probably would not be
asking... :)

2- Latex the file, and Yap the output
3- Leave both the input (.Tex) and the output (.dvi) open
4- Continue editing the Tex file
5- Every so often, or after making a major change to the Tex file,

I have my xemacs window and xpdf window open along side each other.
Once I want to view - I simply hit a function key and xemacs compiles
the code and xpdf displays it.  Simple.  There is no need to wait 5
mins.

If you use pdflatex there are a variety of ways to do this. I'm most
familiar with the linux ones. Personally, I use kpdf as my previewer, as
by default it watches a file for changes and will automatically reload
it (to the same page, magnification, etc.) if the file changes. Then any
decent editor with an embedded terminal will make it easy to edit and
whenever you wish repeat the pdflatex command (I use kate).

Other strategies, copied from previous postings to texhax, include:

pdf previewing
===============
xpdf will take a stroke of the "r" key and reload the file to the same
page and location.
A posting to texhax provides the following:

start it by using

xpdf -remote key file.pdf &

then compile your document using something like

pdflatex file.tex && xpdf -remote key -reload

then xpdf automatic reloads whenever pdflatex is done.

Nice! And if you give a -raise option as well, xpdf will try to raise
the window (in kde 3.3 it seems simply to prompt you to raise it).

Another posting gives the following acroread tip:

Ctrl-W to close the doc
Alt-left to reopen the previous view (which has to reload the doc, but
positions it and goes to the same spot & magnification).

Hi Steve,
it's a pity that the original question was about Yap, a Windows
program.  It's even more a pity that AFAIK nobody had been able to
provide Windows binaries for xpdf (or xdvi...).

I'm forced to use Windows at work but I silently installed Cygwin
which provides all the nice UNIX programs which make life so much
easier.  Cygwin provides an X11 server, which means that programs like
xpdf or xdvi work properly even on a Windows machine.

Thanks for the detailed description, though.  As a Linux user I
appreciate it very much.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Sirs:

I am trying to install the 'makor' CTAN package into my MacTeX  
installation taken from the TeXLive 2007 DVD.  The final step is to  
copy the contents of the psfonts.mkr2 file into the psfonts.map file  
of my distribution.  However, that file has instructions at the top to  
edit the updmap.cfg file instead.  I'm not sure what to add to that  
configuration file.  It looks a bit bare compared to the psfonts.mkr2  
file.

Can anyone give me a step-by-step method for installing this package?

Respectfully,
Eric Jablow

More or less. For example, in

http://osdir.com/ml/openoffice.devel.general/2006-08/msg00003.html

says ``... when installing on TeTeX 3.0, instead of following the  
directions given and putting psfonts.mkr2 into your psfonts.map, the  
correct procedure is to run:
updmap --enable MixedMap /path/to/psfonts.mkr2''

What you really need in these days is

sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=psfonts.mkr2

(I'm not sure if it is a mixed map; from what I see in

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hebrew/makor/tex/makor2/ 
psfonts.mkr2

it looks to me as map, not mixed map, but I may be wrong. What I'm  
*really* sure is that you need `` sudo updmap-sys ...'', not only ``  
updmap ...''.)

You have to tell us where have you installed all the files, including  
psfonts.mkr2.

I would advise you to join the TeX on Mac OS X mailing list:

http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/

You certainly will find there people who have installed the package  
in the MacTeX distribution.


Best,

Axel

What a very odd sentiment : why should it be
"a pity" that someone asks a question about a
Windows program ?  You may personally dislike
Windows (indeed, from your signature text, it
it is pretty clear that that is the case), but
that doesn't make it "a pity".  Most of the
world don't share your opinion, and some
of these will ask questions from time to time.

Come on, Reinhard, I know you're not a bad
chap at heart : live and let live :-)

I think what Reinhard meant was that it was a pity that Steve's suggestion
applied to Linux and was not therefore a real answer.

Having said that, I share Reinhard's feelings towards M$ and I don't see why
he shouldn't air them.

I had not intended to start an operating system war. I ceased being
dogmatic years ago when I realised that I cursed from time to time every
operating system and application I used; there is no right answer and we
all arrange our systems and work to optimise what we do and/or minimise
the cursing.

I was aware that YAP is a windows application. For the M$-haters out
there, the best way to encourage people to move to other OS's is to show
the positives and possibilities. Whether they switch (or play with
cygwin or ...) depends on the individual's circumstances and energy.

And, just for the record, I the acroread approach of Ctrl-W, Alt-left
works in Windows as well. And my entire posting was a hint that moving
from latex/dvi to pdflatex/pdf has some attractions.

That should open the anti-Adobe flood-gates!

I am typing this from a public access terminal in a Quebec City hotel. 
The keyboard lacks a backslash and it got me wondering if TeX was even 
possible on it.  Sure you can change the catcode of some other character 
(but which?), but you cannot do that without a backslash.  The first place 
I read about TeX, it was TeX 1 (TeX and MetaFont published around 1980) 
the way it worked was that the first character in the TeX file that it saw 
became the escape character for that file.  There were (and remain) things 
like backslash sb and backslash sp for sub- and superscripts on deficient 
terminals.  AFAIK, there is no way of doing this in TeX 2.*.

Of course a decent editor would allow you do this by copying the backslash 
from a working file and using it to change the catcode of something else 
to be the escape.

Personally I don't know how to do this, but if you look at
Phil Taylor's contribution and example files at
http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2005-3/walden-whatis/
it appears to me that he knows how to program TeX
to not use a backslash.

Is there anyway to have each line of text numbered on each page?

Sadly I needed to use a few backslashes before
I could eschew them forever !

This is an FAQ:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=linenos

The lineno package was used to generate the index markers for making  
the index of _The LaTeX Companion 2nd Ed._

Since no one else has responded to you, a google on "line numbers latex"
pops up as its first entry:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=linenos

which provides various solutions. I've used the lineno package quite
successfully, though as the above link will tell you, it can play tricks
and interfere with other packages that also play tricks. Some trial and
error will identify which other packages you use might conflict with it.

How about this approach?

perl -e 'printf("%ccatcode%c%c%c=0 ",92,96,92,47);printf("I like /TeX! /bye");' | tex

Wrap it in a script and you're home free!

Back in the day, with TeX on IBM/Amdahl mainframe, EBCDIC character set,
there was no \.  As I recall, the format was altered to use the logical-not
character as the escape char.  ... But maybe it was used as the non-breaking
space, and the solid (or broken) vertical bar was the escape char.  I can't
remember for sure.

I mentioned Cygwin because this is the only way I'm aware of how to
run programs on Windows which need an X11 server.  Of course, Cygwin
is not the ideal solution for Windows users.  Programs compiled with
MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) fit better into a Windows
environment.  However, MinGW is not a solution for programs which
depend on the X11 libs.

You said

but I didn't attempt to encourage anybody to switch to another OS.
There was no need because you already did so.  I mentioned Cygwin
in order to show a way to use the programs you proposed on Windows.

You cited Phil Taylor:

  > > What a very odd sentiment 

Dear Phil,
you should know me much better.  If Windows users ask questions on the
various mailing lists I'm subscribed to, I always try to provide a
solution which works on Windows but I never asked people to switch to
UNIX, even if many problems can be solved more easily there.

Regarding my signature: It doesn't even contain the word "Windows".
The signature is about Microsoft.  If it would contain the word
"Windows" I can imagine that Windows users feel insulted.  This is
absolutely not what I want.  But it's about Microsoft and almost all
Windows users I know share my opinion about Microsoft.

  Reinhard

And Peter Dyballa has already answered your question. I haven't  
thought of such a simple thing as to copy the contents of  
psfonts.mkr2 into a makor.map!

As he has instructed you to put your new makor.map into

/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/fonts/map/dvips/misc

so you should with the rest of your makor2 distribution; for example,  
makor2.sty, in ctan.org/tex-archive/languages/hebrew/makor/tex/latex/ 
makor2/

should be put in

/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/tex/latex/local/

etc. And remember to update the TeX database with `` sudo texhash '',  
as Dyballa said, after any addition to /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local.

Best,

Axel

Subject: [texhax] too big space after equation with index or nomenclature
	entry
Message-ID: <200711091441.55775.natercia@eq.uc.pt>

Hi

I've noticed an interesting behavior when inserting an index entry or a 
nomenclature entry during the preparation of a book with LaTeX:

If a paragraph ends with an equation the space after the equation gets too big 
if an index entry (or alternatively a nomenclature entry) is added after the 
equation and before the paragraphs ends.

The following produces too big space:

         Some text
         \begin{equation}
         a=b.
         \end{equation}
         \index{Something}

         More text.

But the following produces a correct space:

         Some text
         \begin{equation}
         a=b.
         \end{equation}

         \index{Something}
         More text.

I'm attaching a minimal example for the case of nomenclature entries (index 
entries 
present the very same behavior): in example3 the problem appears; in example4 
the prob doesn't appear.

Can this too big spacement visible in example3 be avoided in a better way than 
moving the entry to the following paragraph as I did in example4?

Thanks,
Nat?rcia

Have you tried just adding the index inside the math instead? I have had 
exactly the same problem, and the answer that I got (from people who knows 
about these sorts of things) is that there is not good way of fixing this.

Thanks for pointing me at this discussion:

> http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=434056

It contains this from Jonathan Kew:

> I seem to recall discussing this with one of the LaTeX team at a

> followed up on it recently.

Such conversations have certainly taken place but, as I recall, only
at the level of 'there are few things that could usefully be added to
the LaTeX kernel to make things smoother for XeTeX users but nothing vital'.

However, just today the LaTeX Team seems to have committed itself to
doing what is necessary to make LaTeX work with XeTeX, at least when
using 8-bit fonts.  That does not imply that we do not want this to
work also with large fonts with lots of useful tables, just that the
latter is better supported by packages produced by those who know
about such fonts (on the whole, not us ... yet!).

Hi,

thank you for the reply.

Yes, I had tried.  It worked.  But in the case of nomenclature it rises 
another problem: when adding a nomenclature entry it refers to the last 
equation before it.  So if I write it inside the equation, I suppose the last 
equation won't be the current one, but some other previously written, am I 
right? That is, the symbol of the entry would be associated to a wrong 
equation.

That is to be expected, unfortunately.  After the equation, without a
blank line to end the paragraph, you are on the next text line of the
paragraph.  Your line of text consists of only the invisible index
anchor.

Dear all,

Is it possible to create a reference to a section (chapter etc) not by it's 
number but using a symbolic word?

It should be similar to the well-known HTML syntax:
<a href="mylabel">Some words"</a>

In the LaTeX code, it should perform the same thins as:
Some words in section~\ref{mylabel}

Thanks in advance,
Adrian

\begin{document}

\begin{document}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{picture.jpg}

then use pdflatex to compile.

Add a label in the section:

\section{Section A}
\label{sec:SectionA}

and then refer to it using \ref

\section{Section B}

as shown in Section~\ref{sec:SectionA}

If you use pdflatex and the hyperref package, these references will be
'clickable' in the PDF too.

Thanks for our prompt reply, I believe my question was not sufficiently clear.
The result of your command in the DVI/PDF file is a link of the type:

as shown in the Section 1

where I would like to obtain:

as shown in "Some words"

and the link of "Some words" should point to the same location as 
~\ref{sec:SectionA} does.

This is the essence of the HTML code:
<a href="mylabel"> blah blah </a>

No matter of I use "Some words" or "blah blah", the link goes to the same 
location.

I hope my question is now a little bit clearer, thanks again,
Adrian

George,

I suggest you familiarise yourself with the tex Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) at

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?introduction=yes

and then look at the the graphics section further down that page. The
first entry

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=impgraph

contains everything you'll need to get started. If you use latex, go
straight to the graphicx package and documentation.

Ah, I had inderdeed misunderstood. You can use the hyperref package for
this too; here is once way to do it:

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  
  \begin{document}
  
  \section{Section A}
  \hypertarget{sec:sectionA}{}
  
  \section{Section B}
  
  As shown in \hyperlink{sec:sectionA}{Section A}, ...
  
  \end{document}

Hello everyone,

I have known that there are some guidelines to create as such, how can I use
these guidelines in LaTeX?
In particular, I'd like to make mathematical expressions accessible and
readable with screen readers.
I'd like to do giving one alternate output using LaTeX notation.
Example, reading a pdf document and will encounter 
a formula that for screen readers tools  is a graphical element,  I'd like
to read it driving the information with LaTeX notation.

Could you help me with some information to do these things?
are there some LaTeX packages for this?

thank you in advance
best regards, Sauro

pdflatex is a program that generates pdf files directly
from LaTeX markup, maybe this is what you need.

Not yet AFAIK. pdflatex can't even make ``tagged'' pdf last I checked.

That's a tough one --- why not just provide the latex source instead?

Most screen readers for example will flatten out the Pythagorean  
Theorem to, `` `A' two plus `B' two equals `C' two''.

As an alternative, you could make a .html document where the  
equations would be bitmaps and the alt text would be the latex source  
for that equation --- Adobe does this on their opensource site.

Hopefully the above will help.

Not really.

You could provide an alternative text in pdf as well. I don't 
know if screen readers can pick it up, though.

\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\begin{document}
The Pythagorean Theorem is
\pdfliteral direct {%
   /Span << /ActualText (a\ squared\ plus b\ squared\ equals\ c\

}%
$a^2+b^2=c^2$
\pdfliteral direct {%
   EMC
}
\end{document}

I just tried that in Mac OS X 10.4 (still trying to find the time to  
install Leopard) and it works properly w/ Adobe Acrobat 8.

It does create some strange text selection-highlighting issues (you  
can't highlight ^2 + b^2 = c^2 in the .pdf), but when you copy and  
paste the above typeset sample document you get:

The Pythagorean Theorem is a squared plus b squared equals c squared
1

(which argues that the page number should have ``Page number''  
prefixed to it as actual text)

Do you mind if I forward your post to the bookpeople mailing list? It  
automatically disguises e-mail addresses so it won't result in more  
spam.

Neat! Thanks!

It's the same in Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Professional.

No I don't mind. However, this wasen't my idea. It is just 
something I have picked up on usenet some time ago.

Searching comp.text.tex I think it is from this thread 
<http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/87c0ea47318e284f/50593ad2a857ddb3?lnk=st&q=actualText+group%3Acomp.text.tex#50593ad2a857ddb3>.

Subject: [texhax] centering a box on the margin line
Message-ID: <20071112183344.GA6578@amtoo.utoronto.ca>

There must be an easy way to do this in plain TeX, but I haven't come up
with one. I have a rectangular graphic (actually a logo in an .eps file)
that I want to center on the line of the left margin, thusly:

============================================
  _____
  | X |
  |_Y_|
    
    |Blah blah margin line on the left
    |More text flush to margin line
    |Even more text and random babbling

============================================
Is there a straightforward way to do this? I suppose I could negative kern
the epsfbox into the margin, or something like that. But surely centering
a box on a given line (the margin line) must be an Old Solved Problem. 
Any help appreciated, even pointers on where to look. Thanks.

\noindent\hbox to 0pt{\hss your graphic\hss}

\hss is horizontal shrinkable space.

You can eclose the box in a \clap.

I am sorry, I did not test while posting. \clap is not defined by plain 
tex. In fact, it is not even defined by latex. In my usual set of 
packages it is defined by mathtools as

\providecommand*\clap[1]{\hb at xt@\z@{\hss#1\hss}}

that is \hbox to 0pt{\hss #1 \hss}, so it is same as the definition 
that you gave. I always assumed that \clap was a plain tex macro.

Sorry for the noise.
Aditya

No need to apologize.  Plain TeX provides \rlap and \llap and it is
not astonishing that people expect that there is a \clap as well.

mind the spurious space, it's visible! Remove at least the 2nd one:

Subject: [texhax] More plain TeX box fun --
Message-ID: <20071114041022.GB10967@amtoo.utoronto.ca>

I now know how to center a box on a margin line, as follows:

   ___
  |   |
  |___|

    |text text text
    |text text text
    |text text text


since \hbox to 0pt{\hss<boxmaterial>\hss} does the job perfectly.


Now what I'd like to do is to leave that box in place, and put a
second box -- perhaps itself made up of boxes -- on the same line
but flush to the opposite margin:

   ___                                   __________________
  |   |                                 |                  |
  |___|                                 |__________________|
    
    |text text text text text text text text text text text|
    |text text text text text text text text text text text|
    |text text text text text text text text text text text|


So given that the first box is centered on the left margin line,
how do I put another box on the same line but flush to the right
margin? (Either the centers or the tops of the two boxes should
be aligned.)

If anyone knows the answer, I'd love to know.  Even better would
be to have the answer *and* to be told where to go to get up to
speed on arranging boxes on pages. Thanks!

Maybe:

\hbox to 0pt{\hss box~1\hss}\hfill\hbox{box~2}
\bye

?

The canonical reference is The TeXBook by D. Knuth but there are 
lots of books on TeX

<http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=books>

there are even several books on-line

Subject: [texhax] Changing spacing between some lines in multline etc
Message-ID: <19af81400711140323n2ed2787fr5a59582fd8d383bf@mail.gmail.com>

1) Sometimes I am not happy with some vertical spacing between two
particular lines in "equations" containing more than two lines (for
two lines {spreadlines} of mathtools takes care but if there are more
than two lines it affects all spacing). Is there any regular method
(except increasing spacing by including phantoms)?

2) Sometimes I want to use a kind of multline but with all equations
except the first one flashed right. I cannot invent anything except
some ugly games with {align}. Is there a better solution?

3) sometimes I want to use \sum\int   as a single big operator, so the
subscript would be strictly below their middle. Is there a way?

Thank you in advance

              Victor

\\[spacing] works also in math mode, so you can use \\[3pt] or
something like that.

amsmath's multline environment by default has the first line
left-aligned, the last flush right and the middle ones centered. Not
what you need, but you can use \shoveright to make the ones in the
middle right-aligned.

There might be a better solution, tough.

Wouldn't that confuse the reader? I know it can be done, but currently I

Works, exactly what I asked. However there is another question

I want some particular multline to be arranged like

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
                                   bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
                                   cccccccccccc

So some combi of multline and align. What is the best way to achieve this?

It is MY reader and I have a right to confuse him/her :)
Seriously: if we use

\iint _{ x>0, y>0, x+y<1}

 and nobody complains why we cannot use

\ssum_{m>0,n>0, m+n \le 1000}     or

\sumint_{m>0, x>0, x+m <100}


???

Hello,

   I would like to distribute a working copy of TeX to students who

a computer on which TeX is not installed?

See TeXlive: http://www.tug.org/tex-live/
Or you distribute a VM for the VMware player.

for the last two lines, use the "subsidiary"
environment aligned:

  \begin{multline}
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\\
    \begin{aligned}
      bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\\
      cccccccccccc

I'm not sure if TeX is still in Knoppix, but it is certainly a part of
one of the derivative releases.  Search on Knoppix and Tex.

Apologies for the noise in case of this being a FAQ, but I haven't found a
source that directly answers this question. 


My book alternates between two styles, theory and practice. Each element of
theory is given a chapter. 

I would like to define a new entity, called a "Practical", existing at the
same level as "Chapter", and in all important respects identical to a 
chapter but for:

1) It's section name, appearing in the TOC and section title is "Practical".
2) Practicals are numbered separately from chapters.

leading to a structure like

Chapter 1: Theory of operators
Chapter 2: Fourier theory
Practical 1: Additive synthesis
Chapter 3: Chebyshev and Bessel
Practical 2: Waveshaping synthesis


My OO instinct is that I can somehow derive a new Practical class
from Chapter.

How might I go about this?

Thankyou.

Andy Farnell

Use the titlesec package to create the additional level. 
Try the following and modify as needed.

Notice the words "PostScript code".  I was using includegraphics for
an eps or ps file.  So I could control the phrase '90 rotate' and I
discovered that that's what Adobe Reader was looking for.  As I
recall, putting '89.99 rotate' would fool it but, of course, slightly
mess up my figure.

It may be that you can do something equivalent.  If you convert your
file from dvi to ps, you may use grep (unix search tool) to see if '90
rotate' exists in the ps.  If so you could replace it:

% dvips file.dvi
  should give file.ps (I'm ignoring flags you may want to use).  Then:

% grep '90 rotate file.ps
  If they exist you will see them here.

% cat file.ps | sed 's/90 rotate/45 rotate 45 rotate/' > fixed.ps

of course if they are -90 rotate you would need:

% cat file.ps | sed 's/-90 rotate/-45 rotate -45 rotate/' > fixed.ps
o

I tested this and used:

cat paper.ps |\
sed 's/-90 rotate/-45 rotate -45 rotate/' |\
sed 's/90 rotate/45 rotate 45 rotate/' |\
cat > fixed.ps

while conversion of paper.ps to paper.pdf caused rotation of the page,
conversion of fixed.ps to fixed.pdf did not.  However, my figure
was rotated oddly and that I don't understand.  (Maybe I missed
something.)

In any case, this demonstrated that I could indeed apply the above
trick to fool the Adobe Reader.

So it might work on your sideways table.

... I tried it on my own table (yours has too many dependencies).

#!/bin/tcsh -f
#(ie run the tshell on this but don't read the .cshrc or .tcshrc)
echo version = 1.00 of fix 2007 Nov 15
# 2007 Nov 15, 1.00: origin 
set rot = 45
set rot = 25
cat paper.ps |\
sed "s/-90 rotate/-$rot rotate -$rot rotate/" |\
sed "s/90 rotate/$rot rotate $rot rotate/" |\
sed "s/90 neg rotate/$rot neg rotate $rot neg rotate/" |\
cat > fixed.ps
ps2pdf fixed.ps
open fixed.pdf

That did control the rotation and stopped the page from turning, but
with rotation of 45 it failed.

Ok, maybe it's smart enough to know about 45 rotations.  So I tried this:

#!/bin/tcsh -f
#(ie run the tshell on this but don't read the .cshrc or .tcshrc)
echo version = 1.00 of fix 2007 Nov 15
# 2007 Nov 15, 1.00: origin 
set rot = 25
set rot = 45
set rot1 = 44
set rot2 = 46
cat paper.ps |\
sed "s/-90 rotate/-$rot1 rotate -$rot2 rotate/" |\
sed "s/90 rotate/$rot1 rotate $rot2 rotate/" |\
sed "s/90 neg rotate/$rot1 neg rotate $rot2 neg rotate/" |\
cat > fixed.ps
ps2pdf fixed.ps
open fixed.pdf

That works!!  The page is NOT rotated, but the table is sideways!

Have you tried -dAutoRotatePages=/None (# in stead of = on

Make sure you have an easily accessible hook to

file:///usr/local/share/ghostscript/8.12/doc/Use.htm

for whatever ghostscript version you have.  The man page doesn't come 
near telling you what you can do with gs,
and the ps2pdf man page tells you only the bare essentials. 

The variety of things you can specify with -d is astonishing, and the 
man page would be endless if they were all discussed there.

The instructions about -dAutoRotatePages=/None turn out not to be in 
Use.htm, but in Ps2pdf.htm in the same directory.

Some day, when all the work's done, I should get around to reading at 
least half of the documentation there.

Dear all,

I want to produce a figure using Inkscape which has some text, and I would 
like that text to be as close to the text in the main paper.

What is the default font that is used when compiling a document?
Alternatively, is there a "standard" font for figures?

TIA,

Computer Modern.

 > Alternatively, is there a "standard" font for figures?

In my opinion it is wrong to use a different font in figures.  I
assume that Inkscape uses system fonts like Times or Palatino, which
are ubiquitous.  They are supported by TeX, too.

If you like Palatino, for instance, and you are using LaTeX, try

\usepackage{mathpazo}
\usepackage{tgpagella}   

in this order.  mathpazo is needed for math support and tgpagella
provides glyphs for almost all Latin languages.

Regards,
  Reinhard

We've used TeX for our books for years but have always printed 2-column
books. I'm being asked to write an output routine for a one-column layout
with mirrored margins. Can anyone point me to a tutorial or instructions or
something for this that is fairly easy to understand? (I've used TeX for
over 10 years, but am actually a newbie to output routine writing.) Thank
you!

What I do is centering the main text on the page like

\pdfpagewidth=148.5mm
\pdfpageheight=210mm
\pdfhorigin=20.75mm
\pdfvorigin=18mm
\hsize=107mm
\vsize=173mm


and then put this centered box to the binding side of the pages by
variering \hoffset in the output routine:

\def\onepageout{\ifodd\pageno\hoffset=2mm\else\hoffset=-2mm\fi
  \shipout\vbox{\makeheadline
  \pagebody
  \makefootline}
\advancepageno
\ifnum\outputpenalty>-20000 \else\dosupereject\fi}

I hope this helps.

Kind regards,
Marcel Korpel

Thanks very much Reinhard, I will certainly try your suggestion, as soon as I 
figure out how to install the tgpagella package (I'm using Linux, Kubuntu 
Gutsy distribution)

Does anyone knows if there is a TeX package management under Linux, similar to 
the one provided by MikTex on Windows?

Cheers,
Adrian

You could try to omit \usepackage{tgpagella} if it doesn't exist on
your system.  It is not unlikely that Romanian accented characters are
supported by the default fonts.

Subject: [texhax] xdvi-motif.bin build problems
Message-ID: <23856343.1195175423338.JavaMail.root@web40>

Early this year I installed TexLive 2007. I didn't like the
xdvi-xaw.bin appearance so I pasted into the Tex tree a
xdvi-motif.bin that I found in my Slackware tetex package.
All has worked fine! It's a v22.84.9.

Recently I saw a much newer xdvik on CTAN. So I downloaded
v22.84.13. It configured, but 'blew up' on make. It said
that /usr/include/stdint.h had a duplicate unsigned def.

So I gave up and tried v22.84.12. It built without errors
and I copied xdvi-motif.bin and the xdvi shell wrapper
into my bin dir. A test of a complex Latex doc seemed
to indicate all was just perfect. I really liked the
new 3D buttons. But, when a print was ordered, either
by key or mouse, the ap 'crashed'. Here's the error message
left on stdout.

   xdvi-motif.bin 22.84.12 (Motif toolkit): events.c:4222:
   Shouldn't happen: Segmentation fault
        - trying to clean up and aborting ...

I tried moving in new config files, running texhash, applied
the patches, etc to no avail. I did NOT attempt to replace
the kpathsea-type binaries, however.

So I'm back to my old version. What am I doing wrong?

By the way, it would be nice if you added a xdvi-motif.bin
when you release TexLive 2008.

Here's my configure options

./configure --prefix=/usr/share/tex \
	--datadir=/usr/share/tex \
	--disable-a4 \
	--without-texinfo \
	--without-cjkutils \
	--without-musixflx \
	--with-ps=gs \
	--with-system-t1lib &> configureLog

Thanks for the assistance. You may forward this email as you
see fit.

It depends on what you want to do. Installing a ttf font for use 
with pdflatex is pretty easy if you are only interested in text 
fonts. If you want math support it becomes more involved.

There is a gui for installing ttf fonts in a MiKTeX setup:
<http://mtfi.sourceforge.net/>.

If you prefer to do it manually you can use this guide
<http://www.radamir.com/tex/ttf-tex.htm>

For the fonts coming with Windows most of the work is already done:
<http://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/winfonts/>.

For an overview of what is available in you installation check 
out the LaTeX Font Catalogue
<http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/>.

If you want to use TrueType fonts with the latex -> dvips -> 
ps2pdf route you need to do more work.

Subject: [texhax] Hyphenation in tabular environments
Message-ID: <473D5A55.10902@caltech.edu>

Hi all,

I can't seem to find a solution for my problem, after a fair amount of 
searching around:

I'm trying to get reasonable (if not necessarily perfect) hyphenation in 
tabular environments in LaTeX2e. Currently, for long words in thin 
columns, I only get hyphenation if I explicitly indicate hyphenation 
locations with \-

As a sample:
-----------------------------
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
\tolerance=10000 % Has no effect
\setlength{\parskip}{2em} %For readability of example
\begin{tabular}{|p{48pt}|p{48pt}|p{48pt}|}
   Nevertheless &  Nevertheless &  Nevertheless
\end{tabular}

Nevertheless Nevertheless Nevertheless Nevertheless Nevertheless 
Nevertheless Nevertheless

  \begin{tabular}{|p{48pt}|p{48pt}|p{48pt}|}
   Neverthe\-less &  Nevertheless &  Nevertheless
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
------------------------------

The first tabular has no hyphenation, and all the "Nevertheless"'s are 
overfull boxes on one line. However, the hyphenation rules are correct 
in general, as they are used by LaTeX in the paragraph after the first 
tabular. And indeed, when I many put \- in place, as in the second 
tabular, LaTeX does use the hyphenation point to split the word over two 
lines.

So my question is: how do I get LaTeX to use the "normal" hyphenation 
rules? It tried the line "\tolerance=10000" above, in various ways, but 
it has no effect. I may well be using it incorrectly.

Any suggestions greatly welcome! Also, I don't mind somewhat overfull 
boxes, but I'd like some way to get LaTeX to at least TRY.

Thanks,
Paul Cook

TeX doesn't hypenate the first work in a paragraph (and a tabular cell
is a paragraph).
Try inserting \hbox{}. And have a look at the ragged2e package.

Unless there is something in that page that I'm missing, that's pretty 
much different from MikTex's package management. It's true that texlive 
can be easily installed in Debian (and for testing, one can use Debian's 
repositories), and get a very complet set of packages. But this is not 
like MikTex, where one can install individual packages.

"\hbox{}Nevertheless" does not work. TeX will consider hyphenation at  
non-math glue so the usual solution is "\hspace{0pt}Nevertheless".

Hi,

please find the attached test case of a scrreprt/report, which uses
twoside to optimise the document for doublesided printing. Without
any further options, this creates a document which has a larger
*outer* margin than inner margin. I assume this is some sort of
binding correction, but it's on the wrong side! It should be left on
odd and right on even pages, but it's exactly the other way around.
Here is the PDF: http://scratch.madduck.net/report.pdf

How can I fix this?

Your assumption is wrong.

The inner margins are smaller than the outer margins because when you
combine those pages to form a book, then the two inner margins combine to
one white area optically, and for asthetic considerations of margin widths
you have to deal with the book, not the single pages.

> How can I fix this?

For example using the geometry package.

Hope that helps,

It should not!  Learn about page construction.

I know of two generic approaches, which I've run across in discussions
about how to play movies within pdflatex-generated presentations. They
should work for anything else you can run or launch, I guess.

Here are some README notes I wrote for myself. If you substitute a
script to launch your applet for movie_script.sh below, it should work I
think. But since the script is run outside the pdf itself, it (a) isn't
embedded in the pdf, (b) isn't portable and (c) is operating-system
dependent.

The 1st is to use the hyperref package:

In your latex source there is, for example:

\href{run:movie_script.sh}{Click Here}

movie_script.sh is just a shell script to run your favorite player, e.g.
a file with the one line:

mplayer -geometry 50%:50% -nofs  /home/sjs/movies/mymovie.mpg

(xine also works pretty well; you need something with a good command
line interface and which gives you control, e.g., to hide the controls,
etc.).

Then you need:

In ~/.mailcap:
application/x-sh; /bin/sh %s

to invoke sh to run your shell script. You can also use /bin/bash or
some
other shell interpreter. You also need to associate the .sh
ending with a shellscript:

In ~/.mime.types:
application/x-sh sh

There are ways to avoid opening your mime-types up to running a shell
script (which is a security risk) or you could teach your mailcap about
running videos (but then you lose control over options passed to the
player for specific ones); let me know if you want these notes.

The 2nd is to use pdf capabilities. I'll confess I've never got this to
work properly, but maybe it is closer to what you want. [I didn't try
very hard because the hpyerref solution has always been adequate for my
needs, but it would be nice to get something to auto-launch without a
click when you open the page.] It still uses an external script, say
videoscript.sh, that you write to do what you want (and hence still
suffers from (a)-(c) above). The following is copied from a posting I
received from someone else. I'd be interested to know if you get it to
work.

Define the following two new commands in pdflatex,

\newcommand{\pdflaunch}[1] {\pdfpageattr{/AA << /O << /S /Launch /F (#1)
>>>>}}
\newcommand{\pdflaunchlink}[2]{%
      \pdfannotlink attr{/Border [0 0 0]} user{/Subtype /Link /A << %
        /S /Launch /F (#1) >>}%
      \pdfliteral{0 1 0 0 k}%
      {#2}\pdfliteral{0 0 0 1 k}\pdfendlink%
      }

you have either the possibility to launch this script instantly with a
new slide:

\pdflaunch{videoscript.sh}

or after pressing a special link defined by:

\pdflaunchlink{videoscript.sh}{Start video}

Don't forget to kill the video application when it is not needed
anymore. For this purpose again define a little script e.g.:

killall mpeg_play

and call it as mentioned above.

And I don't know what Tim really wants to achieve. :-)

attachfile2 will only embed a file as file into a pdf.

I can't imagine any way that \hbox{} could ever help.

Starting paragraphs with \hspace*{0pt}\ignorespaces would work.

The approach Martin is suggesting is essentially how 
I generated the Sable example that I recently posted, and 
it can be used to spawn pretty much any filetype, modulo
Adobe's Technical Note:

   http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=331371

Here, for example is a PDF that spawns a Jar file:

With memoir class option, in tabular environment,
\begin{tabular}c @{\hspace{3pt}} c}
works fine giving 3pt intercolumn space.
But if I abbreviate @{\hspace{3pt}} using 
\newcommand{\HS}{@{\hspace{3pt}}}
and use
\begin{tabular}{c \HK c}
it does not compile and gives the  followingerror message:
Class memoir Error -- Illegal pream-token {\HS}:  `c' used.

This problem does not occur in `article class', where everything
works fine.  So, how can I make the above `\renewcommad' 
work inside Tabular when using Memoir Class?

That's exactly how we all learn the command line.

Right.  It turns out that a number of unix commands have this effect
of having trouble with a dash because that's used as a flag indicator.
So people added a feature to get around it.  Try this:

grep -- '-90 rotate' paper.ps

The '--' tells grep to ignore the '-' later on.

Also you could have used

grep '90 rotate' paper.ps

and that would show all cases.

Apparently it's controllable in ps2pdf - note the other people pointed
out this flag:

But I agree - one should not have to turn this silly "smart" feature

    Is there are way that TeX can be used (via a CD or something) on
    a computer on which TeX is not installed?

Others already suggested running TeX as part of a standalone GNU/Linux
distribution such as Knoppix.

Unfortunately, I don't know of any CD/DVD on which TeX can be run with
zero config files on local disk.  TeX Live requires this, and I suspect
MiKTeX does too, although I don't know that for a fact.

It would be feasible, though not exactly trivial, to make a 100% live
DVD, but so far no one (to my knowledge) has done it, sorry to say.

There have been some presentations of Linux distributions for TeX at
BachoTeX, e.g. LiTeX in 2006
(http://www-stary.gust.org.pl/BachoTeX/2006/abstracts/39en.html)., but
IIRC they are mainly aimed at polish users.

do it as a \newcolumntype instead

then

It is possible to create a portable MiKTeX installation on external
writable devices such as USB memory sticks or disks that runs without
installation, see

Hello!

I'm a retired typesetter. Use to work on a QuadX system which use a lanquage call TEXT PROGRAMMING. We were able to create various programs. One was an underscoring program. We could very easily insert the following specs: 1) Rule weight; 2) baseline shift 3) and kerning around all of the descenders (y, g, p, etc.). In other words, we could tuck the underscores around the descenders for a perfect look. We would be able to create very precise and pleasing effects. Also, the same in creating fractions. We could also put a FORMAT like: {F23} in front of a block of text. And, have it look for a delimeter like:?
  Format 23 would then suck up all the text up to that delimeter and process it according to what we had programmed in F23, etc. Can TeX do such feats? Please let me know.

Thank you in advance!

Ira

Dear All,

I have the following two snippets of LaTeX code (automatically
generated by getting two different versions of a plotting program to
produce the same graph.) In case anyone wonders what \ut is,
\newcommand{\ut}[1]{\,\mathrm{#1}}.

Snippet 1:

\put(200,2458){%
\special{ps: gsave currentpoint currentpoint translate
270 rotate neg exch neg exch translate}%
\makebox(0,0)[b]{\shortstack{Dissolution\\{}rate
$\Lambda{}/(\ut{nm}/\ut{s})$}}%
\special{ps: currentpoint grestore moveto}%
}%

Snippet 2:

   \put(200,2458){%
   \special{ps: gsave currentpoint currentpoint translate
270 rotate neg exch neg exch translate}%
   \makebox(0,0){\strut{}Dissolution\\{}rate
   $\Lambda{}/(\ut{nm}/\ut{s})$}%
   \special{ps: currentpoint grestore moveto}%
   }%

In the first, the line break "\\{}" is respected, while in the second,
it's ignored.  Does anyone know why, please?

All,

The code below compiles fine in a paper I have, but when I try and put it in
a beamer presentation I receive the error that "ps" is unknown file format.

\begin{figure}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

}

I tried playing around w/ the included packages but didn't have any luck.
The packages of the paper are:

\documentclass[11pt, letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage{latexsym,setspace,lscape}
\usepackage[dvipdfm]{graphicx}
\usepackage[]{natbib}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[active]{srcltx}

The packages of the beamer presentation are:

\documentclass[11pt]{beamer}
\usepackage{times} 
\usepackage{graphicx,color}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{mathptmx}
\usepackage{helvet}


In the beamer presentation I've also included a pdf figure successfully.  Is
it that one cannot include both pdf and ps files in the same document?

Hello Ira,

The short answer is that EVERYTHING is possible in TeX; it kind of  
just depends on how hard you want to work.

Your second question first: macro expansion is a big part of TeX, so  
you can definite use a string that indicates the name of a macro and  
tell it how much of the token stream to absorb for its argument.  The  
most common way to do this is

	\def\Fxxiii#1{formatting of the argument here}

Then you would call it by \Fxxiii{my text}.

If you wanted a custom delimiter you can do it by instead defining

	\def\Fxxiii#1){formatting of the argument here}

and then call it by \Fxxiii my text).

Braces are kind of special for TeX, and TeX expects non-numeric  
characters in control sequence (macro) names.  But you *can* coax it  
to accept the very syntax you want.

As for the first question, there are some underlining packages  
available.  The \ul macro underlines text, but doesn't adjust for  
descenders (it's just as high as possible below the text without  
overlapping any possible descenders).  The ulem package provides a  
\uline macro that makes sure the underlines are the same height  
throughout.  But that doesn't do what you want, it just makes all the  
underlines below the descent, regardless of whether a descender is  
present.  The soul package puts the underlining right below the  
baseline regardless of descenders, so it overlaps.  Also not what you  
want.

I'm pretty sure what you want is possible, but I don't know if it's  
been implemented.  I think nowadays people would just use a different  
font shape (e.g., italic) rather than underline.

I found a lot of this discussion on the web:

https://mail.cs.drexel.edu/pipermail/unix-dev/2004-February/000647.html

Take care,
Matt

I have a (nasty) feeling that what Ira wants
to achieve is beyond TeX in its basic form.
If I understand Ira correctly, then at


>> we could tuck the underscores around the descenders for a  
>> perfect look. 

what is being discussed is an /interruption/ to the
underlining to stop it just short of a descender, and
to resume it just afterwards.  If this is the case
(am I right, Ira), this would require information
on the /positioning/ of the descender, which TeX lacks.

Actually, this would be pretty easy problem to solve (at least
conceptually) if one is willing to invest the (perhaps considerable) 
time in constructing a high-quality virtual font. A similar comment 
could be made about overlining to avoid the problem of overlines be 
either of fixed width or the width of the bounding box.

Cheers,
Michael

The simple answer is that you can't use MikTeX with MS Word.  Nor would
you want to.  Once you learn how to use LaTeX, I think you will never

I'm not up on virtual fonts, but I think it would be easier than that.
The below is kind of clunky, and someone else can maybe turn it into an
actually usable macro, but something like it might satisfy the original
poster's desire.

Hi,
I agree with Phil, but there are a few things which currently can be
done, though.  None of them is really beautiful.

 1. If you know in advance that you always have a white background and
    you draw the line before the text is typeset, you can insert
    PostScript or PDF code into virtual fonts which puts white
    rectangles under the descenders which then hide particular parts
    of the line.  In this case you have full control about the
    thickness and position of the line from within TeX, but it doesn't
    do what you want if the background is not white.

 2. The other approach is to make a virtual font which provides line
    segments for each glyph.  The line is then part of the glyph and
    can contain interruptions.  However, in this case the position and
    thickness of the line cannot be changed.

But maybe there is a quite reasonable solution: We'll have LuaTeX
soon, which makes TeX's internal data structures accessible.  If you
follow the second approach, I suppose that it's possible to control
underline position and thickness by a (Lua)TeX macro, and probably
even the horizontal distances between the line fragments and the
descenders.

Ira, TeX is a very powerful typesetting program and even if you are
very familiar with another program, it's worthwhile to explore TeX.

TeX comes (at least) in three incarnations:

 1. plain TeX.  A macro package provided by Don Knuth, good for people
    who want to know how things work.  Everything is described in "The
    texbook", which is the ultimate reference.

 2. LaTeX.  A macro package written by Lesly Lamport.  Modular
    approach.  You just include a macro package and pass some
    arguments to it if you want to change the layout.

 3. Context.  A macro package written by Hans Hagen, based on plain
    TeX.  This is by far the most advanced incarnation of TeX.

If you are completely new to TeX and want to have fine control about
the layout, I strongly recommend to look into Context.

Your mail header tells me that you are on Windows.  If you want to
install TeX, download it from:

  http://www.fsci.fuk.kindai.ac.jp/kakuto/win32-ptex/web2c75-e.html

W32TeX is a TeX distribution which provides everything Japanese need,
but it's the only one I'm aware of which provides a beta version of
LuaTeX at the moment.

If you have any questions about LuaTeX, please join the pdfTeX mailing
list.

LuaTeX is also part of the context standalone distributed by pragma-ade. 
That is the easiest way of working with context on windows. You also get a 
luatex enabled context. See 
http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Windows_Installation for more details about 
installing context on windows.

I think so ---but you can use eps and pdf files in the same document.  
First, chances are you have a command line program ps2eps, which  
converts your ps files to eps, calculating the right bounding box, so  
you don't have to do it manually; then

\documentclass{beamer}
%\usepackage{times}         % No need for this if you use mathptmx.
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{mathptmx}       % But does this work with beamer?
\usepackage{helvet}
\usepackage{graphicx}       % I don't think color.sty is needed.
\usepackage{epstopdf}       % <- This converts your eps files;
                             % shell-escape is necessary.

To include pdf files in LaTeX you have to typeset with pdflatex,  
which you are obviously doing; and to include eps graphics in a  
pdflatex document you need the epstopdf package.

There is a beamer users mailing list:

https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/latex-beamer-users

Best,

Axel

I don't think that this will help with descenders, where you want only
some parts of the line. Most likely you will only be able to have a
line or no line, due to the box model of TeX (no information about the
shape of the glyphs).

Or Hans will eventually implement a solution in lua which uses the
real outlines from the fonts... :-))

Some Frenchman created such a thing, based on the howto. He even included
his favorite La(TeX) aware text editor. (Which I didn't, because mine
is Vim and I didn't want to frighten people off ;-) ) It is called USBTeX:

Unfortunately the website is in French. Maybe the author could be convinced to

I had virtual fonts in mind.  Of course, these line fragments have to
be created manually for each glyph and inserted as PS or PDF specials.
The information is then in the VF.  If the vertical position and the
thickness of the line has to be changed, I suppose that LuaTeX could
do that.

Really?  This is not easy.  Will he implement PS commands like
charpath, pathforall, pathbbox... in Lua?  That would be very nice
because it allows people to determine the shape of initials and set
\parshape automatically...

  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] a new LaTeX package for documenting TeX (not only LaTeX)
	sources.
Message-ID: <47434207.1050304@o2.pl>

Recently I put on CTAN the gmdoc LaTeX package that serves for 
documenting (La)TeX sources. (macros/latex/contrib/gmdoc)

gmdoc is compatible with the `traditional' doc package in a sense that
it typesets the .dtx files written for doc.

But more than that, gmdoc allows to write and document a source with 
almost no markup: the commentary marked only with % is sufficient for 
gmdoc to typeset it in Roman and the rest verbatim in typewriter---no 
special environments are required. (Therefore it may be useful to 
document also non-LaTeX sources.)

gmdoc makes use of hyperref advantages, e.g. all the index entries are 
hyperlinks.

The gmdoc bundle works with XeTeX so you may typeset documentation in 
your favourite system fonts.

As doc, gmdoc scans all the control sequences appearing in the code 
layer and indexes them (if they are not excluded from indexing). Moreover,
gmdoc automatically detects a handful of defining commands, such as 
\def, \new..., LaTeX \newcommand, \newenvironment, \DeclareOption, 
xkeyval \define at key etc., and kvoptions \Declare...Option, and indexes 
their arguments (not only control sequences) specially, as defined at 
that point.
Moreover, gmdoc allows to declare your own defining commands to be 
automatically detected.

Therefore I think gmdoc is worth switching to and I kindly ask you to 
try it and give me some feedback.

Grzegorz Murzynowski.

I don't know if Hans has even thought of that, but with Hans nothing

	article class
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0711200138300.7807@csopt4.wpi.edu>


I write many homework assignments for my students that I post twice, The 
second time with solutions; each problem is followed by its solution.

Naturally I want to use the same file for the two postings. My current 
method: surround the solutions by \begin{comment}...\end{comment} and use 
a parameter that gets a value 0 (no solutions) or 1 (with solutions), 
When it is 1 an \ifthenelse kicks in that activates a \renewenvironment, 
which replaces the comment delimiters by a text like "solution:"

Thus when I need to post solutions, the only editing is to change one 
\newcommand argument from 0 to 1. This works well, but I "lose" the 
normal use of the comment environment, which I would like to keep.

The same parameter is also used to drive changes in headers and markings, 
so I would like to keep using it.  I thought of a new environment, say 
solution, in which to keep the solutions, and then skip them when my 
parameter is 0, but I cannot do it with the comment environment (the 
\end{solution} is not caught..). there is certainly an obvious solution 
that evades me.

Any suggestions?

Thank you,                        --Micha Hofri

See the documentation for the comment package. You can achieve what
you currently have in an easier way with \includecomment and
\excludecomment.

That's the ticket.  I once had a sign that said RTFM.  Time for another?

Or you can give a try to some of the packages written for exams or

By default the underline is placed below the typical descenders.

\shortstack is a good way to get multiple lines compactly.

Also tabular.

No, \makebox puts its argument in "lr" mode, not "paragraph" mode,
so it only has a single line.  You can use a \parbox for paragraph
mode, and multiple lines.

Ah, thank you.  You've given me the clue I needed with your
description of what \shortstack does.  As I mentioned, these bits of
LaTeX code are automatically generated, so I can edit
straightforwardly only the bit that says

Dissolution\\{}rate
$\Lambda{}/(\ut{nm}/\ut{s})$

The problem is solved by manually putting back in the \shortstack,
getting

\makebox(0,0){\strut{}\shortstack{Dissolution\\{}rate
$\Lambda{}/(\ut{nm}/\ut{s})$}}%

Hello Sir,

 

I'm trying to import a picture that I've drawn using MATLAB or Excel  into a
latex document. I tried using the following commands but they don't seem to
work.

 

\begin{figure}[h]

\centering

\scalebox{0.5}

{includegraphics{w12_1.eps}}

\end{figure}

 

This is the error message that I'm getting: "Cannot determine  the size of
graphic in w12_1.eps (no Bounding box)"

 

This probably means that I have to define the graphic's dimensions somehow.
I haven't been able to figure out how to do this. If you have any idea,
could you please help me out.

 

Thanks a lot.

 

Regards

David

Perhaps you already have a command line program called eps2eps,  
which, I think, can correct the bounding box. Also, I think is better

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{w12_1.eps}
\end{figure}

Note that specifying just one placement should only be used in special 
cases, otherwise LaTeX might run out of options and the figure will end up 
at the end of the chapter/document.

How large are the figure?

This is because there are some settings that says how large a figure can 
be if it is to be placed at the various places.

There is a general  explanation in the memoir manual.

Subject: [texhax] bst files
Message-ID: <1195669833.474479498eb04@panthermail.uwm.edu>

To whom it may concern:

I'm submitting a paper to a journal that has its own citation style and its own
style for bibliographies.

To conform to its citation style, I downloaded and ran natbib.  I include
plainnat as my bibliographystyle.  This works fine.

To conform to the style for the bibliography, I downloaded merlin.mbs and then
ran makebst as instructed.  This produced a file that I named lastfirst.bst,
but LaTeX doesn't see it.

There are a couple of questions here.  First, where should lastfirst.bst be
stored?  merlin gives no information about where to store either merlin.mbs or
makebst.tex, so I stored it in a directory Program Files/merlin that I created.
 I also copied the resulting file lastfirst.bst to the natbib directory, since
LaTeX found natbib (and plainnat.bst) with no problem.  Nothing worked.

Second, it appears that I will need two style files, plainnat (for citation
style) and lastfirst (for bibliography style), but it doesn't look like the
\bibliographystyle command allows for two arguments.  Does it?  If not, how do
I accomplish both of my goals?

I would greatly appreciate help with the above questions.

Sincerely,
Jay Beder

Subject: [texhax] Simple graph theory diagrams in a document
Message-ID: <47448753.6000402@psych.uib.no>

Colleagues:

Almost exactly a month ago, there were a question about drawing in a 
LatTex document.  I knew I would need a solution to that kind of 
problem, but not just right then.  So, I made a note, and left the 
problem for the time being.  Today, I looked at what I assumed was the 
outcome of the recomendations: pgf/tikz.

Dear me, a 248-page manual in color.  A very powerful tool. 
Obviously.  And very obviously a blatant overkill in my case.

I am writing a text within psychology there I employ basic stuff in 
graph theory.  The primary tool is what is called "signed and directed 
graphs", consisting of a set of points ("dots" on the paper) and a set 
of relations between them in the form of arrows (dashed for negative 
and solid for positive, which may be curved if there are arrows in 
both directions between two points).

So I need to draw something like that in the MS, only consisting of 
very few points, maximum of say five.  Possibly with some kind of 
label (x1, x2 etc.) on the points, and possibly with some value (-2 to 
+2) associated with the relations or arrows.

In other words, what I need is something that is "good enough", less 
of an overkill, but still producing nice diagrams.

Any suggestions?

Tom

you can produce these e. g. with the program "dot". Uses text input,
makes automatic placement and routing, output .eps, see

There is also a converter that converts Graphviz to TikZ.

Xfig and Dia are two tools I find useful for this. Both export eps and raw ps.

The easiest solution is to simply put it in the same directory as your
.tex file. That would work. If you put it somewhere else (such as in the
directory where plainnat.bst is stored), you will probably have to
update the file database. On linux this is done with "mktexlsr"; you
appear to be using Windows, however -- I'm not sure how it's done there.
But if you put it in the same directory as the .tex file, this step is
not necessary.

It is my understanding that the bibtex style file dictates both the
citation style and the bibliographystyle. I would assume that if the
journal provide a bibtex style file, it will dictate both and you will
only need the journal's style file.

These should work anyway - assuming lastfirst.bst respects natbib (as it
should).

But you also need to refresh the filename database (use the MiKTeX settings
wizard).

That did work.  Evidently lastfirst.bst respects natbib, as was pointed out to
me by Philip Ratcliffe.  Thanks very much (to both of you).

Yes, but "easiest" is not always the same as "best".

If there's any chance you'll need the same files again for another
submission, then you're much better off with the "proper" solution of a
localtexmf directory system - the refresshing is really no big deal - and
the general LaTeX principles are respected.  Also, once you adopt this
strategy, you'll find life easier since upgrades and moving/renaimng folders
etc. will not undo what you've done.

Not quite right, the BibTeX style file only dictates how the actually
bibliography entry is printed out.  The citation format is (obviously?)
dictated by something that LaTeX reads, i.e. a "normal" style file (.sty).
In this case it is natbib that will presumably do the work but many  journal
.sty files also make changes in this respect. 

What the natbib (and other) .bst files do is put enough information into the
\bibitem optional argument so that the LaTeX .sty file can then create the
required citation output.

Cheers,  Phil

In fact, it is often necessary to hand edit M$ postscript files to remove
unwanted head and tail lines containing control characters for printers that
upset the LaTeXed versions (i.e. Yap chokes).  One can then also easily edit
the Bounding Box line by hand to adjust it exactly as one pleases.  If, at
the same time, you have it opened in ghostview (with the option "Show
bounding box" checked), then you can immediately see the effect of any
changes made - and thus undo them if necessary ;-)

I agree with you in principle; however, in this particular case, I
disagree :) For any general packages, yes, put it in a local texmf
directory. *But*, for journal or conference proceedings specific
packages, I always put the files in the same directory as the rest of
the paper. You won't be needing that package for anything else except
perhaps future submissions to the same journal or conference, and
chances are they'll have made minor changes -- so you must use a newer
version anyhow. Globally installing a package that is specific to
exactly one paper seems wrong :)

To add to the list of possibilities, I use the drawing side of open
office for this kind of thing, export as a pdf, and use pdfcrop to crop
the figure (i.e., remove the full page of white space). Exporting as eps
or bitmap also works. Openoffice draw has connectors and nodes of
various styles (straight, curved, ...).

For more involved diagrams I use scribus, which is more of a dtp
programme but with a lot of drawing capabilities, as it generates really
nice pdf (and ps) exports.

Both are open source and multi-platform.

Using | File | Save as | eps | used to work well in Matlab in Windows.
 Exporting Excel files as eps (?) may lead to problems.  If I had to I
would install a postscript printer and generate a postscript file by
printing to file using the postscript driver.  I would the use
ghostsctipt (GSview) to convert postscript to eps.

Hi Phil,
regarding M$ postscript files I completely agree with you.  On the
other hand it's amazing 

But as far as I can see, ps2eps removes things which are undesirable
in eps files and re-calculates the BoundingBox itself.

This is the reason I mentioned it.  I have the impression that the
author (Roland Bless) had Windows PostScript printer drivers in mind
when he wrote this program.  It does a really good job in this
respect.  I don't know whether it works perfectly in all situations
but it's worth a try.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Hi Lars,

 

Re your question about it being an environment - I'm afraid that I am not
sure!

 I have a main page of code that brings multiple docos together and I 

initially copied it from a working example. The context of the code 

where it hangs up is where I include the various components... 

 

\frontmatter %order of chapters as required 

\include{titlepage}\blanknonumber 

\include{declaration}\blanknonumber

\include{acknowledgements}\blanknonumber

\include{abstract}\blanknonumber

\include{tableofcontents}\blanknonumber

\include{listoftables}\blanknonumber

\include{listoffigures}\blanknonumber

\mainmatter

\include{chapter1}

\include{chapter2}

 

The Table of Contents doco is quite simple with just ....

 

\begin{tableofcontents}

\begin{center}

\end{center}

\end{tableofcontents}

 

Does this help? Sorry I didn't provide more details initially.

 

Cheers, Bruce Thomson

Hi all,

I initially posted a question yesterday and received a response but it
didn't appear to circulate in the texhax group, so I have copied and pasted
it here to continue the discussion, this time fully subscribed in texhax! 

********************

I have a problem which has already received some previous attention. However
I have looked at the various posts and tried a range of remedies, but none
appear to work. I was wondering if someone might be able to interpret some
of the finer detail in this message to suggest a fix. It occurs in MiKTeX
2.6 when compiling and never occurred when using previous versions! The
problem occurs when it reaches the tableofcontents. I have checked brackets
and variously edited out each package that I use, rewritten some files and
all to no avail. 

! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [input stack size=5000].

I have also noticed in previous threads that a copy of the source code is of
use, so here it is. 

Any help would be gratefully appreciated.

OMG. Do you know what you are doing? You load the same package twice
(geometry), load two packages that do the same thing (graphics/graphicx)
and probably load lots of packages you don't need.

PLEASE read some LaTeX documentation and weed out your preamble!

I'm curious: What makes you think this is correct?

Replace these lines with \tableofcontents and please read some
documentation on LaTeX (the FAQ has links).

Hi,

Is there a way to avoid the parindent at the start of a new page? At the
moment, I do this manually by inserting a \noindent before each
paragraph that starts a new page, but obviously this is extremely
fragile---I'd much prefer an automatic solution. 

Thanks!

AFAIK not. If you do this, how should a reader recognise the start of
a paragraph at the top of a page?

Hey,

No, that removes the paragraph indentation *everywhere* in the document.
I just want it gone at the start of each new page. So the normal layout
for paragraphs should be

    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

*Unless* the second paragraph happens to start a new page, in which case
the paragraph indentation is useless and looks silly:

    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
---- page break ----
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

It's not useless. How will the reader know that a new paragraph is 
started? Especially if the previous one ends at the end of the line, 
just like your drawing.

Hmmm. I guess that's a fair point. I just think it looks little 
awkward, especially when the paragraph is very short, for example if the
entire paragraph is something like 

  Consider the following example:

A page break itself provides a visual break between two paragraphs, and
I try to avoid splitting paragraphs across page breaks. That doesn't
always work, of course, and if the paragraph is long enough then that's
ok--chances are though that the continuation of the paragraph on the
next page will not start a new sentence. If it does, it is somewhat
ambiguous anyway; a reader might mistake it for the start of a new
paragraph since it starts a new page.

Hi,

You got lots of responses but I want to defend the TikZ option.

There's a very helpful group of users on the mailing list so you're  
not alone with the 248-page manual:

	https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pgf-users

If you're doing a lot of these diagrams, a solution within TeX is  
going to speed up your workflow a lot.  You can copy-and-paste code  
to make new diagrams from old diagrams.  If you decide to change  
styles, you can do it in one fell swoop.  And the language itself is  
very well suited to exactly the kind of diagrams you want to make.   
You can create and name "nodes" and draw arrows between them.

Thanks for the hint! I tried

  \usepackage{everypage}
  \AddEverypageHook{\noindent}

but that doesn't seem to work. Is that what you had in mind?

I am slightly surprised that people seem to think this is such a strange
request. Here's a small example from a printed book:

http://www.edsko.net/example.png

(sorry for the yellow highlighting, screenshot from Google books). The
indentation of the first line on that page just doesn't look right to me
-- am I the only one who feels that way?

Another convention is to avoid indentation and enlarge the vertical
space between paragraphs instead (\usepackage{parskip}).

Jan Tschichold, a famous Swiss typographer, explained in one of his
books why paragraphs should be indented:  Because, if a new paragraph
starts at the top of a page, without indentation this information is
lost.  Martin explained this already.

Though you could consider \usepackage{parskip}, I'm sure that for
scientific publications it's most important that the logical structure
of the document is clear.

 > -- am I the only one who feels that way?

I hope so.  Yes, it might look wrong at a first glance, but it isn't.

  Reinhard

Subject: [texhax] bibtex inbook: use both author and editor,

Message-ID: <47473008.9030002@binghamton.edu>

I used custom-bib to create a bibliographystyle I called
StandardMedicalJournal.  I may have unknowingly done something I didn't
want to do when I was going through all the questions on screen, because
my style won't print editor, author, book title, and chapter title for
an INBOOK reference.  Here is the reference in my bib file:


@INBOOK{Ryan2005,
  title = {Headache},
  publisher = {Elsevier-Health Sciences Division},
  year = {2005},
  editor = {RE Rakel and ET Bope},
  author = {CW Ryan},
  booktitle = {Conn's Current Therapy},
  edition = {57th edition}
}


Here is the reference I get, after running bibtex on my source file
(which is for my CV, using ModernCV.)

Ryan C.  Headache, Elsevier-Health Sciences Division. 57th edition
edition, 2005; .

with the word Headache italicized.  And yes, the word edition appears twice.

Below is the inbook entry in my .bst file.  Is there an easy way to fix
it so that editor, author, book title, and chapter title all appear?
And to get rid of the second appearance of "edition?"  Or would you
advise starting over and going through custom-bib to create a new .bst
file (I'm pretty happy with the rest of it.)

Thanks.

It circulated.  You probably have your preferences set so your own messages
don't go back to you.

That is closer, but it is *still* not enough for anybody to replicate your problem
and then solve it.

Leave out most of the packages!

Do not \include files you do not provide.

Shorten the bodsy as much as possible.

Hint: See what there is about a \label command that causes infinite
recursion.  Did you redefine \label?  More likely it is used in a wrong
place, or the tag includes bad characters.

I hope so too. I still keep a Christopher Creutzig's message to the

I think you might want @INCOLLECTION instead of @INBOOK.

You could try just putting edition={57th} in your bib file instead of
edition={57th edition}.

IF (big if) you wish to do this (after all that has been said in this  
thread) you should be aware that you have to intervene at special places.  
Using something like everypage does not work because it happens much too  
late: you want something to intervene in the paragraph breaking.

Your best bet for this is hijacking \everypar in combination with  
something storing the position on the page such as \pdfsavepos which  
exists in a more user-friendly incarnation in the zref package. So for  
each new paragraph begun with \everypar, set a position marker with zref.  
Then check the vertical position of the marker. If it falls on the top  
line of the page, remove the paragraph indentation.

Here is a small example:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[savepos]{zref}


\newcounter{par-position}

\newcommand*\checkandfixparindent{%
   \stepcounter{par-position}%	
   \message{\zposy{par-\number\value{par-position}}}%
   \ifnum\zposy{par-\number\value{par-position}} > 46500000\relax
   % the value depends on your layout - check with the messages written
     \begingroup\setbox0\lastbox\endgroup% remove indention box
   \fi
   \zsavepos{par-\number\value{par-position}}%
}


\makeatletter
\AtBeginDocument{\addto at hook\everypar{\checkandfixparindent}}
\makeatother

\setlength\textheight{5cm}


\begin{document}

\input{tufte}\par \input{tufte}\par \input{tufte}\par
\input{tufte}\par \input{tufte}\par \input{tufte}\par
\input{tufte}\par \input{tufte}\par \input{tufte}\par
\input{tufte}\par \input{tufte}\par \input{tufte}\par
\input{tufte}\par \input{tufte}\par \input{tufte}\par
\end{document}


Ensuring the \everypar addition survives throughout the document is left  
as an exercise...

And don't do it! :-)

You might have more luck convincing someone to work on this
(difficult) problem by providing evidence that it has been used
successfully in traditional typography, or any professional
typography, rather than showing a normally indented document 
that is well accepted.

I strongly agree that you should not do this.

Who are you writing for?  Do you really want everybody who reads your
paper to think that the material at the top of the page is a
continuation of the previous paragraph when it is not?

Actually, it's going to be much worse for the reader than my example

Message-ID: <20071124153407.GA2582@netsoc.tcd.ie>

Hi,

A final follow-up question in light of all the strong recommendations
not to do this. Suppose I wanted to avoid indenting the first paragraph
on a page only if it is a very small paragraph, such as

  Consider the following example:
   
    --- indented example ---

  Continuation..

instead of

    Consider the following example:
    
    -- indented example ---

  Continuation..

This is mainly why I wanted to avoid the indendation, because I think it
doesn't look right that the 'Consider..' is indented as much as the
example; it's ok when the paragraph is longer:

    Consider the blah blah blah blah blah blah
  blah blah blah following example:
    
    -- indented example --
 
  Continuation..

because now the example clearly stands out again. Can I in some way
manually call your 'checkandfixparindent' macro before the 'Consider the
following example' paragraph? (I tried calling it directly just before
the paragraph but that either has no effect or gives the following
error:

  ! You can't use `\lastbox' in vertical mode.

Using '\leavevmode\checkandfixparindent' doesn't work either (although
it gets rid of the error) -- I suspect that this is because the macro is
now somehow removing the wrong box or something like that, but I don't
know how to fix it. I also tried

\newcommand*\noindentatnewpage{%
   \stepcounter{par-position}%
   \message{\zposy{par-\number\value{par-position}}}%
   \ifnum\zposy{par-\number\value{par-position}} > 43500000\relax
   % the value depends on your layout - check with the messages written
     \noindent%
   \fi
   \zsavepos{par-\number\value{par-position}}%
}

where I modified your macro to use a \noindent if the condition it true
but that doesn't quite work either (it does something; it sometimes
removes the parindent, but not always..) but I have to admit that I
don't really understand what the rest of the macro does.

Thanks, your help is appreciated!

Your layout originality will not survive copyediting.  Unless you're  
self-publishing (or publishing at a place that doesn't really  
copyedit), you are merely creating more work for your copyeditor.   
(Well, not really, your copyeditor will probably just delete all the  
extra code messing with paragraphs and substitute the house style  
file...)  Either way, seems like a waste of effort (and a bad idea  
anyways).

There have been a number of replies to this /crie de coeur/,
and although Morten Hoegholm <morten.hoegholm at gmail.com>
came up with a viable (and illuminating) solution, by
far the majority of responses have been along the
lines of "just don't do it".  I would like to play devil's
advocate and defend Edsko's position.

Much of the criticism has asked "how is the reader to know
if he (or she) has just encountered a new paragraph when
encountering an indented leading-cap line at the top of
a new page ?".  But does this matter ?  Do we lose a great
deal if we fail to identify each and every paragraph visually ?
Should not the /content/ make it plain what is, and what
is not, a paragraph ?  Remember that a paragraph should
focus on a single idea : according to Wikipaedia (which
I rarely cite, but it seems pretty accurate in this case),
a paragraph "is a self-contained unit of discourse in
writing, dealing with a particular point or idea".  Should
it not therefore be plain to the reader that if the unindented
leading-cap sentence introduces a new idea, which is then
followed through until the paragraph ends, then it is almost
certainly the case that the sentence did indeed introduce
a new paragraph.  And if the reader is wrong, and mis-identifies
it as a continuation of the preceding para., will he or she
be so misled as to significantly reduce the effectiveness
of the prose ?  I argue not.

So let us be a little more open in our approach to
experimental typesetting : if Edsko wants unindented
paragraphs at the top of a new page, then let him
have them.  Advise him, if you will, that he is
ignoring convention; but please don't tell him he
is wrong : he is not, he is just "different".

The real question is not convention or not, but "does this help the  
reader?" I suspect the answer is that it does not, and it may well  
hinder the reader.

Hey,

I have been experimenting a bit with Morten's macro. It works as long as
the first line on a page is actually at the top of the page; but if that
isn't the case (for example, if there is a figure) it breaks. I have
been trying various variations on his theme; in case anyone is
interested (now why do I get the feeling that there won't be? :-)), the
following seems to work even when there are figures: 

\newlength{\LastPageGoal}

\makeatletter
\AtBeginDocument{\addto at hook\everypar{%
  \ifthenelse{\lengthtest{\pagetotal>\LastPageGoal}}%
    {\setbox0=\lastbox}%
    {}%
  \setlength{\LastPageGoal}{\pagegoal}%
  \addtolength{\LastPageGoal}{-1.01em}%
}}
\makeatother

The macro basically checks if the paragraph starts after the maximum
height of the page (minus 1.01em), which will mean that it will be moved
to the next page (and will thus be the first paragraph on that page).
This works quite well, even in the presence of figures (which reduce
\pagegoal).

I think this will only break in case of a widow, but I cannot think of
a way to fix that. If anyone has any ideas, I'd love to hear them :)

Hello again,

I have an almost finished thesis that I would like to give my supervisor for 
review. The trouble is the size of the default font in LaTeX is rather small 
for his taste, he would like me to increase it.

I searched the web after font size, but everything I found was related to the 
LaTeX commands like \Large or \Huge, but I don't want to use larger fonts in 
*some* places but to increase the font size for the whole document.

Actually I would rather not change the font size per se, because that would 
break the current paging arrangement. Instead, I would very much like to know 
if there's any possibility to increase *everything* on every page like in 
zooming. On a A4 paper there is a lot of unnecessary space around the text, I 
wonder if I could use that space zooming the text in order to preserve the 
current number of pages.

I hope my question is clear, thank you in advance for any hint,
Adrian

If you are printing through dvips, you can reset the magnification with 
the -x <num> option.  Look at the
manual for the details.    I don't know what LaTeX may have done with 
the \mag primitive, but you could
experiment with that (see the TeXbook).  Judiciously used, it will 
probably give you uniform magnification for every dimension in the dvi 
file, and it should leave line and page breaks alone.   If it doesn't, 
then resetting -x in dvips certainly will. 

The CUPS popup menu for my Hewlett Packard PCL printers allows global 
magnification also.  Make a pdf, and print through a pdf reader.  (If 
you do scale your output in this way, remember to turn off the scaling 
in the next run.)

Adrian:

If there is a lot of unnecessary white space on your pages, you might do
best taking care of a problem like this after the LaTeX stage.  For
example, I believe pstops (part of psutils) can be made to do what you
want, if you're going the PS route and so can some of the printing
options in Adobe Acrobat, if you're in the straight-to-PDF camp.

Yes: a logical paragraph is neither more nor less than a unit of text that should be clearly and consistently distinguished by the design.  It 'should be' used
to contain a single idea if one follows the rules of good writing style as in Wikipedia but it is not defined by the idea; if it were then any text in which more than one idea is intertwined within sentences would have paragraphs that do not consist of complete sentences; whilst such text may be bad style, it is grammatically correct and still needs splitting into paragraphs.

> Should not the /content/ make it plain what is, and what
> is not, a paragraph ?  

Definitely not: a subset distinguished only by its content is not and never will be called a paragraph.  Visual splitting into paragraphs helps identify the stucture and hence the details of the content,never the other way round.

Thanks for the quick answers. I am indeed in the PDF camp, and printing 
through a PDF reader seems a very reasonable idea.

I use Acrobat Reader 8 under Kubunty Gutsy Linux distribution, and having just 
checked the printing options I don't seem to find anything that is close to 
scaling.

There is an information under the preview:
Units: inches    Zoom: 94%

The properties of my printer (XEROX DocuPrint N17) are rather few but there is 
a printer command line incorporated:
/usr/bin/lpr -P XEROX -o Resolution=default -o PageSize=A4 -o Duplex=None

It states to read the CUPS manual for details, is there a quick option to 
scale the document to 110% for example?


KPDF is another PDF reader that does provide more printing options, with 
access to System options (including CUPS server) but I am unable to find any 
scale command either :(


Cheers,
Adrian

In my copy of Reader (which is on a Mac), there is a "page scaling"
option in the print dialog.  The options are limited, but one of them
expands the occupied part of each document page to fill the printable
part of the paper.  I think it uses the same expansion for the whole
document.  I've done what you are trying to do using that before, though
I also modified the page header and footer to condense the original a
little bit.  (Moved the page numbers up into the header, as I recall, to
make the printed area a bit smaller, so the zoom would be a bit bigger.)

Unfortunately, I can't speak for a kubuntu distribution of Acrobat.

There are a bunch of scaling options in Acrobat professional, so if you
can find someone who has that, perhaps they could help.  You could also
look into the documentation for ghostscript.  As should be clear by
here, I know more about postscript than about PDF, so I'll shut up here
and maybe someone who knows more will chime in about manipulations
possible with readily available PDF tools.

I don't think lpr is going to help you much, though.  I think its
capacity is mostly just dispatching and adding a job header page, though
my beliefs on the point are not worth much.

Indeed, this is the "Fit to printable area" option, however I cannot detect 
any difference in the preview image. Shrink or fit the the printable area has 
not effect, where I was saying there is no option to *magnify* (or zoom) the 
text to the printable area.

Thanks very much anyways ;)
At first it seemed like a pretty straighforward task, but I guess what I want 
to achieve is not that easy.

Oh yes I read that FAQ, but this doesn't help. Of course I could try to play 
with the margins using the powerful geometry package, but setting narrower 
margins has the side effect of increasing the number of characters per line 
which is definitely not what I intend to do. Another effect is to lose the 
current number of pages, and I am happy the way it looks right now.

Perhaps setting narrower margins and *increasing* the base font size would 
help, but I found no trace of such a possibility in LaTeX. I understand that 
the base font size is 10pt. Is there any possibility to set it to, say, 12pt?

All this pstops and acrobat reader stuff was way over my head.  But
maybe I can chime in here.

\documentclass[12pt]{article}

will give 12 pt font for an article.  I don't know what class you are
using for your thesis, and whether it would work for that.  I also don't
know what effect this has on the size of math, etc.

Don't change the margins. Use koma or typearea if you don't like Lamport's
Layout, but don't think you are smarter than most typographers.

Depending on the complexity of your document you can use pgfpages

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{lipsum}

\usepackage{pgfpages}
\pgfpagesuselayout{resize to}
   [a4paper,border shrink=-1cm]

\begin{document}
\lipsum
\end{document}

You can use url.sty and define \UrlBreaks for a new url command

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{url}

\DeclareUrlCommand\stuff{\urlstyle{rm}}

\begin{document}

\stuff{MPW1K/6-311G(d,p)}

This thread accidentally illustrates one of the perils of adopting 
?black-box? solutions to a task such as typesetting. When you dodge the 
dvi > dvips > ps2pdf route to final output, you give up the access to 
fine adjustments that is easily available from dvips and ghostscript. 
(There would even be the possibility of going into the DVI file itself, 
and modifying the multiplication factor directly, but that seems more 
geeky than is necessary.) Years ago, before desktop lasers at 1200 dpi 
became available, I used to provide camera-ready copy (for a 
photographic plate-maker) at an effective 720 dpi by setting at the 
target size and using dvips to produce 600 dpi at \magstep1. Then the 
printer reduced the images back down to true size. (I could also have 
set \magnification at the beginning of the TeX document, and perhaps 
that can still be done in LaTeX.) A similar effect could be achieved in 
PostScript, but it might be necessary to bracket each page in a gsave 
grestore group. Dvips provides for that with bop-hook and eop-hook.


When you have nothing but PDF to work with, it seems, from the various 
recommendations made (including my own), that you are at the mercy of 
the gui printer menu, which is commonly put together by people who ?know 
much better than you do? what you want to do. One of the great things 
about using TeX and its auxiliary software is that you are liberated 
from this sort of arrogance.

I provided a LaTeX solution in the message you replied to (but 
did not quote). I don't see how that leaves you `at the mercy of 
the gui printer menu'.

Before you edit dvi files manually, look into the pdfTeX manual and
you'll be amazed to see what pdfTeX already can do for you.

It seems that you underestimate the capabilities of pdfTeX.

Message-ID: <62908.129.171.111.85.1196118638.squirrel@webmail.rsmas.miami.edu>

Hi,

I am writing my thesis in latex using a template that has been passed on
for many years now. Unfortunately for me they just updated the
requirements and some things have to change and I am no latex expert.

I am asked that whenever one of my title for one chapter (figure/table) is
more than one line to single space it and keep the double spacing between
the different items. And I cannot do it. I tried to modify my tex files in
several places (by adding a \begin{singlespace} command) but it does not
work like I want.

Could somebody please tell me what to do ?

Thank You,

Melicie

Dear All,

Having established (with some help from y'all in a previous thread)
that the pdfprintpagerange option of hyperref is useful, I'd like to
go to the next stage, and put something like a \pageref{} in it.  I've
tried each of:

\hypersetup{pdfprintpagerange={0 \pageref{endofhardcopy}}}
\hypersetup{pdfprintpagerange={0 \pageref*{endofhardcopy}}}
\hypersetup{pdfprintpagerange={0 \autopageref{endofhardcopy}}}
\hypersetup{pdfprintpagerange={0 \autopageref*{endofhardcopy}}}

but they all fail with the error

! Use of \pdfmark@ doesn't match its definition.
\@ifnextchar ... \reserved at d =#1\def \reserved at a {
                                                   #2}\def \reserved at b

Any ideas, please?

Thanks Christopher and Martin, I am little a little late with the answer 
because I get my emails in a daily digest unless you CC my address when you 
reply.
This is the solution indeed, I've previously tested [16pt] but it didn't work 
(I was not aware there are only 10, 11 and 12pt classes available) so I gave 
up the idea at the time.

I agree with Martin that margins should not be changed, however I believe I 
found a satisfactory solution using the geometry package with a 75% scale on 
A4 format:

\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{book}
\usepackage[vcentering,dvips]{geometry}
\geometry{a4paper, scale=0.75}

I actually counted the number of characters on multiple lines, they are 
similar to the default number in a regular latex document.

Thank you all once again,
Adrian

Or better maybe 

    \renewcommand{\thepage}{\thechapter\arabic{page}}  
or
    \renewcommand{\thepage}{\thesection\arabic{page}}

According as to whether you have chapters or sections as the main divisions.

Subject: [texhax] Strange behavior of \scantokens
Message-ID: <20071130215626.GA9226@thor>

Dear TeX hackers,

Can anybody please explain why the following code:

  \catcode`\^^M=13 \scantokens{x\endinput}x\bye

inserts a newline between the two x's?  What makes this really
mysterious is that when I change it to

  \scantokens{x\endinput}x\bye

I don't get a space between the x's.

I'm running this through

  $ pdftex --version
  pdfTeX using libpoppler 3.141592-1.40.3-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.6)
  kpathsea version 3.5.6

TIA for any clues,
Oleg

P.S.  FWIW, when I emulate \scantokens under vanilla tex, it behaves
exactly the same, so I suspect it's something about how TeX's \input
works.  My emulation is (from Texinfo via Eplain):

  \def\tmpfileextension{.tmp}%
  \let\tmpfilebasename = \jobname
  \newwrite\eplain at tmpfile
  \def\scantokens#1{%
    \toks@={#1}%
    \immediate\openout\eplain at tmpfile=\tmpfilebasename\tmpfileextension
    \immediate\write\eplain at tmpfile{\the\toks@}%
    \immediate\closeout\eplain at tmpfile
    \input \tmpfilebasename\tmpfileextension\relax
  }%

I mean "breaks the line between the two x's", of course.
