Hi,
  I want to embed a multi-page pdf file in a LaTeX document.  Is there an
easy way to do this other than to split it up into individual pages and
insert each one as a figure?
Thanks,
Jared

Subject: [texhax] Metafont: editing CM source files
Message-ID: <87648gi31x.fsf@gmail.com>

I tried to post the present message to the metafont mailing list
(metafont at ens.fr), but it seems to be not active any more: if there's one,
please can anyone indicate it?

Thanks





Hi.

I wanted to edit cmr12.mf to see what happens.
So I copied the original file into a work directory, changed its name and ran
metafont on it:

 $ mf my-cmr12.mf
 $ gftopk my-cmr12.2602gf

. Then, in my-file.tex I put:

\font\myfont=my-cmr12

\myfont

Hallo

\vfill\eject\end

, and then I do:

 $ tex my-file

. Now, the changes I do in my-cmr12.mf seem to produce no effect at all in the
my-file.dvi output file.  For example, if I change the 12pt size into 50pt, in
the dvi file the characters are always 12pt small.

Can anyone explain why?  What am I missing?
Please pardon the basicness of the question.

Thanks,
Rodolfo

Perhaps the following will do what you want:
\usepackage[final]{pdfpages}
...
\fullpage{1-5}{file-name}
for including pages 1 through 5 of the file named file-name.pdf

I'll take a look at those macros, which, if I understand what you say, cancel
TeX's capability of hyphenating?

But, on the other hand, I've always wanted to do without `makeindex' and use a
self, home made indexing program, which I could customize and modify at
pleasure: maybe the moment has come. I was taking a look at the two scripts:
index1.icn and index2.icn which are part of Tex for the Impatient, but don't
manage to make them work.
Please any indication with them?

Thanks, cheers
Rodolfo

That's what I meant.  They not necessarily disable hyphenation
directly, but may cause a side effect -- something like that.

I can't help with them -- never used them.  But beware, TODO for TeX
for the Impatient lists as one of the items converting the index
handling to MakeIndex!  In the view of that I'd not recommend to use
them.  Besides, there's a newer indexing program called xindy:

  http://xindy.sourceforge.net

which is supposed to address deficiencies of MakeIndex.  I've heard it
has a powerful style definition language which allows very complex
things, and supports non-Latin languages very well.  So my advice is
to try xindy (not that I've ever used it, so far I just could get away
with MakeIndex).

Best,
Oleg

    index1.icn and index2.icn which are part of Tex for the Impatient, 

They were Icon programs that Paul Abrahams wrote 15 years ago or so
because he liked Icon and had an implementation on his OS/2 box (or
whatever it was :) at the time.  I doubt they are useful as anything but
historical curiousities now.

xindy is what I'd look at for a new project.

Those are Icon programs (http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/).

Icon - and Unicon  (= oo-icon) are still available. and are very 
likely to run icon programs written for earlier releases. I have an 
uptodate version, Unicon 11.3 .  Windows and linux versions  are well 
supported. 

Whether you feel the programs are useful is a different matter. 
I believe I have the icon & TeX skills to get them going again if 
this route is felt to be useful.

%suggest:

%\typein[\files]{Now put in includeonly}
%\includeonly{\files}

so are you typing in a list of files?

I am now familar with using \typein as providing arguments to a

I suspect the above command fails 
because there is no \newcommand\files{...}

correct syntax is a comma-delimited list of any of sections/chapters

i.e.: any one of following:

It occurred to me that the problem you have is related to the badness.
The index is (usually) typeset in ragged-right mode, but a good
ragged-right setting does not just allow lines to break anywhere, it
still does badness checking to avoid very short lines (it's somewhere
in The TeXbook, look up \raggedright in the index).  So, your
discretionary hyphen (\-) is ignored simply because breaking there
would be too bad, according to TeX's notion.  The solution is to
change TeX's notion about badness -- try tweaking \tolerance setting
for the index.

HTH,
Oleg

I doubt that helps; but the ragged2e package might.

    try tweaking \tolerance setting

Also, some \raggedright's explicitly disable hyphenation completely.
In that case, you may need (something like)
\hyphenpenalty=50
\exhyphenpenalty=50

Me and some collegues of mine are working on a textbook which at the 
final stage will most probably end up as a LaTex document.  One of us 
in for the most part located in Germany, another partially in Germany 
and partially in Norway, and the third one will mostly be located in 
Norway.

In this project, we have up to now been working with a Wiki (PmWiki), 
which is nice, but somewhat inflexible, we would like to be able to 
see the whole thing in some way or another, preferably as a fresh 
build in PDF format from the source.

Does a internet based collaborative tool we could use oriented towards 
latex exist?

They aren't exactly oriented towards LaTeX, but many documentation
projects use CVS or SVN

  http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/
  http://subversion.tigris.org/

They require a server to be set up with the repository to which
developers can connect and synchronize their copies.  If that's a
problem, you can start a project on savannah.nongnu.org, sarovar.org
or sourceforge.net (there are probably other hosts around).

BTW, nice free books on CVS and SVN are available:

  http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/

Oleg's suggestion seems to work the problem out in the sense that the overfull
box is avoided, although hyphenation is not done either; instead,

\hyphenpenalty=50
\exhyphenpenalty=50

produces no result: we have no hyphenation *and* overfull box.

...But now another problem:
two different \item(s) in the .ind file are usually separated by an
\indexspace, but sometimes they are not: in the latter case they are much too
near and the result is ugly.  Any suggestion about that?  How to have always an
indexspace between two items?

Could well be that hyphenation is disabled, as suggested by Karl.

Did you try both, that is, something like

\hyphenpenalty=50
\exhyphenpenalty=50
\tolerance=1000 % (or even more)

Without the \tolerance changed, the first two lines enable
hyphenation, but TeX might still refuse to hyphenate at a break which
gives badness greater than the current setting of \tolerance.

\indexspace is only inserted between groups, that is, when the initial
letter of the index terms change.  Within the group, there is no
\indexspace between \item's.

Instead, you might try redefining \item and add extra space after an
item.

No, it seems that TeX refuses definitely to hyphenate in this case.  But, after
all, with raggedright mode hyphenation does not maybe make much sense.  My
actual problem was more the overfull box that non-hyphenation itself.  The
output looks nice enough, now.

Cheers,
Rodolfo

If it's just for formatting purposes, there's no problem with changing

Maybe before reading the files, do
\def\addcontentsline#1#2#3{}

?

( I need to use them in a document with mathpazo font
and using pdfLaTeX.)

(i) An upper semicircle
so that a macro like \semi{X} places a semicircle on top
of the letter "X"  (the symbol \frown is not what I am
looking for, but a half circle).

  (ii) same as above, with the central dot includec.

  Any help will be appreciated.

Hi,

I'm creating a class in which I want to set the width of a minipage equal to
\pagewidth divided by a user-entered count.  How do I divide \pagewidth by a
count?

Yes indeed, it seems that their server is a bit slow.

Nothing more than want you did :) Just be patient and try again (I  
tried and it eventually worked). Or alternatively, try
http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/getFile.py?fn=/systems/mac/mactex/ 
MacTeX-20070222.dmg
which has some other mirrors.

Are you sure that nothing happens?  Did you check the 'downloads'  
window (available in the "Window" menu)?  The .dmg is very large, and  
can take quite a while to download.

Swami Pallasena asks:

    I am looking for two news symbols that are yet not available
    in The Comprehensive LaTeX Symbols List in CTAN.
    ( I need to use them in a document with mathpazo font
    and using pdfLaTeX.)

    (i) An upper semicircle
    so that a macro like \semi{X} places a semicircle on top
    of the letter "X"  (the symbol \frown is not what I am
    looking for, but a half circle).

      (ii) same as above, with the central dot includec.

      Any help will be appreciated.

the font lcircle -- used for the latex picture
environment -- has quarter circles that should
be able to be put together into appropriate
semicircles.  i don't have time to do this,
unfortunately, but maybe this will give someone
else an idea for where to start.

but i am interested in what is the meaning of
the two symbols as described.  i have been
working with the stix group to get new symbols
into unicode, and i've never heard of these two.
the unicode technical committee has accepted
the premise that math/technical notation is
open ended, and are amenable to encoding more
"generally accepted" symbols, provided these
symbols are presented with
 - a clear indication of how they're used
 - examples *in context*, preferably showing
   at least one instance with a definition

Message-ID: <200704042227.l34MRcN11273@f7.net>

    How do I save/restore the original definition of \addcontentsline in 
    that scheme?

Don't know if it works, but:

\let\saveacl=\addcontentsline
\def\addcontentsline#1#2#3{}

\include{gpl.tex}

\let\addcontentsline=\saveacl


By the way, it seems fdl.tex was apparently created as a standalone
document (with \documentclass, etc.), rather than as a chapter.
(gpl.tex is a \chapter.)

Maybe the simplest way would be to make a pdf or whatever and then
include that.

Good luck,
Karl

hi, list.
  I'm a newbie of the latex, now I'm reading lshort.pdf to gain the base

  I find that I can't understand some commands' meaning, say \textrm
  (although I know it means text roman from other friends). So, where
  can I find a abbreviated command's full name?
  Maybe I did not express myself clearly.
  Thank you.

I don't think there is any such list, at least not an official  
comprehensive one, to my knowledge.

All you can do is as in any situation where you have to use commands:  
first you learn them, then you think of them as mnemonics so as to  
help remember the command for the next time. Of course, a command's  
name is not always very straightforward, but with a bit of  
imagination and experience, you'll get it.

Anyway, this shouldn't keep you back in your learning of LaTeX.

Subject: [texhax] Matrices/alignment -- Repeated template at beginning?
Message-ID: <C23D2923.37B5A%leingang@math.harvard.edu>

Hi,

I'm trying to typeset matrices where the last column is separated from the
rest by a vertical bar.  Normally I can use

\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\
...
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 
\end{array}\right]

This is a suitable workaround.  But I also like to use the gauss package to
typeset row operations.  To have *both* the vertical bar and the rowops, I
need a matrix-like environment that does the vertical bar automatically.
Then I can pass that environment to the gauss package.

Looking in the TeX by Topic Book, I've found that the matrix-like
environments use \ialign, and a feature of that that allows for an arbitrary
number of columns:  If the preamble has a && rather than a &, the rest of
the preamble can be repeated as much as needed.  So the matrix environment
uses a preamble something like {\hfil$#$\hfil && \quad\hfil$#$\hfil\crcr}

This preamble allows for the first column, or first group of columns, to be
different from the rest.  Is there a way to make the *last* column different
from the rest?

Any clues would be appreciated.  TIA.

Your FAQ doesn't appear to have been posted to *.answers for at least 90

In keeping with efforts by the Big-8 Management Board and other users of
Usenet to restore the usefulness of Usenet ad a discussion medium, I'm
trying to pull *.answers and the rtfm.mit.edu FAQ archive to something
approximating to normal operation after several years of neglect.

Accordingly, it would be extremeley helpful for us to know the status of
your Usenet FAQ (or FAQs).

Can you please let me know via news-answers-request at MIT.EDU (or by
replying directly to this message) whether you intend to continue
posting? (Quoting the name and archive-name of your FAQ(s) will help me to
process replies more quickly.)

If your FAQ is no longer posted, I will mark it as such in our records

Alternatively, if you wish to continue posting your FAQ but are having
problems crossposting it to *.answers, I will be happy to offer advice.

Thanks for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear All,
Sometimes when I compile a document, Underfull box and Overfull box warning
message came out. But when I see the output document (I prefer to make a pdf
file as output file), I didn't see anything that out of the body text. All
of the body text printed so well (the right edge of the body look fine). So,
my question are why those message (underfull and overfull box) still appear
and how to fix those problems?

You can make overfull boxes visible if you set the LaTeX documentclass
option 'draft'.  In plain TeX you can say \overfullrule=5pt.  The
latter will work with LaTeX too.  I mention this because some LaTeX
packages behave different if the draft option is set.

You simply do not see {over,under}full boxes because TeX is less
tolerant than you.

If you are using pdflatex you can try

   \usepackage{microtype}

and many of the bad-box-messages will disappear.  Maybe it even
results in less hyphenations.  microtype is a LaTeX package which
depends on pdftex, hence pdflatex is required.  It also requires a
recent TeX distribution, at least pdftex-1.30.

BTW, your mail contains plain text and HTML.  It would be nice if you
can avoid HTML when you post to mailing list (at least).

Regards,
  Reinhard

Try using 'gs'. A simple example of joining two files into one is

Hello list,


I've got a problem which I'm struggling with for a week.  I would like
to write a macro that creates a (LaTeX) \label of the lowercase text
of its argument:

\def\MyLabel#1{\label{\lowercase{#1}}

Obviously it doesn't work.  My conception was that the problem is
\lowercase, which is processed "in the stomach" of the interpreter
(according to the TRM).  So I began to write macros that aviod
calling both \lowercase and \lccode, and I've come up with this:
(I'm just getting into virgin tex; nevertheless the macros are
intended for LaTeX usage)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Returns the lower case counterpart of character #1 if it is a
% capital letter, or #1 otherwise.
\def\LowChar#1{%
        \ifnum`#1=`A a\else\ifnum`#1=`B b\else\ifnum`#1=`C c\else
        \ifnum`#1=`D d\else\ifnum`#1=`E e\else\ifnum`#1=`F f\else
        \ifnum`#1=`G g\else\ifnum`#1=`H h\else\ifnum`#1=`I i\else
        \ifnum`#1=`J j\else\ifnum`#1=`K k\else\ifnum`#1=`L l\else
        \ifnum`#1=`M m\else\ifnum`#1=`N n\else\ifnum`#1=`O o\else
        \ifnum`#1=`P p\else\ifnum`#1=`Q q\else\ifnum`#1=`R r\else
        \ifnum`#1=`S s\else\ifnum`#1=`T t\else\ifnum`#1=`U u\else
        \ifnum`#1=`V v\else\ifnum`#1=`W w\else\ifnum`#1=`X x\else
        \ifnum`#1=`Y y\else\ifnum`#1=`Z z\else #1%
        \fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi
        \fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi\fi}

% Cycle through the characters of the string via tail recursion.
\def\lowit at b#1#2\@{%
        \def\lowit at tmp{#1}%
        \expandafter\ifx\lowit at tmp\empty\else
                \edef\lowit at buf{\lowit at buf \LowChar#1}%
                \lowit at b#2\@
        \fi}

% The lowercase string is stored in \lowit at buf temporarily.
\def\lowit at a#1{%
        \def\lowit at buf{}%
        \expandafter\lowit at b#1\empty\empty\@%
        \lowit at buf\egroup}

% This is the entry point.  It takes a string and expands to its lowercase.
% The \catcode manipulations are necessarry so \lowit at b won't ignore whitespace.
\def\LowIt{%
        \bgroup%
        \def\whitespace{ }%
        \catcode`\ =\active\lccode`\~`\ \lowercase{\let~\whitespace}%
        \catcode`\^^I=\active\lccode`\~`\^^I\lowercase{\let~\whitespace}%
        \catcode`\^^M=\active\lccode`\~`\^^M\lowercase{\let~\whitespace}%
        \lowit at a}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Now, LowIt{BLA BLA BLA} is typeset to ``bla bla bla'' correctly; I was
very happy to see that.  However, when I try to \typeout{\LowIt{BLA BLA}
the whole thing blows up because \typeout (and \label for that matter)
seem to \edef \LowIt; then tex starts complaining about \whitespace being
undefined.  Ouch.

Earlier someone (Uwe?) posted a code fragment that looked primising:
\newcommand{\foo}{%
        \stepcounter{foo}%
        \edef\thelabel{\noexpand\label{bar:\thefoo}}%
        \thelabel}

While it does magic with \label, I could not apply the idea to my problem.
Can you give me a hand?

The \ref command is built-in (as is the basic \cite command), but
there is no facility for multiple arguments.  It is more problematical
how to handle such multi-ref, because it is not a part of normal
typesetting.

Start with a LaTeX reference and clsguide. Followup with the LaTeX
companion (and the TeXbook, if you want to dive in deep).

There is an excellent paper explaining how to make your own document
class: "Rolling your own Document Class: Using LaTeX to keep away from
the Dark Side" by Peter Flynn, from issue 2006-4 in The PracTeX
Journal.

It is available online as a PDF free of charge at:
http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/flynn/

Good luck,
Yuri Robbers.

Writing a class or package is not nearly the rocket science
I thought it would be.

Class  : What is your base class?
Package: what functionality do you want to add to whatever class you are
using in your writing?

Find something similar, copy it 
make a test.tex get it and keep it running
while you go down your checklist of what you want different.

I have written only one class for my conference papers:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/conferences/sugconf
/

It is not perfect but it gets the job done.

Only if the last page in the preceding chapter is an odd page and you  
*don't* use the option openany, as in

\documentclass[openany]{book}

Message-ID: <461D7B78.4020802@cantab.net>


Hi,

I've used LaTeX for many years, but am fairly new to (La)TeX hacking, so 
I apologise if this turns out to be a trivial question. I've tried 
reading the FAQ, Tex-by-topic, and the documented LaTeX2e source, but 
still don't fully understand what's going wrong.

I have a series of macros defined as:

\def\sref at type#1{%
   \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter%
   \sref@@type\csname r@#1\endcsname}
\def\sref@@type#1#2{\sref@@@type#1[]}
\def\sref@@@type{\@ifnextchar[%]
   {\sref@@@@type}{\sref@@@@type[]}}
\def\sref@@@@type[#1]#2[]{#1}

(I guess it's probably possible to collapse this down to one or two 
macros once I can get them working correctly.) The \r@#1 commands expand 
to something of the form {[type]a}{b}, and I want \sref at type{#1} to 
return the "type". This works fine until I try to use it inside \edef or 
(more importantly for my purposes) inside \csname...\endcsname. E.g. 
assuming \r at ref expands as just described,

   \def\sref at tmpa#1{\sref at type{ref}}

throws an "Argument of \sref@@type has an extra }" error, followed by a 
"TeX capacity exceeded" error. On the other hand, the line

   \expandafter\ifx\csname \sref at type{ref}@yaddayadda\endcsname\relax

throws "Missing \endcsname inserted" followed by "Extra \endcsname". I 
vaguely gather that this might be a problem with the command being 
fragile (due to the \@ifnextchar?), therefore requiring the command 
definition to be protected and any \edef to be replaced by 
\protected at edef or some such. But naively protecting the macros doesn't 
work, and I still don't understand how to achieve what I need: a way to 
use the "type" part of r@#1 inside a \csname...\endcsname in order to 
construct a new command sequence from it.

Can anyone put me out of my misery? I'd very much appreciate an 
explanation of what's going wrong, as well as a solution.

Thanks very much,

Toby Cubitt

I am working in an information service company, and we are using 3B2 which
based on SGML/XML, but we want to develop another typesetting system, the
main ideas are:

1. still based on SGML/XML
2. we have various journal which have various article type, such as book
review, normal article and editorial paper etc, so I think I should write
classes for all different article types (also different journals)

Thanks again

For this scenario, I definitely recommend having a look at ConTeXt
(http://www.contextgarden.net). IMHO It is suited much better for
publication needs than LaTeX and already has some support for XML
input.

The \r@#1 commands sometimes expand to something of the form {a}{b}
instead, hence the whole \@ifnextchar stuff.

you have some choices:
* different class for each article type
  e.g.:
%\documentclass{article}%standard LaTeX
%\documentclass{refrep}%%standard LaTeX

%\documentclass{CWbookreview}%%in-house 
%\documentclass{CWarticle}%%in-house 
%\documentclass{CWeditorial}%%in-house 

* one class with parameter of article type
%\documentclass{CWarticle}%%in-house 
%\documentclass[bookreview]{CWarticle}%%in-house 
%\documentclass[editorial]{CWarticle}%%in-house 

from my own perspective as a programmer
I would recommend that you review the standard LaTeX classes first
* make CWarticle first by copying e.g. article.cls
* make CWbookreview, etc. 

Next year, you can consolidate each of your classes
into your CW<Does-It-All> class with parameters

The reason I suggest the above process is:
* you have to learn to read TeX in order to write a class or package
  warning: learning curve ahead
           steepness associated 
                  or correlated with your programming expertise
* having to learn the boolean and testing features of TeX
  while you are writing, testing, and developing a class 
  makes the learning curve steeper

summary: KIS: Keep It Simple
* find something that works
* copy it: keep it working
loop:   modify it: keep it working
        when satisfied, goto done
repeat: go to loop
done  : "Hey boss, check this out!" 

The easiest way, of course, is not to write a class,
but a package:
just add, change or delete what the standard class does

%\documentclass{article}%
\usepackage{CWarticle}
%\usepackage{CWbookreview}

Those are areas of macro expansion only, no typesetting or
even assignments.  \@ifnextchar uses assignments, and is not 
purely expandable, so it can't work.  You should instead use
a definitive end-marker token and consume all arguments as
macro parameters.

Since the point of the \@ifnextchar seems to be to insert an
empty "type" when there is none, then why not just latch on
to the empty [] at the end...

 \def\sref at type#1{%
    \expandafter\expandafter\expandafter%
    \sref@@type\csname r@#1\endcsname}

 \def\sref@@type#1#2{\sref@@@type#1[]\delimiter}

 \def\sref@@@type#1[#2]#3\delimiter{#2}

While purely expandable macros are indeed robust in all cases,
there are also robust commands that are not expandable.  Moreover,
no ammount of \protect will make your macro work by expansion.

I fear that LaTeX will complain if \documentclass does not exist.  I
agree that the easiest way is to modify an existing document class.
However, the most reasonable way to do this is described in:

  http://www.latex-project.org/guides/clsguide.pdf

Since the sources are in XML, I strongly recommend to consider a
Context based solution too.  Besides the XML parser, one of Context's
strength is page layout.

    Available is one question, installed is another.

All the free fonts with TeX support are in TeX Live.

    It doesn't help that apparently plain TeX uses one set of mappings and 
    pdftex another. 

Yes, pdftex and dvipdfmx and dvips each have their own map file format,
although they are 95% the same.  There is no good reason for them not to
be consolidated, but I doubt it will happen in the foreseeable future.
updmap maintains them all in sync.

    But perhaps the map files could be catenated, sorted and dupes
    eliminated. A subset map file that dealt only with the fonts
    actually included in TeXLive would be a great help.

I don't understand.  If you install TL, the resulting psfonts.map file
and related will include only the fonts in TL (according to whichever
packages you install), of course.  There are no duplicate entries.

    I look for fonts that can be used in books in English. If anyone has
    run all those down that would be a start.

That's exactly what my tug.org/fonts tries to list.
Additional free fonts, not necessarily with TeX support,
are listed at http://www.geocities.com/hartke01/.  (Another excellent
page by Stephen Hartke.)

Available is one question, installed is another. I can conceive of a 
scheme that first identified the names of all the tfm files 
installed, then used one or more map files to identify the "real" 
font involved, and finally searched for the existence of that real 
file.  Alternatively one could start with a list of all the pfb files 
on the system and search the composite map files for instances where 
those pfb files were referenced. The names of the pfb files and the 
tfm files are unfortunately not identical or even in a one to one 
relationship. And then there are truetype...

It doesn't help that apparently plain TeX uses one set of mappings and 
pdftex another. But perhaps the map files could be catenated, sorted 
and dupes eliminated. A subset map file that dealt only with the 
fonts actually included in TeXLive would be a great help. 

I am not personally involved with non-western fonts. I look for fonts 
that can be used in books in English. If anyone has run all those 
down that would be a start. 

I will do some sifting and sorting today to see what is what on my 
base texlive 2007 installation. This will exclude the Ghostscript, 
Gimp etc. fonts as well as my texmf-local fonts but I can track them 
down when needed. I will create a pdf showing what I have found, an 
available type 1 font listing with A-Z and a-z as well as sample 
text.

The first fruits of that effort are available in the following file:
http://wexfordpress.com/tex/fontfile.pdf
This pdf runs over 12mb (91 pages) so be advised. 

Here was my method:
First I collected  the names of all the pfb files in texlive 2007. I 
created an index of these names. Then I matched the records in 
pdftex.map against these pfb files. There were  1,094 matches. I 
generated entries in a TeX file for each matched font.  Each entry 
consists of the pdftex.map line (in a few cases truncated) followed 
by uppercase A-Z and lowercase a-z, at 12pt. 

I had one suprise. I knew that most fonts in pdftex.map had no 
corresponding pfb files. What I did not expect was that 39 matched 
map file and pfb file pairs apparently did not have a corresponding 
tfm file. I will investigate this further. 

I only looked at Type 1 fonts. There are 22 truetype fonts listed in 
pdftex.map. Again I will look further. 

I will also reverse my match, and determine how many pfb files (if 
any) exist in texlive but are not found in pdftex.map. 

Stay tuned!

I am still working on my font listing project. I have a series of 
fonts that I cannot process properly. They appear to be different 
sizes of the same base pfb file.
For example file sfxc3583.pfb exists.
The following line appears in pdftex.map:
laxc3583 SFXC3583 "T2AEncoding ReEncodeFont" <cm-super-t2a.enc 
<sfxc3583.pfb

But laxc3583 doesn't seem to appear anywhere on my system.  And the 
system tries but cannot generate a tfm file when I use this:
\font\rx laxc3583

There are dozens of these instances. Must I generate each tfm 
individually with afm2tfm or the like?

Subject: [texhax] Retrieving the value of a counter from previous run
Message-ID: <1176495559.5816.44.camel@sony-sjs.sp.ph.ic.ac.uk>

This must be easy, but I can't find out how.

I have a counter I use to count names in an included file:

master.tex has:

\newcounter{nnames}
\newcommand\nextname[1]{#1\addtocounter{nnames}{1}}

...

\include{names}

...


names.tex has:

The following \arabic{nnames}\ all agree with me:

%\setcounter{nnames}{0}  %this is what I had in mind to restart

\nextname{Joe Bloggs}
\nextname{Fred Smith}

...

So the idea is to count the names on the first pass through the file,
and then pick up that value on subsequent passes. The problem seems to
be (a) the \newcounter command resets the counter to zero (as one might
expect and normally want) and (b) the value from the previous run (which
I can see in the \@setckpt in names.aux) is then inside the scope of
that checkpoint.

Changing \include to \input needs something else to get a line:

\setcounter{nnames}{xx}

into the main aux file I guess.

Thanks for any help.

Steve

Hi John,
yes, it took some time to download the file, but doesn't it make sense

I think I understand now. \let and \def are not expandable, so \edef and
\csname just leave them alone when expanding. The result is that
whatever is being \let or \def'ed gets expanded, and chaos ensues!

That's a really neat solution! I was in fact using the "[]" as an
end-delimeter, not being aware of the convention of using \@nil or
\delimeter or some such. I like the way your solution turns my ignorance
to use :)

Robin Fairbairns suggested (off-list) using a macro that defines a macro
in this kind of situation, which I guess is a more generally applicable
solution (i.e. the macro defines \@result to hold the "type", and
\@result *is* then expandable).

Yes, I see that now. It's taking a while to get used to the fact that
macro expansion is nothing like evaluation in a normal procedural
language (it just appears similar by accident, occasionally).

Thanks a lot for taking the time to explain this,

I'm not positive on this, but I recall that tfm files are generated on
the fly by mktextfm from metafont sources for LH fonts (even though
pdftex might actually use pfb file, not pk).  So most probably you
don't have write permissions for the directory where tfm files are
stored.

Try processing your TeX file once as root (or any other user which has
permissions to write tfm), so that the tfm files are created.
Thereafter you should be able to process TeX files as a normal user.

Yep, just take a look at how the \label and \ref commands work, for example.

Heavens. I used/am using half a dozen COBOL programs, some Linux/unix 
utilities and the Gvim editor. And that was as advertised a first 
effort. I have a much better one underway now that will include 
significant numbers of fonts that were wrongly excluded before, and 
exclude a bunch for which there is no TFM file.

Anyone brave enough to delve into my COBOLisms can write me and I will 
ship the sources and some instructions.

I didn't expect that you are so old. :)  I always thought that I'm the
oldest on this list, but the first programming language I learned at
the university was Algol68.  At this time no courses about COBOL had
been offered any more.

I have write permissions ot the entire texlive tree. So that is not 
the solution. The problem is with fonts where the tfm name is not the 
same as the pfb name. I don't know why there are so many such 
combinations listed in pdftex.map. I see no use for these lines. The 
tfm does not exist and there is no easy way to generate it.

Hello!
I am a newbie in LaTeX, hence, sorry for my ignorance. In brief, I am
working on an article, in English. However, there are few references,
from my bib file, containing peculiar letters of Slovenian, Croatian,

cannot get \{DJ} and \{dj}, although they are fine in the document (i.e.

Can anyone help me with this issue? It is not nice to have Dj and/or dj
instead of proper letter.

COBOL is however alive and well and supported by uderground cells 
consisting of old hacks like me. I greeted the grandmother of COBOL, 
the naval officer Grace Murray Hopper, twice at local ACM 
(Association of Computing Machinery) meetings in Baltimore.  I wrote 
my first COBOL program in 1968 and my most recent one yesterday.
And for the curious I will have lived .75 century on Aug 25 of this 
year. But I am living proof that age per se does not of necessity  
confer wisdom nor even maturity, only hair loss and BPH.

The latest iteration of my font sampler effort is represented by pdf 
files xaa.pdf through xaj.pdf. These are being uploaded as I write 
this. I will have to create a page of download buttons.

Why so many files? Well, TeX has a limit on how many fonts can be 
included in a single run. There are about 3100 fonts usable straight 
out of the (pdftex) box. My subfiles illustrate about 400 fonts each. 
I will figure out a way to cojmbine them somehow, but the plethora of 
fonts may also frustrate that effort. Most of the 3100 fonts are 
uninteresting, consisting of size variations on relatively few fonts.  
Some very common book fonts, such as Garamond, Sabon, Lucida and 
Georgia are not included among the free fonts shipped withTex.

I will continue to refine the effort as time permits.

Would includeing \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc} in the preamble help?. 
  It works with Norwegian at least.

I think your problem is a combination of elements :

1) I think you are assuming that all accented characters
    have a simple representation in TeX, and

2) I think you are assuming that the default TeX fonts
    include the Slovenian/Croation/Serbian \DJ and \dj
    characters (note that these would be the preferred
    forms, not \{DJ} or \{dj}, neither of which could
    be understood by (La)TeX).

Sadly neither of these is the case.  It may well be
that the new "Latin Modern" fonts have the necessary
characters, but I leave it up to those more familiar
with these fonts to advise here.  If they do, then
you will probably need to load a macro package to
tell TeX how to interpret \DJ and \dj, neither of
which are pre-defined in (La)TeX.

If you can tell us exactly how \DJ and \dj /should/
look (ideally by pointing at a Unicode web page which
contains those characters, and telling us where to
look), we may be able to advise further.  (I took
a quick look at http://www.slovenia.info/?lng=1&id_country=1
but was unable to spot anything that might have been
a \DJ or \dj glyph).

Use \label at the end of the document.

You either have to do \refstepcounter at the end, or define 
\@currentlabel.

Look at the package nofm or similar (usually for page numbering).

Are these sequences case sensitive?  If so, it might be relevant that
BibTeX sometimes changes the case of the text given to it.  You can
stop it doing so by enclosing the whole sequence in braces,
e.g. {\{DJ}} or {\{dj}}.

The subfiles in pdf form are available on:

Each subfile has roughly 400 fonts.  I will continue to refine the 
project.

Yes.  There is a subtle distinction as follows.

When expansion happens out of step with assignments, Lamport
calls that a "moving argument".  Commands that rely on both 
expansion and assignments are "fragile".  To handle the problems 
there is the \protect command that delays expansion until whenever 
assignments will be processed.  Commands that survive a moving
argument intact are called "robust" and are of three types:
Ones that are simple unexpandable tokens, like \beta declared
by \mathchardef; ones that expand "completely" without assignments;
and ones that are defined using \protect internally (self-protecting
commands that would otherwise be fragile).

The distinction comes in the argument of \csname where the 
\protect mechanism won't work.  Not only is \protect not usually
enabled, but there is no way to delay expansion because the
assignments will never be processed.  Only s subset of robust
commands, the completely expandable ones, work in this case.

They are more closely coupled in TeX than in other languages
(like C) which leads to the confusion.  I think it is a big
design misfeature that assignments happen separately from 
conditionals.

Thank you all for the help. I managed to solve the problem with the hint

Also, letters are:

? - U+0110 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH STROKE

? - U+0111 LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH STROKE

Hello,
Need help to left justify second line of the nested list below (further
explanation and code example).

The code below under "\item[(c)] Pipe friction... given by $64/Re$.\\" is a
two line list item. The second line protrudes out to the left of the first
line. This only seems to happen in the nested list. In "\item[(i)] and
\item[(iii)]..." all the lines of the paragraph are properly left justified.

Thanks in advance for your help!
Vince

Code------------------
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Consider water flowing though a cast iron pipe having length $L$
of 100 $m$ , diameter $d$ of 200 $mm$ and a full flow rate of 100 $L/s$.
Calculate the following:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)]{\hspace{-84pt}\reversemarginpar{(2)}} \hspace{65pt}
    The average fluid velocity $V$ in $m/s$. \\
    \item[(b)]{\hspace{-84pt}\reversemarginpar{(2)}} \hspace{65pt}
    Reynolds number $Re$ and type of flow (i.e., laminar or turbulent). \\
    \item[(b)]{\hspace{-84pt}\reversemarginpar{(2)}} \hspace{65pt}
    Pipe friction loss $H_f$ in $m$. Recall that the friction factor $f$
under laminar flow conditions is given by $64/Re$. \\

A clay tile lined trapezoidal channel experiences uniform flow at a normal

It comes with most TeX distributions. It is included in TeXLive 2005 
and 2007. TeXlive runs on most major platforms.  If your distro 
doesn't have pstricks for some strange reason I suggest you just 
download it from a CTAN mirror and put the files (there are about 10) 
in  
~/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pstricks/pstricks.tex
Then run texhash.

Here is what my directory contains:
Changes       pst-key.tex   pst-plot.tex  pstricks.con  textures.con
dvipsone.con  pst-node.tex  pst-tree.tex  pstricks.tex  vtex.con

I just
 \input pstricks.tex 
in pdftex documents. The LaTeX and Context conventions are a bit 
different but not esoteric. Context needs you to:
\usemodule[pstric]

The LaTeX code is left as an exercise for the student. 
 
I know nothing about TeXShop. Being a simple soul I just edit in Gvim.

And how would you want TeX to respond to an ancronym such as UN or 
CTAN?

It would not be difficult to set up a series of macros such as
\def\A{ A}
\def\B{ B}
etc.
...which would insert a (possibly superfluous) space in front of every 
cap, but sensing whether the next letter was also a cap would be more 
challenging. 

A Vim macro might be able to handle the acronym problem but the 
prospect of writing it makes my head hurt. Or while using vim one 
could enter:
:%s/[A-Z]/ &/gc
and hit y or n depending on the nature of the occurrence found. 
I just tested this and it works but is tedious.

 I suggest just proofreading, unless you have a document where such 
mistakes occur often.

    The problem is with fonts where the tfm name is not the 
    same as the pfb name.

This is, as you note, very common.  That is how we handle the TeX 256
chars per encoding limitation -- OT1, T1, texnansi, etc., each have to
have their own tfm, even if they all map to a single pfb.

Indeed, the Cyrillic font tfm's are generated by mktextfm.  There are
scripts in the lh distribution to do it all in batch if you're so
inclined.  Probably not very interesting for purposes of a font
catalogue, in any case.  (It could be interesting if each font had the
supported encodings listed, though.)

I am puzzled by one thing however. If the particular encoding has the 
pfb file included in TeXLive, and there is a line in pdftex.map 
referring to the tfm file, then why is the tfm itself not included? 
Is it a space limitation?  

The listing in pdftex.map seems to have no utility since the font 
variant can't be used "out of the box". 

I can manipulate my programs  to list the missing tfms if that is what 
you are driving at.  I already wrote the programs to exclude these 
bad boys from my font catalog. Generating a listing would be no big 
deal.

Gag! Don't do such nonsense! You introduce unbalanced \hspace and
inter-word spaces to give the following text the wrong position.
You also end a paragraph with \\ which you should never do.

Your mixture of the numeric tags with the list item tags looks like
a bad decision, but the attempted implementation really stinks.

Do you know what \reversemarginpar means?  I think you were trying
to use \marginpar{} without any silly \hspace.

I think this is more likely something to be done by your editor than 
your typesetting package. Emacs could be configured to do it I guess, but 
again, why? Surely you want to proof read documents, you might have put 
the wrong word somewhere rather than joining two together.

In Context the nested itemize command works smoothly. And there is 
also the \definedescription  command that lets one set up things 
pretty much however you want without much fuss and feathers.  I think 
all newcomers to TeX should read the Context manuals as well as the 
LaTeX manuals to determine which set of features suit them best.  
Neither  variant is all conquering but I find Context the more 
flexible.

Subject: [texhax] Modifying margins for large tables/figures
Message-ID: <861389.82623.qm@web81610.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi.  I am running MiKTeX 2.5 in Windows.  I am attempting to print some very large tables within a report and am finding it difficult to change the margins selectively for the pages containing the tables.  Note that I want the default TeX margins for all pages excepting those containing the set of large tables.  I have looked at the information on margins as well as several packages such as the geometry package but all seem to require the changes to occur at the document level.  I have also tried the chngpage package but it seems to leave the margins untouched for the table while typed text is placed within the new, modified margins. Are there commands/packages that allow a user to change the margins selectively for tables/figures or is there a way to have a separate file with its own document class and thus a separate compile included within a larger document with a different document class?  Thanks for the assistance!

Hi John,

    why is the tfm itself not included? 
    Is it a space limitation?  

Partly space reasons, partly historical.

    The listing in pdftex.map seems to have no utility since the font
    variant can't be used "out of the box".

No, it should work.  All the infrastructure is there to build the tfm's
dynamically via mktextfm, so the TeX document just says \font\foo=larxc
or whatever it is and it gets built.

    I can manipulate my programs to list the missing tfms

Sure, I'd be interested in seeing the list so I can check for non-lh
"missing" tfm's, since mktextfm isn't extensively used for any other
font package that I can think of.

    if that is what you are driving at.

Not really, the "missing" tfm's are an independent issue.  I was
pointing out that building a good font catalogue for a distribution
needs more work than listing a zillion tfm and FontNames.  The ideal
would be a one-page condensation :).

Best,
Karl

Using what product, pdftex, pdflatex or Context?  The answer is 
different for each choice.

I have been generating both ps and pdf's.  I have been using pdflatex for my pdf generation.  In the end we will probably choose to use the pdf format exclusively.  Thanks for the assistance.

Perhaps textarea.sty suits you.

Subject: [texhax] making underscore a letter
Message-ID: <20070419110100.GB16960@saturnus.vein.hu>


Hello again,


Do you know about a compelling reason why '_' is left to be the
subscription character in normal mode in LaTeX?

I'm writing a package of authoring macros, some of them are like

\def\Code#1{\hypertarget{#1}{\texttt{#1}}}

so later #1 can be \hyperlink-ed.  Now, \Code{some_funny_function()}
is obviously a problem: left as it is makes latex complaint, escaping
the underscores makes hyperref think weird things.

To cut the problem short I've decided to make '_' a letter, so latex
would accept it in normal mode:

\catcode`_=11
\everymath\expandafter{\the\everymath\catcode`_=8}
\everydisplay\expandafter{\the\everydisplay\catcode`_=8}

What I'd like to know is, do you agree with this approach?
What trouble should I prepare for?  I'm using pdflatex,
hyperref, and {listings}.

Thanks,
adam

Don't be silly.  It works smoothly in LaTeX too, and you get
misalignment in eiather when you insert random hskips.

As I recall, context had the terrible list formatting shared
by the enumerate package: inconsistent indentation.

The usual trouble of trying to change catcodes on the fly: Once an
argument is read, catcodes are locked and can't change, unless you go
via \scantokens or a temporary file (which is what \scantokens is only
much faster).

Take a look at the package underscore. Instructions in the package
file itself IIRC.

There is an alternative approach : use a tail-recursive
macro with a delimited parameter structure

	(say \foo #1_#2\sentinel)

The first delimiter is "_" with its new catcode, and
the macro expands to yield

	#1_#2

with the original catcode of "_".  Tail recursion
is needed to cope with further "_"s in #2.

Suggested to DEK at TUG's tenth anniversary meeting.

Subject: [texhax] My Headers Won't Stay the Same
Message-ID: <E1HeN6S-00061j-0G@garm.runbox.com>

I am quite new to LaTaX, and I decided to use it for a "Formal Lab" for my Biology class.  I had my headers all the way I wanted them to look like with my last name and "Biology B2" at the top right and the page number at the bottom center of the footer.  When I started adding more text to my introduction section and rational, I noticed that the DVI I created had changed the headers from what they were originally set to.  Instead of what I described above, it displays CONTENTS at the left and the page number at the right with nothing at the bottom.  Latter on in the document, when I start the Methods section, the headers and footers return to what they are supposed to be set to.

(I'm sure there is (being LaTeX), and I'm to lazy/ignorant to look really hard for an answer, ) but is there a way that I can keep the headers from changing so that they use the specified style?

The LaTeX source is attached (what I have done, and some random text to try and see what was /really/ happening).  I'm using Kile on GNU/Linux to create the document.  Any help would be appreciated.

Hi,

this header and document beginning should do the trick:

\usepackage{fancyhdr} \pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhf{} \fancyfoot{}
\fancyhead[R]{Biologie B2}
\fancyhead[L]{Last Name}
\fancyfoot[C]{\thepage}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt} \renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0pt}
\addtolength{\headheight}{0.5pt}
\addtolength{\textheight}{.15cm}

%opening
\title{Mendelian Genetics}
\author{Josh Rickmar}

\begin{document}
\begin{doublespace}
\pagestyle{fancy}
    \maketitle

    \setcounter{tocdepth}{2}
    \tableofcontents

    \newpage ....

With most Latex-Distributions comes the "Not So short Introduction to Latex"
lshort.pdf. There you'll find more informations.

Kind Regards,

Bert

Subject: [texhax] TFMs for Unicode (WAS Re:  Font help needed.)
In-Reply-To: <200704180032.l3I0WZk28696@f7.net>
References: <200704180032.l3I0WZk28696@f7.net>
Message-ID: <46280254.5090204@comcast.net>

Since some of the answers on this thread seem to connect with the 
problem of providing TFMs for Unicoded fonts, I would like to float the 
following proposed addition to the font naming scheme. 

It is going to be increasingly necessary to provide sets of TFMs to 
match large Unicoded sets of glyphs.  For this purpose we ought to 
borrow from Unicode organization and nomenclature.  When a TFM is 
created for one of the patgs above page U+00xx
let us simply say so, using the U (uppercase) and the hex page number 
(it might be even better if we could use U+01, etc. but including an 
arithmetic operator in a system-independent file-name is probably a bad 
idea.)  Unlike a lot of the gargantuan (and usually ephemeral) 
featuritis that presently afflicts font technology, Unicode font pages 
are not going to go away and, through the really brilliant coding of 
UTF8, they will be accessible to those of us who refuse to be dragooned 
into Vista for a long time to come.

If bchr designates the U+00 page of Bitstream Charter (I think it does, 
I don't happen to have used Charter recently) then bchr*U01 will always 
designate the Latin-1 set of glyphs and bchr*U03 will designate either 
COMBINING diacriticals (which will never be of much direct interest to 
TeX users owing to suboptimal spacing) or monotonic Greek or both.  
Pages like U+03 leave an irreducible chance of ambiguity but, in 
real-world usage it is unlikely to cause much trouble.  At the worst, 
some Unicode pages might have to be subdivided into slices (U030 vs U037 
for instance, or U03a vs U03b)

In an earlier message I showed how UTF8 could easily be read with a 
simple package of plain TeX macros.  The intermediate output of this 
package is one count register containing the page number, and one 
containing the glyph number on that page.
The page number register can easily be put to use to generate the 
appropriate TFM name by catenating it onto the old fontname No special 
memorization of fontname categories will be needed, and the glyph number 
will always be in the range 0--255.  

Even CJK can be handled this way.  The apparent size of a CJK repertory 
is daunting, but in the few cases when I have had to consider CJK 
setting, I have not been surprised to see that any real-world document 
other than a dictionary is likely to use a manageable subset of the 
whole range.  The plain TeX macros mentioned above do not require 
complete set, or even a continuous set of  "subunits" to extract the 
required Unicode pages.  Only the ones that correspond with the group of 
documents you happen to be setting need to be provided.. 

All of the above can be done with trip-tested TeX3.14195n, and it means 
that we can retain the full power of DEK's TFM and VF  programming 
unchanged.  I have the old-fashioned sense that that is really rather a 
virtue.

Subject: [texhax] Writing a Conference Program in LaTeX
Message-ID: <677ee07e0704191417u2cd998cdqa55db722a3d1dc99@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My high school's science research program runs a symposium, and I've
convinced the teachers to let me make the program in LaTeX.  I doubt it
would be to hard to start from scratch, but I would like to see some
previous conference programs in case there is anything I overlooked.  Does
anyone have any previous conference programs I could have?

Even if you haven't written a conference program before, you can probably
help me with one dilemma I've been having: Should I use the book class or
the article class?  The program will include some introductory information,
but most will be abstracts of all of the different presentations and
posters.

I shouldn't have made that remark, because now I will probably
have to wade back into Context only to find it was fixed long ago.

For the enumerate package...

Can you please elaborate? I use both the enumerate package and ConTeXt

There are many packages providing crop marks;
you find some of them by entering "crop" to some searching engine,
such as

     http://tug.ctan.org/search.html

(Sorry, this yields many "micropress" results.)

... moreover, a quick look at the manual of Peter Wilson's memoir class
makes me guess that memoir incorportates Melchior Franz' crop package
*and extends it*. memoir seems to be superiour to the Standard LaTeX
classes in a number of respects (at least when you write an English
document that won't be just a contribution to another editor's volume).
In particular, memoir saves you from asking some of those frequent
questions of type "Which package does ...?"

HTH -- Uwe.

It seems that the problem was to find a good keyword appropriate for a
search.

Phil & Phil (there is one Phil for plain TeX and one Phil for LaTeX on
this list:) mentioned the word "crop".

I think that, if you know what to search for, it makes most sense to
check the documentation provided by your TeX distribution first.  If
you are running teTeX or TeXLive on UNIX, you can say:

    texdoc -s crop

You'll get the documentation for the packages you are using.  If you ask
Google you are probably pointed to older versions.

If texdoc doesn't work for you (if you are on Widows) the best thing
you can do is to consult Robin's FAQ.

Thanks for the advice Donald!
Found that for example the direct use of \marginpar{(4)} left justifies and
vertically misaligns the number to the adjacent line and puts '(4)' on the
right margin by default(news to me). To place '(4)' on left  margin with the
right spacing and correct vertical alignment, this (from Ch3-'Basic
Formatting Tools' from <<The LaTeX Companion>>, 2nd edition Frank
Mittelbach, Michel Goossens, Johannes Braams, David Carlisle, Chris Rowley
ISBN 0-201-36299-6 available at
http://www.latex-project.org/guides/books.html; Thanks for making Ch 3
freely available; I need to invest in this book.) used the following (did
the trick for me):
\reversemarginpar
\newcommand\marginlabel[1]{\mbox{}\marginpar
    {\raggedright\hspace{0pt}#1}}
\marginlabel[(4)]

Vince

I'll try to answer this one, as I'm the author of
the package.  Dirk, which version of letterspacing.tex
are you using ?  I /think/ the most recent was V1.4,
and I'm reasonably sure it supported

	\letterspace to 1.3 \naturalwidth {G{\"o}del}

but I don't have access to the package as I write,
so I'll need to check and get back to you.

Yes, the following seems to work just fine :

It appears that TeXLIve is alive and well and has recently been 
updated. And the TeX community, including such luminaries as Han The 
Than, Taco Hoekwater, Hans Hagen etc. continue to develop their 
respective bits and pieces. It appears to me that the torch has been 
passed and TeXLive is now the canonical distribution. 

I am sure my betters will correct any mistakes in the above.

Dear TeX users,

- Software: the TeX Collection 2007 software was released some time
  ago, and physical DVDs and CDs are shipping to user group members now.
  Since there was no software release in 2006, the 2007 version will
  also be shipped to TUG members for 2006.
  http://tug.org/texcollection


- For anyone looking to head out on a last minute trip, there is no
  better place to go than EuroBachoTeX 2007, to be held in Bachotek,
  Poland, April 28 to May 2, 2007.
  http://www.gust.org.pl/conferences/EuroBachoTeX2007/


- TUG 2007 will be held in San Diego, California, July 17-20, 2007, on
  the campus of San Diego State University.
  http://tug.org/tug2007/
  
  It is not too late to submit presentation proposals, but please send
  titles/abstracts as soon as possible to tug2007 at tug.org.  More info
  about proposals at:
  http://tug.org/tug2007/cfp.html
  
  The web site also has a registration form, accommodation information,
  etc.  There is very inexpensive on-campus housing available, and
  several hotels close by.  Please register as soon as it's convenient,
  as it will help our planning considerably.
  https://www.tug.org/tug2007/register.html
  
  The first day of the conference will be devoted to tutorials.
  We expect to hold one all-day session on LaTeX, and two parallel
  sessions on a variety of topics, including MetaPost, beamer+tikz,
  ConTeXt, and LuaTeX.
  http://tug.org/tug2007/workshops.html

  See you in San Diego!


- New interviews in the Interview Corner for your reading pleasure:
  Jonathan Kew, the author of XeTeX; Will Robertson, a relatively new
  volunteer in the TeX community; and John Culleton, who runs an
  indexing and typesetting business using TeX.

This is correct, but let me add two things:

 1.  Before Thomas discontinued work on teTeX he made sure that
     everything he did went into the Web2c distribution from which
     teTeX and TeXLive are derived.  This means that teTeX is
     completely in TeXLive.

 2.  Some people think that TeXLive is too large.  But actually it is
     modular.  Werner Fink (from SuSE) recently created a module
     called "collection-tetex".  If you install this, you'll get a
     teTeX-like system.  On the other hand, if disk space is no
     problem, installing TeXLive completely has some advantages too.

Regards,
  Reinhard

The definitive  guide to all primitive TeX commands is _The TeXbook_ 
by Knuth.  The index indicates the primitives with an asterisk (*).  
the same book has all the plain TeX commands, some of which may have 
been migrated to LaTeX. 

For the LaTeX format I am less certain. You might have to look at the 
sources.  The Goosens book is probably the most definitive. 

I use the Kropka and Daly book.

The definite and most comprehensive guide is

Frank Mittelbach, Michel Goosens: The LaTeX Companion, Edition 2.
Addison Wesley, 2004, ISBN 0-201-36299-6.

Make sure you get the second edition.

Hello Richard,

    So who has or will be assuming the role?

Although no one has come forward to maintain tetex per se, the TeX Live
distribution is actively maintained (by me, among many others).  Several
GNU/Linux distributions have switched from using teTeX to TeX Live for
recent/upcoming releases, for precisely this reason.  TL has been around
for more than a decade now and is not going away.
http://tug.org/texlive

    Tex could go the route of troff+eqn+pic+tbl, the old AT&T Bell Labs
    typesetter from the 1970s.

1) My sense is that the TeX user community remains very large indeed, so
   I don't see any demise in the immediate future.

2) roff hasn't gone away either :).  GNU groff, a free software
   reimplementation (with many new features), is also actively
   maintained, by Werner Lemberg and others.
http://gnu.org/software/groff

Best,
Karl

... this problem is rather typical for this list. At the present instance,
TEDY (presumably) didn't know that what he had in mind is called
"crop marks" among publishing experts. Once upon some time ago,
I had molested this list by praising Scott Pakin's "Visual FAQ", cf.

     http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/visualfaq.html,

for this reason, where novices can look around for tasks they have in mind 
etc.

Moreover, when you are confronted with a certain problem for the first time
in your life, you hardly expect that your question is a frequently asked 
one ...

Cheers,

   Uwe.

Which shouldn't exist, since the license for the TeXbook prohibits  
typesetting it, except under certain narrowly defined circumstances,  
none of which allow the distribution of the resultant file.

If you want a copy of the _The TeXbook_, purchase it, or check it out  
of a library (or look at the raw code).

If you need a freely distributed Plain TeX tutorial, there're two,  
_TeX for the Impatient_ and A Gentle Introduction to TeX:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/impatient/

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/gentle/gentle.pdf

For more advanced reference there's Victor Eijkhout's _TeX by Topic_:

    torch has been passed

Just a point of clarification here.  TeX Live and teTeX happily
coexisted for many years.  TL has always been a superset of teTeX;
indeed, when Sebastian (Rahtz) first created TL, he firmly based it on
teTeX.  So it's not really a matter of a torch being passed, the torch
was always lit in both places (and many more besides).

It's true that teTeX has been the most visible incarnation of TeX to
most GNU/Linux users in recent years, since it came with virtually every
distribution, and now the distributions are (I gather) switching over to
TL, for the most part anyway.  So in that way there is a move toward TL.

But there are a lot of TeX users in the world, especially on other
platforms, who have never needed to use teTeX, perhaps have never even
heard of it, and have always happily used TeX Live, or some other TeX
distribution.  And that's fine too :).

Peace amongst multiplicity,
Karl

That is a compressed format, similar to zip. Since I don't use Windows 
I am unsure if my version of the same file will work. But I will send 
it to you in a separate email.

I think that you will find the package already installed in the basic
MikTeX package.
Look in the directory c:\Program Files\MikTeX 2.5\tex\latex\graphics
for graphics.sty.  If it is not installed you might consider
reinstalling MikTeX.  The installation of extra packages in MikTeX is
automated using Start | All Programs | MikTex 2.5 | Browse Packages.
You may install mising packages in this way if you have a connection
to the internet.  You can also update your installation using the
update icon available in the same set of shortcuts.  If you follow
these later procedures you will not have to do any additional
registration etc steps.

So, does that mean you don't actually have a proper MiKTeX installation?
Wouldn't it be easier just to install MiKTeX properly and have all the
benefits?

Hello all, I have two questions:

1 - How I can get rid of the page numbers of the apendices in the TOC?

2 - after I found the package pdfpages, I tried to insert some pdfs in
my last thesis report; It worked fine, but all the links (figures,
section etc) are pointing to (null).

this is the call of hyperref:

\usepackage[pdftex,

breaklinks=true,
colorlinks=false,

This is a well known problem.  Don't expert a solution in the near
future.  It's not trivial.  There are some nasty things in the Adobe
PDF specifications which make life much harder then necessary.

I really hope this problem will solved in the near future but I think
that we have to be patient.  Developers are involved in much more
important things at the moment.

Regards,
  Reinhard

All,

I'm putting together a bilingual study aid for a professional exam.  

I'd like to have a parallel presentation of the questions in English and Portuguese.  The multicols package seems right for guaranteeing local alignment, but the questions in each list should continue to be numbered consecutively and independently for each version of the test.

Is such a thing already out there?

Thanks.

Hi Kewal,
Since you're working in Windows you may want to consider getting <WinEdt>
(see http://www.winedt.com/). Its shareware (one time cost of ~$30-$70) but
works seamlessly with MiKTeX and its made my life really easy. Regards,

It is possible to do it using MetaPost, but it takes a lot of effort.  I
ended up writing my own macro package to do just this, and while the
output looks decent, the interface is anything but intuitive (even to
me, and I wrote the damn thing).  If I am ever able to come up with a
better and more useful set of front end macros, I would consider
uploading it to CTAN.



 anhnmncb> PPCHTeX? Seems I have to learn context, but I think
 anhnmncb> firstthing I must to learn is latex ...

The last time I looked, it was not easy to get ACS style drawings from
PPCHTeX, or I would have used it.

 anhnmncb> xymtex? Not a good choice.  

I agree.  Although the package is very powerful, it is not the type of
interface that I prefer.

 anhnmncb> Now I have to do it thru ``chemdraw -> export xxx.png ->
 anhnmncb> includegraphic{xxx.png}'' ...

This may be the easiest route, with a slight modification.  Of course,
the quality of drawings from ChemDraw is top notch and it is very easy
to match the style requirements of journals using it.  You may want to
look into installing a PostScript driver to export the ChemDraw figures
as postscript.  You can then convert this into an encapsulated
postscript (EPS) file using any of several freely available converters,
depending on your platform.  I run Debian Linux (Sid) and I use
`epstool' to do this.  If you have a lot of drawings it is easy to batch
the conversion.  The EPS files have the advantage over PNG that they are
vector graphic files rather than raster files.  This means that you can
zoom in on a graphic or enlarge it to an arbitrary extent without seeing
pixelation of the lines and text.  If you prefer to use pdflatex, you
may also convert the EPS files to PDF using epstopdf which I believe is
part of texlive.

Another option is to use ACDLabs ChemSketch which is free for individual
use and is about as powerful as ChemDraw for drawing 99% of the types of
figures used in chemistry journal articles.  It can also export to CDX.

There are several free chemical structure drawing programs as well such
as BKChem, XDrawChem, chemtool, gchempaint, jchempaint, etc.  They all
vary in the quality of their interface, the quality of their output, and
flexibility in achieving the styles needed for different journals.  My
main gripe with most of these programs is that they deal with atom
labels by placing white boxes behind the labels but in front of the
bonds.  This is done to make the bonds appear as if they terminate at
the label rather than being superimposed on it.  Most people will never
notice the difference, but me being who I am decided instead to make a
MetaPost macro package for control freaks.  This problem does not exist
in ChemDraw or ChemSketch, however.

Some other more latex-oriented possibilities include:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/streetex/

streetex is a very low level set of macros for creating chemical
structures using dvips specials.  I preferred this over xymtex because
of the greater degree of control it allows.  It is also fairly slow and
cumbersome to use, however, and requires frequent recompilations and
adjustments to get things just right.

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/ochem/

ochem also allows you to put the instructions for drawing the molecules
directly in your latex source.  It uses a perl script to extract the
information and create the eps files for inclusion.  From what I recall,
it was not too bad to work with and produced good results.

So depending on your wants and needs, you may want to experiment with
one or more of the above options to see what works best for you.

Good luck,

I find Context easier to learn than LaTeX :<). If you write to the 
Context list 

<ntg-context at ntg.nl>

you will receive answers from several people, including possibly Hans 
Hagen himself. Have you downloaded the PPCHTeX manual? 

There is also Metafun and its derivatives, the Context interface to 
Metapost.

The best freeware application for drawing chemical structures is without
doubt Isis/Draw ... it is an intelligent structure drawing package
available from MDL for a Windows environment.

But what's the problem with your current procedure using ChemDraw ?
OK you cannot edit a PNG graphic file, you have to go back to the
ChemDraw original ?  But trust me, a LaTeX picture approach is dreadful
by comparison ...

Subject: [texhax] section heading style conflicts with amsmath package
Message-ID: <46364AC6.4040301@ametsoc.org>

I'm having a problem with the formatting of unnumbered section headings 
when I add use of the amsmath package. 

When I use the \subsubsection* and \paragraph* commands I would 
correctly see the sections headings as:

FIRST UNNUMBERED TERTIARY HEADING

/First unnumbered quaternary heading/

However, when I add \usepackage{amsmath} to the beginning of my .tex 
file they are incorrectly formatted as:

3) *
First unnumbered tertiary heading
/(i) */
First unnumbered quaternary heading

I have defined subsubsection and paragraph in my .sty file as follows:

% subsubsection definitions
\renewcommand{\subsubsection}{%
\renewcommand{\@seccntformat}[1]{{\csname the##1\endcsname})~~}%1
\@startsection
{subsubsection}%
{3}  % 3 is the level for subsubsection
{5mm}% Indent subsubsections
{-\baselineskip}% skips 1 baseline after end of previous subsubsection
{0.5\baselineskip}% half baseline and the first paragraph starts
{\normalfont\normalsize\sc}
}
\renewcommand{\thesubsubsection}{\arabic{subsubsection}}

% paragraph (subsubsubsection) definitions
\renewcommand{\paragraph}{%
\renewcommand{\@seccntformat}[1]{({\csname the##1\endcsname})~~}%1
\@startsection
{paragraph}%
{4}  % 4 is the level for subsubsubsection (paragraph)
{5mm}% indent paragraph/subsubsubsections the same as subsubsections
{-\baselineskip}% skips 1 baseline after end of previous subsubsection
{0.5\baselineskip}% half baseline and the first paragraph starts
{\normalfont\normalsize\itshape}
}
\renewcommand{\theparagraph}{\roman{paragraph}}


Anyone have any idea why this is occurring? This does not occur when 
using \section* or \subsection*

Thanks,
Brian
