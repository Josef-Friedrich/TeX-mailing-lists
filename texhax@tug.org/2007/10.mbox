Subject: [texhax] Font Encoding Question
Message-ID: <554721DD-EA33-4979-88FC-07FD8884675B@bucknell.edu>

The following document produces two greater than signs that are  
*very* close to one another.  In fact, it looks like a single  
character.  If I comment out \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}, I get the  
output I expect.


\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\begin{document}
\texttt{>>}
\end{document}

Why does this happen?  Am I wrong to expect the output to be the same  
in both cases?  Most importantly, how do I get the output I expect  
while using the T1 encoding?

I guess the only way would be \texttt{>{}>}

I guess the T1 encoding defines the combination >> to be the
much-greater-than symbol.  I'm not sure at what level this happensbut the
obvious way to stop such behaviour is something like \texttt{>{}>}.

You should explain a litle more clearly what you mean by "picture". If you
mean you already have an eps, jpg, png or some other graphic file of the
picture you want to insert, then you should put \uspackage{graphics} in the
preamble and use
\includegraphics{myfile} where you want myfile.eps (or whatever) to appear.
Be aware that LaTeX only accepts ps or eps while pdfLaTeX accepts jpg, png,
pdf.

If you want to actually draw the picture using LaTeX, then you should
explain what sort of picture as there are many methods available.

Either that or \let\curpart\thepart

The \let is probably safer.

Insert some \show commanda to see what you are comparing,
like \show\curpart \show\curref

Message-ID: <1379030DC27828E1E01ABFE7@pleiades.unm.edu>

Dear TUG,

I am typing a paper that is written in the Polish language.  There are only 
a few characters that are considered "special" that I need to use as most 
of their alphabet is similar to our american/english language.  These 
characters are included in Table 9.1 on page 261 of the LaTex Companion 
(copyright 1994 version).  I am under the impression that I can access 
these special characters by using the command \symbol with the encoding 
scheme found in Table 9.1 but I am unable to figure out what codes to use 
in braces after the \symbol command.

The 3 characters (or international symbols) that I need are the "a" and "e" 
that both have a hook off the bottom of the letter that hooks to the right 
and the letter "l" with a slash through it.  The special "a" character is 
found in column A0, row 2; the "e" is in column A0, row 6; and the "l"  is 
in column A0, row A of Table 9.1.

Can you help me with interpreting how to access these symbols?  I am using 
a PC running Windows XP and using MikTex/WinEDT with version Latex 2e.

This may be another problem altogether, but I've also tried running the 
MikTex Update Wizard to update my software.  When the MikTex Update Wizard 
first pops up with the Update window, I click on Next, then select 
"Internet" for downloading the packages.  I get the error message "Cannot 
download the list of available package repositories: Not Found.  Any idea 
what is the problem or what I need to do to update my program?

Thanks! Susan

Could you be a little more specific?  Do you mean that the preceding text is
properly aligned and that when the references start they somehow run off the
right-hand side of the page?  Are you using any particular packages?  What
BibTeX style are you using?

Hm, if only I had a way of reading about this stuff. LaTeX is one
big mystery to me...

If I do that, I just get a runaway argument error. But I can use
standard "printf" debugging with \typeout, read on...

> >   \def\curref{#2}%
> 
> I'm not sure what you are giving as #2,...

\rrefx{section}{\ref{some-term}}{page~\pageref{some-term}}

So
  #1 section 
  #2 3.1.1
  #3 page~42

The theory is that I find out whether #2 matches the current
chapter, and the way to do that is basically:

  if #2 == \thechapter or ... or #2 == \thesubsubsection
  then
    print 'page~42'
  else
    print section~3.1.1
  fi

Now here is the function again, this time with \hbox{} (which Tom
originally included), which appears to be necessary as \ref{}
outputs it when it expands the reference:

\newcommand{\rrefx}[3]{%
  \protected at edef\curchapter{\thechapter\hbox{}}%
  \protected at edef\cursection{\thesection\hbox{}}%
  \protected at edef\cursubsection{\thesubsection\hbox{}}%
  \protected at edef\cursubsubsection{\thesubsubsection\hbox{}}%
  \protected at edef\curref{#2}%
  \def\refsame{#3}%
  \def\refother{#1~#2}%
  \ifx\curchapter\curref\refsame%
    \else\ifx\cursection\curref\refsame%
      \else\ifx\cursubsection\curref\refsame%
        \else\ifx\cursubsubsection\curref\refsame%
          \else\refother%
        \fi%
      \fi%
    \fi%
  \fi%
}%

And I finally got it working *iff* I disable the hyperref package.
If it's enabled, I guess \ref{} generates something else and the
match fails. In fact, typeout outputs:

  DEBUG: \ref {section:deb-term-nonfree}A\hbox {}A.2\hbox {}A.2.0\hbox {}A.2.0.0\hbox {}

so the \ref is substituted later, which breaks my approach. Am
I missing something? Is there anything I can do to fix it and make
it work with hyperref?

Open the figure in whatever viewer you use and print as postscript to a file
and then insert this figure in the usual way.  Or save it as, e.g,  jpg and
then use pdflatex.

You might also try reading the manuals that come with most latex
installations such as epslatex.pdf or grfguide.pdf (or see the FAQ linked
below).

They have to work, wherever \typeout would work.  The problem is
\typeout doesn't report the real definition because it expands.
You could do:
\typeput{\meaning\curref; \meaning\refpart}

NO!  #2 = \ref{some-term} !

Try \protected at edef\curref{#2}, but I suspect that gives differences from
the plain characters "3.1.1".

Yes, that's what I thought.  This also depends on the definition of \p at section
and others.

Try \edef\curref{#2}, which will expand \ref, but I suspect it
will give an error in expansion.

Probably you are missing a pre-existing package like "smartref".

I assume you mean \typeout instead of \typeput, then this is what
I get now:

  DEBUG: macro:->\protect \ref
  {section:deb-term-maintainer}macro:->3\hbox {}mac
  ro:->3.1\hbox {}macro:->3.1.0\hbox {}macro:->3.1.0.0\hbox {}

So I guess the \protect prevents the expansion? Is there a way I can
"unprotect" it in the \ifx statements?

Right.

> differences from the plain characters "3.1.1".

I tried that before and it makes no difference: with hyperref
loaded, it'll be \ref{...}, if I do not load hyperref, then it is
expanded and the whole thing works.

Yes:

  \@ifnextchar ... \reserved at d =#1\def \reserved at a {

Ah, I shall try that. However, what is a bit sad is:

  Note that the references create by smartref and byname are *not*
  hyperlink, when hyperref is active. Maybe in the future ...

Thanks for your input. Maybe I can get my simple approach working
somehow, and I'd appreciate any hints.

Below there is a TeX code and the PDF result is in the file attached.

S.R.

%===========================================================
%&pdfmex --translate-file=cp1250pl

\parindent 0pt
\parskip =9pt

Hi !

There are just 9 (nine) characters in polish alphabet
which are absent in Latin. These are:

\smallskip
\hbox to 3.3cm{a c e l n ? s z z}
\hbox to 3.3cm{A C E L N ? S Z Z}

I think, to get the beautiful polish charcters, one should use
the "polish" modifications of the original Knuth fonts:

\hbox to 5cm{ PLR instead of CMR \hss}
\hbox to 5cm{ PLBX instead of CMBX \hss}
\hbox to 5cm{ PLSS instead of CMSS etc.\hss}
\vskip-\parskip
or another fonts with polish characters.

Personally, I use PLAIN TeX and I make use of Live TeX package,
with predefined fonts with polish characters and "on\ the\ fly"
translation of my Windows CP-1250 characters (granted by --translate-file 
option)
just into internal TeX representation.

{\parskip0pt
With a non-polonized LaTeX, you probably have to

--- include polish fonts

--- define the macros getting chars from specific positions in font table, 
like
{\tt$\backslash$char"A6} (e) or {\tt$\backslash$char"AA} (l).
}

It is to say, the good polish typography requires not only these characters 
but also some other options:

{\parskip0pt
--- different "great or equal" and "less or equal" characters ( $\xleq$ 
$\xgeq$ and $\le$ $\ge$ )

--- different convention of quotation ( ,,Polish Name'' and "English Name" )

--- different convention of hyphenation

and probably some othe features.
}

I think Poland is not so exotic, as it seems to be sometimes.
There are many TeX users, and a strong TeX Users Group named "GUST"
(see www.gust.org.pl ).

Czesc, Stanislaw : your test file didn't make it
unscathed -- most of the diacritics are missing :-(

As regards \'{C|c|N|n|O|o|S|s|Z|z}, all of these
can be constructed using standard TeX acute accent;
is it the case, though, that in Polish typography
the accent is placed closer to the character than
in (say) French ?

Hi Phil,

I have to stress, the polish-specific characters are NOT the accented Latin 
characters;
these ARE different characters (nothing to do with accents) - even if some 
of them look like accented.
And polish typographs usually get furious (do you remember Jacko?) when 
someone tries to typeset polish texts using combinations of latin characters 
with accents, slashes and something instead of  "ogonek" (whatsit below 'a' 
or 'e').

Regarding to my TeX example, the idea was to provide a PDF file with all the 
"polish" characters and to show the source that does not use any backslashed 
constructs (to encourage using polish LaTeX); of course it can not be 
compiled successfully without
"%!tex --translate-file=cp1250pl ".

Cheers,

Stanislaw

PS. I have not seen you in Bachotek for years ...

Subject: [texhax] Inserting external links to URLs in LaTeX
Message-ID: <4703CCDD.8080203@xkl.com>

Hello!

I want to insert links to external web pages in a LaTeX document.  
Functioning links that actually work :-)  I found the url in the faq, 
which looks like it does what I want, but I didn't see any information 
about how to install it.  AND the documentation for it sounds incredibly 
complex.

1.   Is "url" what I want?

2.   Where do I go to install it?

3.    Is there a simpler way? 

Thanks as always!

Did you consider to use Jacko's fonts with a proper encoding?  Or do
you _have_ to use something else?

Then, for Susan or anyone else needing to typeset documents with  
extended Latin or non-Latin characters, XeTeX-XeLaTeX is really a  
very good option:

http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex

As long as you have a font (Postscript, TrueType or OpenType) with  
those characters in your system, you can use it for your TeX  
documents. And XeTeX is part of the TeXLive normal distribution, so  
chances are Susan already has it.

The mailing list is very helpful:

http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/xetex

Axel

I used the following that was suggested by Alex Retif (\k{a} \k{e} \l  with 
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} in the preamble) and it works great.  I was also 
able to use the suggestions provided by Stanislaw (\char"A6 or \char"AA) 
for a few of the fonts I needed and they work as well.

Not sure what you mean by "Jacko's fonts with proper encoding".  I'm a 
"simple" TeX user compared to what you fellows have been discussing.  :-)

Try:

\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage[QX]{fontenc}
\usepackage[cp1250]{inputenc}

As far as I know qx-encoding had been designed for Polish.
I'm not sure whether cp1250 is appropriate for Polish.

More info about Jacko's fonts (LatinModern) at:

   http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern

BTW,

 > \parindent 0pt
 > \parskip =9pt

it's better to \usepackage{parskip}

  Reinhard

Then you have redefined \show.  Don't do that!  Unless you know
commands are really not in use, stick with latex's \newcommand
to check for you.

$ grep -r '\\show' . || echo no, I have not.
no, I have not.

Maybe one of the packages I used, though..

Message-ID: <20071005145037.GA2976@lapse.madduck.net>

Hi there,

I am compiling a large document and wanted to make use of hyperref's
bookmarks such that in the resulting PDF document, the user could
display a table of contents. However, strangely, I get a warning
like

  Package hyperref Warning: The anchor of a bookmark and its parent's must not
  (hyperref)                be the same. Added a new anchor on input line 3.

for each section header, and the resulting bookmarks are all
descendants of each other:

  1. Introduction
     1.1. Scope
         1.2. Acknowledgements
             2. Literature review
                2.1. Debian
                     2.2. Diffusions

Any Idea what I am doing wrong? I could not find anything on the web
on this, so I turn here in the hope that someone may have mercy and
the answer. :)

I don't actually do that. After \maketitle and \tableofcontents,
there is a chapter with three sections, then a part with four
chapters, each with numerous sections, and so on.

You mean
http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/texmf-dist/tex/latex/oberdiek/bookmark.sty?view=log&pathrev=3989?

Well, after installing it and fulfilling all the dependencies,
I then get:

  ! Package bookmark Error: Unsupported driver `pdftex'.
  (bookmark)                Package loading is aborted.

  See the bookmark package documentation for explanation.

So that didn't work out...

Did you put bkm-pdftex.def somewhere where LaTeX can find it and 
update the package database?

Subject: [texhax] Fancy headers, parts and chapters
Message-ID: <001401c80921$67ddf7b0$4f01a8c0@biggus>

Hey,

I'm trying to get the name of the part of the book in the left hand
header and the name of the chapter in the right hand header. I'm using
fancyhdr but cannot work this out. 

I have dutifully read both the fancyhdr and all the usual documentation
but cannot find out anything much. In particular, LaTeX marks seem
little documented, I'm still not even sure what they are. What does
\markboth do, really?

If anyone can just provide the necessary lines to allow me to use
\leftmark and \rightmark in my definitions of the headers, I can
probably work most of it out myself from there, or some pointers on
LaTeX marks would help. Whatever is easier.

Kind regards,

James

P.S. Apologies for the last pointless post about fancy verbatims. In the
end I simply found the solution by reading the relevant documentation.
Sorry again.

Message-ID: <001501c80924$9fa03b10$4f01a8c0@biggus>

Hi all,

I thought I should give a more concrete example of the problems I'm
having, so... 

I want to show the text `PREFACE' and the page number in the header on
the preface pages. I've tried this:

+++

\chapter*{Preface}\markboth{PREFACE}{\thepage}

+++

I have loads of questions here:

* Why does it also work (I use the term losely) when I move the
\markboth inside the braces associated with \chapter?

* How do I echo the name of the chapter in the first argument of
\markboth, rather than `hardcoding' it?

* Of course using the \thepage command just results in the number 1
being shown on each page...

I understand that \leftmark and \rightmark merely echo the values of the
two arguments of \markboth here, but I'm unsure how to use \markboth
properly. 

The fancyhdr documentation suggests renewing the \sectionmark command to
set the \markboth command everytime the former is called, from \leftmark
or \rightmark, I understand, but I don't know the relationshiop between
these commands, so I can't make progress.

I hope this more concrete example makes it easier to offer assisstance.

Kind regards,

Jams

   I think you do want to use  
   the poemscol package, which has the \brokenline and \versephantom  
   commands for setting lines like these. This would be one line, as far  
   as the line counter is concerned, although it is divided among two  
   speakers. Poemscol works smoothly with dramatist, I understand.

So, this is what I had:

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{verse}
\usepackage{dramatist}
\pagestyle{plain}

and this is what I have now:

\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{poemscol}
\usepackage{dramatist}
\pagestyle{plain}

But I get:

ERROR: Undefined control sequence.

--- TeX said ---
<argument> \undefinedpagestyle

You need to include the geometry package in your preamble. Poemscol  
requires several other packages to work correctly. They are all  
listed on p. 5 of the manual. I think you can get by with just  
geometry and fancyhdr.

Use \markboth{title}{title} in the definition of \part, and
\markright{title} in the definition of \chapter.

\markboth declares the text to put in the header for both left-hand
(even numbered) pages and right-hand (odd numbered) pages.

Something of an FAQ.  Looking back, I believe something like this can help
("borrowed" from www.ichimusai.org/latex/):

You can avoid this by setting the following penalty values

\clubpenalty=9999
\widowpenalty=9999

This makes it rather hard for LaTeX to "break the rule" and typeset orphans
or widows. However it is still possible in some situations they will still
occur.

It is not recommendet to set this to 10000, bad things can happen then when
LaTeX can never break this rule.

Cheers, Phil

Hi,

I'm trying to do the following. I have an input macro that can be used to
store data in some toks register. The data could be:
\\ AAA \\ BBB \\ CCC \\ DDD
Now I want this data in a table. If I would write it out, I would write
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Col1 & Col2 \\
     & AAA \\
     & BBB \\
     & CCC \\
     & DDD
\end{tabular}

What I need is a macro that replaces in the contents of the register the
'\\' macro with '\\ &'. But whatever I try, I get problems. It seems that
I can't just define a macro that outputs the '&'.

Any ideas?

TIA,

Tim

You might be able to fix this by adding sufficient stretchability in  
the design to minimise this happening --- probably any design  
parameters which completely eliminated it would be unbearably ugly  
though.

To quote from _The TeXbook_:

Authors who insist on even spacing always,
with sightly divisions always,
do not clearly understand the rigidity of types.
\author T. L. ^{DE VINNE}, {\sl Correct Composition\/} (1901) % p138,  
p206

Typography is by its nature difficult --- computers make it much  
easier than it was in the past, but there are some things which by  
their nature require manual intervention.

A long while ago I wrote up a list of the manual adjustments I was  
making to books to the TYPO-L mailing list (back when I was  
wadams at atlis.com) --- you might find that useful.

Hi,

I'm a latex newbie and facing this problem for a very long time now.

I have a sub-section in a section of a chapter like this

\subsection{Tables}

in this section i have more than 20 talbes.

after that, i have another subsection

\subsection{SPs}

Now the problem is, latex is optimizing the page space in such a way that it
displays 5 tables first, then the text to subsection{SPs}, then a few more
tables, then text from the third subsection and then the rest of the tables.
I want my tables to be displayed the way they are in serial order. I mean,
everything should be displayed in serial order they way I written it in my
tex file.

Can anyone help me solving this problem ? Its bugging me for a very long
time.

Thanks in advance,

Jas

Subject: page layout (breaking) techniques
From: William Adams <[log in to unmask]>
Date: Tue, 26 Aug 2003 21:54:38 -0400

I posted this to a rather active discussion on comp.text.tex---for some
reason conversation came to an abrupt hault... I seem to recall having
done something similar in a discussion on comp.publish.prepres (or
maybe it was alt.publish.books... whatever)

Have I really learned all that is learnable on this subject? Do the
basic mechanics of page typography really devolve to so little (or is
it much?)

I ask because I'm currently working on a largish project which is now
critical enough it's starting to affect tempers other than my own here
at work, and if I could eke out even an iota's improvement, that'd be
very welcome.

Subject: page breaking techniques (was Re: License of TeX?)
Date: 23 Aug 2003 03:15:12 GMT

My take on this is that page breaks have to take into account an entire
chapter---if one is doing a book which opens on any page, well, I've on
occasion gone back and re-run a previous chapter to change the opener
of a chapter to tweak a figure placement early on, so ideally for such
books, one wants to consider the entire text.

Here's a description of the technique I'm using at work on my current
project:

   - style the entire chapter, setting the macros appropriately for
anything which doesn't match w/ what the author did. Fix overly wide,
or poorly hyphenated paragraphs at need.

---------------------- added text ----------------------------------
----this includes placing all graphics / figures as floats / in-line
----graphics
--------------------- end added text -------------------------------

   - flip backwards to the beginning, noting if anything is awkward - if
not, you're done (I think this has happened once for a previous project)

   - make notes on awkward pages and good pages / spreads, esp. noting
bad figure placement

   - from the beginning, adjust to get nice spreads w/ good figure
placement by strategically running spreads long / short (but only
adjusting one increment at a time, so a short spread doesn't back
a long or vice-versa), adjusting paragraph length w/ \looseness,
figure / table placement, creating figure pages at need,
space above heads and around tables and figures &c.

   - if one runs into an intractable problem, back up and try a  
different
set of long / short and other tweaks---possibly try running the entire
chapter long / short.

   - flip through making sure that no hyphenated words appear at the end
of a recto.

   - as a last resort, adjust leading on pages which can't be made to
come out any other way.

I think I've described this previously here, and asked if anyone could
suggest any improvements....

Anyone? Anything I forgot?

William

(who has been proselytizing to John Plaice that his multi-dimensional
approach to typography will provide a data structure to enable such a
page-breaking algorithm....)

I suppose I should enlarge upon this and write it up as an article

When I've had to do this sort of thing I've either done it by hand  
using Adobe Acrobat, or worked up a make file which post-processes  
the document (write out the page # where the A3 page will go, insert  
a blank to keep pagination correct, then read in the # and use a tool  
like pdftk to delete the place-holder page and insert the A3 page)

Alternately, if it's an electronic document, rotate it to landscape  
and fit it to the page, trusting the people who have access to large  
format printers will be able to use Acrobat's ``fit to page'' option  
to get a full-size printout.

From: William Adams <[log in to unmask]>

I posted this to a rather active discussion on comp.text.tex---for some
reason conversation came to an abrupt hault... I seem to recall having
done something similar in a discussion on comp.publish.prepres (or
maybe it was alt.publish.books... whatever)

Have I really learned all that is learnable on this subject? Do the
basic mechanics of page typography really devolve to so little (or is
it much?)

I ask because I'm currently working on a largish project which is now
critical enough it's starting to affect tempers other than my own here
at work, and if I could eke out even an iota's improvement, that'd be
very welcome.

Subject: page breaking techniques (was Re: License of TeX?)
Date: 23 Aug 2003 03:15:12 GMT

My take on this is that page breaks have to take into account an entire
chapter---if one is doing a book which opens on any page, well, I've on
occasion gone back and re-run a previous chapter to change the opener
of a chapter to tweak a figure placement early on, so ideally for such
books, one wants to consider the entire text.

Here's a description of the technique I'm using at work on my current
project:

   - style the entire chapter, setting the macros appropriately for
anything which doesn't match w/ what the author did. Fix overly wide,
or poorly hyphenated paragraphs at need.

---------------------- added text ----------------------------------
----this includes placing all graphics / figures as floats / in-line
----graphics
--------------------- end added text -------------------------------

   - flip backwards to the beginning, noting if anything is awkward - if
not, you're done (I think this has happened once for a previous project)

   - make notes on awkward pages and good pages / spreads, esp. noting
bad figure placement

   - from the beginning, adjust to get nice spreads w/ good figure
placement by strategically running spreads long / short (but only
adjusting one increment at a time, so a short spread doesn't back
a long or vice-versa), adjusting paragraph length w/ \looseness,
figure / table placement, creating figure pages at need,
space above heads and around tables and figures &c.

   - if one runs into an intractable problem, back up and try a  
different
set of long / short and other tweaks---possibly try running the entire
chapter long / short.

   - flip through making sure that no hyphenated words appear at the end
of a recto.

   - as a last resort, adjust leading on pages which can't be made to
come out any other way.

I think I've described this previously here, and asked if anyone could
suggest any improvements....

Anyone? Anything I forgot?

William

(who has been proselytizing to John Plaice that his multi-dimensional
approach to typography should provide a data structure to enable such a
page-breaking algorithm....)

I suppose I should enlarge upon this and write it up as an article

Message-ID: <EBD638F08A184FE482D61A88C49C9177@ComputerStopTwo>

I just got a new computer with the Vista operating system (thank you for your sympathies)  and was trying to load ghostscript and ghostview on it, in preparation for loading Tex.
1. At the Univ Wisc site and mirrors I saw no link to the gs***w32.exe file that installs ghostscript.  Is there a way to get that, and is it known to work with vista?

2. Is there good advice on a version of TeX that works with vista, and how to load/install it on the new computer?

Thanks

Is there a bibtex style that will output references in year order?
Typical requirement for publication lists for CVs etc.

 

I have tried using unsrnat style from the natbib package and asking
jabref to sort by year but the bib file is still sorted by author
(bibtexkey) ?! 

 

 

I would greatly appreciate some help.

As far as I know jabref sorts the bib file, but since BibTeX does its own
sorting this is a somewhat vain effort.  If you read the natbib manual
carefully, I'm sure it explains all about author-year sorting and will
suggest an appropriate BibTeX style file to use.

did you run LaTeX several times?

could you provide a full munimal example, i.e. a small file that we can 
use on our systems.

The situation you describe sounds quite odd. I for one would not recommend 
the use of

\chapter{xxx}
\include{chapxxx}

since \include forces a newpage

It's more complex and capable, but requires a lot of support files  
(fonts &c.).

Did you find MacTeX?

http://www.tug.org/mactex/

If download size is an issue, you could use the minimal distribution  
which Dick Koch has put together:

http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/

It's just three files:

http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop.dmg
http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/basictex.dmg
http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/BasicTeX.pdf

(and the last is documentation)

Oh yes, you should also look into LyX:

http://www.lyx.org/

which is an innovative front-end for LaTeX. More Mac OS X specifics  
for it here:

http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/LyXOnMac

Also, you may find xelatex a more comfortable latex version if you  
wish to use Unicode and different fonts:

That is \cite, not \citet, on line 403 of a file (possibly an .aux file).

Hi Donald, I appreciate your time in replying to me. I have still
not solved the problem and it's driving me insane!

I use natbib. Sorry for not thinking and including this from the
start.

> Fragile command in moving environment.  Use better packages or
> \protect.

I have no idea what this means. I checked out
  http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/teTeX/latex/latex2e-html/fragile.html
and my guess now is that a fragile command is used within the
bibliography, and it breaks as it's being moved into the main
document due to the cite.

But when I look at the two citations which cause trouble (all other
253 in my document work fine), I cannot find a command. I have tried
replacing the complex author string with John Doe, and I have
removed the braces around the D in Debian, but I always get the same
results.

I have moved the \cite around in the document, but no matter where
it occurs, the error still happens.

I have swapped other references into the same cite, and then the
error went away!

So it has to be something about the bibtex entries, which are:

@ARTICLE{AmorEtAl:2005:MLSUD3aaCSPR,
  author = {Juan-Jos? Amor-Iglesias and Jes?s M. Gonz?lez-Barahona and Gregorio
	Robles-Mart?nez and Israel Herr?iz-Tabernero},
  title = {Measuring Libre Software Using {D}ebian 3.1 (Sarge) as a Case Study:
	Preliminary Results},
  journal = {UPGRADE: the European Journal for the Informatics Professional},
  year = {2005},

}

I tried with citet and cite and I got the same problem in both. Then
again, natbib probably overrides it.

So I disabled natbib and replaced \citet/p with plain \cite, and of
course the problem went away.

I will file a bug against natbib about this, but I first have to
understand the issue.

I appreciate your help!

I doubt it.  It looks more like a redefinition of the \cite command
is fragile, and it breks when used in a figure caption or similar.
I am pretty sure, though, that natbib defines \cite to be robust.

You have to provide more context for where that error message 
comes from.  Check if it comes while loading an .aux file.  If
it does, then your testing was wasted; what you needed to do was 
delete the .aux files for every test.

Fragile definitions for special characters?

"\:" may be a fragile command but it usually is not (\mskip\medmuskip).

Package: texlive-latex-base
Version: 2007-12

Thank you Donald!

As I think the issue is solved, I am reporting this as a bug against
the Debian texlive-latex-base package. For more information:
http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2007-October/009150.html

I'd be surprised if it didn't, or if that hadn't been fixed yet.

> You have to provide more context for where that error message 
> comes from.  Check if it comes while loading an .aux file.  If

I made a minimal test case (attached). The problem disappears as
soon as I uncomment the utf8 stuff, but then the output isn't
proper.

So I tried *again* to remove the utf8 characters from the bibtex
entries, and this time I guess I got them all (and previously must
have forgotten one), and suddenly it works.

But this can't be, for I *surely* have used UTF8 in bibfiles before,
and this is not really the same as http://bugs.debian.org/382075
where the problem was that a ? character ended up being used as the
key for an entry.

I then went further and found that it works fine without natbib, but
natbib can't handle it, neither with tetex bibtex, nor texlive's
bibtex8. plain tex \cite works with both.

So this is a natbib bug, it seems.

Thanks for your time!

There the first byte from the UTF-8 representation of '?' was used in
the key, which triggered an error. With natbib the full author field
ends up in the key (see main.bbl), so this particular problem does not
happen. 
 
> So this is a natbib bug, it seems.

It might also be a problem with ucs.sty's implementation of UTF-8. At
least your sample document works for me if I use the UTF-8
implementation from inputenc, ie

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

instead of

\usepackage{ucs}
\usepackage{inputenc}
\inputencoding{utf8x}

I wasn't aware of this, but to be honest, I'd rather *not* use it.
Latex diacritics are a pain to read. It's 2007. I should not have to
be jumping through hoops.

I can confirm this. Let me try to figure out why I wanted to use
ucs...

So this is starting to look like a bug in
ucs.sty/texlive-latex-recommended then?

The bug is there if I use ucs.sty and it goes away when I switch
from utf8x inputenc to utf8 and remove ucs.sty, or when i leave
ucs.sty in and use utf8,utf8x as argument to the inputenc package.

This is my logic...

And...

You don't use .exe's on Macs. They are used on Windows based PCs.

I would suggest you get a copy of the TeXLive disk image from http:// 
www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html From there it is very easy to install.

I guess here is a small misunderstanding, the ucs.sty is contained in
the TeX Live collection "collection-latexrecommend", which transfers
into a Debian package "texlive-latex-recommended".

I don't know how ucs.sty ended up there, the decision on what is
"recommended" and what "extra" is quite difficult to carry out. If you
think that it is completely wrong please let us know on
	tex-live at tug.org
(Cc-ed).

Thanks a lot and all the best

Hi all,

I'd like to typeset an \equiv sign with a vertical bar (|) through the

Hi Norbert

It is indeed a TeXlive recommendation and it is not clear where they
get their advice from.

Our problem is that so closely connecting latex and recommended
suggests this may be our classification.

This does not imply that we think that ucs.sty is wrongly classified;
merely that the Project Team does not necessarily have any input into
this -latex-recommended list.

Hello,

A workaround for non-intensive use could be like:

\def\barequiv{\hbox{\setbox0=\hbox{ $\equiv$ }\setbox1=\hbox 
to\wd0{\hss$|$\hss}\wd0=0pt\box0\box1}}

$$ Aa \equiv aA $$
$$ Aa \barequiv aA $$

but it is not a definition of "mathematical" element - it does not do a 
proper spacing in math mode.
Probably 'mathchardef' should be engaged for more general solution (?).

Stanislaw Romanski

Subject: [texhax] import image problem--where to save the file?
Message-ID: <4712B1CE.6020604@merton.ox.ac.uk>

Hi!

I am a first-time novice to LaTeX, and here is my first major problem...

I am trying to include a .esp image in my document but I don't know 
where to save the file so that LaTeX will be able to use it. I am 
running MikTeX on WinXP and tried to import the image using the Graphicx 
package's command /includegraphics{}. The image file is currently on the 
'My document' folder, and in each compile run I get the message ''File 
'img1' not found''. This sounds like a very stupid question, but I've 
tried saving the file on several different locations (including some in 
the MikTeX directories) and its still not working out.

Please help!

Thanks a lot!

Denny

    it is not clear where they get their advice from.

Sebastian decided as best he could, many years ago.  Very little has
changed in the set of "recommended" TL packages for a long time now.


Anyway, the main point here is not the classification of ucs, but rather
the possible bug in it.  I see on
http://www.unruh.de/DniQ/latex/unicode/ that Dominique Unruh is no
longer able to maintain the unicode package (which contains ucs.sty),
and a new maintainer is welcome.

Perhaps someone here would like to take it on ...

Best,
Karl

if it's an Encapsulated PostScript file, the extension should be .eps
and not .esp.

You certainly mean \includegraphics{}.  I strongly recommend to make
use of the copy&paste facilities provided by your OS instead of typing
everything manually. 

 > The image file is currently on the 'My document' folder, and in

The proper place is the directory where the main .tex file (the file
which contains the \documentclass command) resides .

  Reinhard

Hello,
I was trying to make a tree like this

               section
                     subsection 1
                     subsection 2

                                 subsubsection 2

For subsubsection, I used the following:

            \subsubsection{subsubsection heading}
            \label {label}

However, I don't get what I desire. Is there anything else I need to do here
?

Thanks,

At that time ucs.sty was probably the only way to use UTF-8 encoded
text for LaTeX. Nowadays inputenc.sty includes UTF-8 capabilities that
handles many cases, so that ucs.sty is more for special cases, ie more
"extra" than "recommended".

I am not sure, but the time to do this might be better spend extending
the Unicode-coverage of the UTF-8 implementation in inputenc.sty.
AFAIK that's the area where ucs.sty is still better than inputenc.sty.

That would be true as utf8 in inputenc was deliberately limited to
characters that were clearly intended for use with the standard LaTeX
8-bit font encodings.

Just to include some characters is not the whole story, you know. Especially
for (good) typesetting. 

>From the XeTeX FAQ:

XeTeX reads all input files as Unicode text. However, the standard 
hyphenation files for many languages use encodings such as the 
TeX-Latin1 (Cork) encoding or various others. Such files, if they 
include literal characters in the range above 127, will 
almost certainly cause XeTeX to fail, with an "invalid character" error.

No. That would be a major undertaking which I have not
the resources or interest to undertake, I am afraid.

Try looking at one of the table enhancement packages, such as tabularx.

Ok, so I should have polished my crystal ball a little better.  I guess that
by "tree" you really mean a "table of contents", right?  That is, what you
get with  the \tableofcontents command.  I guess this because \subsubsection
is defined in most classes and so should get what you want as a heading to
the subsubsection itself.  If not, then you should also tell us what class
you're using.

The depth of listing in the table of contents is determined by the
"tocdepth" counter; so \setcounter{tocdepth}{3} in your preamble should do
the trick.  Although these are already the defaults for the "article" class,
for example.

Incidentally, if you want subsubsections numbered, you may also need
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}. Again though, this ought to be the default.

The depth code numbering is as follows:

part 		-1
chapter 		 0
section 		 1
subsection 	 2
subsubsection 	 3
paragraph 	 4
subparagraph 	 5

Cheers,  Phil

There are some engines which support Unicode somehow (XeTeX, Omega,
LuaTeX).  Had any decisions been made on which engine LaTeX3 will
depend?

I don't care what a future version of LaTeX will depend on; I just
want to know when LaTeX will work with the unicode capable engines we
have now (XeTeX) and will have soon (luaTeX).

Subject: [texhax] curriculum vitae: question about prefix in Curve package
Message-ID: <47145E98.1040202@binghamton.edu>

Using MikTex on Windows XP.

I'm looking at a number of packages for writing CV in LaTeX.  Most seem
a little outdated, but Curve seems most useful for my needs.

Curve defaults to placing a \textbullet prefix before each entry.  I'd
like to omit that for some entries.  The documentation makes reference
to a \prefix macro, by which the prefix symbol can be changed.  But I
can't figure out how to use it.  Does anyone have experience with this,
and can advise me how to omit the prefix symbol?

Alternatively, any better LaTeX tools for creating CVs?

Thanks.

Well, reading the manual, I would guess that \prefix{\textbullet} puts a
bullet and \prefix{} would put nothing.

Sorry, I roll my own.

I've been testing the upcoming release of the Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol
List against the latest TeX Live.  Along the way I've been fixing package
incompatibilities such as the ones you reported.

The source of the problem is generally that a newer version of some package
introduces a symbol that (a) didn't exist in the previous version and (b)
conflicts with a symbol from a different package.

You may want to look at moderncv which is another package for writing a CV.

Do you have a more precise spec for 'will work with'?

I was under the impression that SPQR and many others are happy that it
does so work, possibly with an extra package loaded?

    \usepackage{array}

      \begin{tabular}{>{\centering}p{24mm}
                      >{\centering}p{24mm}

        def & ghi & jkl\\
      \end{tabular}

easier to work with? THen one does not have to use special commands to 
change rows. \arraybackslash is only needed in the last column and only if 
one has done something that changes \\ (such as \centering).

\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}

It has a reasonable amount of precision but the latin1 case looks like
backward compatibility and it is not clear to me why it does not work
in that sense.

Maybe what is required is a xetex-inputenc package or packages rather
than extending the current 8-bit technology into the new world.

Does anyone else have a feel for this?

Thanks,

Dear all,
 
I am using the hyperref package in my document, and want to open a (.pdf)
document located in my desktop instead of a web URL address. 
 
I can write : \url{file:///C:/myfile.pdf} and it works. However, I would
like to use the command \href{my link}{my text} for my purposes (this is
nicer). In this case, the command does not activate the link (it doesn't
recognize the extension of the file). How can I achieve that ?
 
Thanks for your help,

Yes indeed! Forgot that "\arraybackslash" is now available in the "array" 
package. It was a part of the "tabularx" package originally, wasn't it?

Note that I constructed the figure from scratch using microsoft visio. Then I copied the figure and paste it into Adobe photoshop. Then, from adobe photoshop I saved picture as .eps file.
Thanks.

There are lots of things you can do, like reading one of the manuals
(grfguide.pdf for example).

Anyway, here's a selection of suggestions:

1. Instead of  dvi2pdf  try  dvi2ps + ps2pdf.

2. Set up a printer to create a postscript file and then from visio (I
assume you can) create a ps of your figure directly.

3. If, instead, you can create all you figures in, say, jpg (or even pdf -
e.g. with pdfCreator) then you can use pdflatex to generate the pdf
directly.

Cheers,  Phil

Acrobat Reader has a View->Rotate View->[Clockwise/Counterclockwise] 
toolbar command i'd like to activate upon opening w/ a hyperref command,

suggests that this is a "PDF-specific display option".  rotation is 
mentioned in the 'form specific' options.

i conclude that hyperref doesn't have such an option - am i correct?  i 
admit to having an older version, but i read through the latest package

The smple answer is "yes".  How much depends on the complexity on exactly
what you're doing and how easy it is to prepare input files that may be used
equally in a book and an article.

> Do you
> have a template to share, or offer specific guidelines for achieving

No. Just use \include{filename} as much as possible (instead of \input), but
beware: you cannot nest includes.  Then in your preamble
\includeonly{file1,file2,...} will allow selective compiling, which can
speed things up if you're writing a large book, say.

Cheers,  Phil

P.S.  The various manuals available do explain most of this pretty clearly.

the project. I have learned an awful lot about LaTeX in this time and still
feel I've only scratched the surface of this enormous subject. Normally I like
to work things out for myself and *learn*, but lately I've been hitting a few
problems that seem beyond me and could really do with a bit of guidance.

The text is on signal processing and it contains a lot of small diagrams. Some
are very small indeed, which I actualy include inline mixed into the text. Others
occupy 2 or three lines and are about 1/4 pagewidth. So this is not a typical
book layout where floats are broken away from pararaphs and centered, there would
simply be to much whitespace this way. What I am aiming for is more like a single
column magazine style.

I have employed a number of techniques such as wrapfig and sidecap, tweaked
the whitespace around captions, used the caption package to get more compact
layouts and so forth.

So, rather than enumerate all the little annoying problems here may I ask
a few more general questions: 

What suggestions or pointers to example code might you share for 

1) Very dense layout with inset figures and text flowing around it
2) Advanced tips for moving floats around 
3) Any postscript tips/utils for brutally cropping .eps files (sorry this
isn't strictly a TeX question but I'm sure many here understand this issue)

Many thanks and good wishes to all,

Andy Farnell

Thankyou very much for reply Martin,

I am using Postscript because an application I am documenting
outputs in this format. Actually these are plain .ps files not
.eps, but they seem to work with /includegraphics just fine.

To clarify, the problem is that I had to manually print out each
figure, which meant carefully placing a frame around it and then
hitting "print". I had to do hundreds of these, so not all are
perfect - some have a bounding box one or two points bigger than 
they should be.

What I would like to do is batch autocrop the lot of them, so that 
the bounding box is *exactly* shrunk to the extent of the image.

Is that possible? I have a little awk script that makes font 
adjustments already, and I thought I could tweak it to work out
the top, bottom, right and leftmost lines and then shrink the
bounding box accordingly. Turns out not to be so easy, mainly 
because my knowledge of Postcript is poor and I'm really just
hacking. 

I guessed this wheel has been invented?

Doing this by hand would be weeks of work.

thanks,

Andy

Subject: [texhax] Minimizing the Minimalist Scheme
Message-ID: <30160163.1192839330164.JavaMail.root@web15>

Near the beginning of this year I downloaded TexLive & installed
a LaTex "minimal scheme" on my Slackware Linux box. I only added
packages for Times & Helvetica that I use exclusively. Everything
functions absolutely perfectly!

However, I have discovered that of order 80% of the disk space is
consumed by Knuth's CM fonts ... & I never use these.

Now, I am a minimalist ... to an extreme!

So, my question to you is this. How can I perform an installation
that completely excludes these fonts? In perusing the directory
structure I found references to CM fonts scattered all over the
place so a simple delete will not work.

Thank you for your assistance.

Yes but unsuccessfully for a few reasons

1) I couldn't seem to find a2ping with apt-cache search, perhaps
it's part of a utilities package under another name.

2) I'm not entirely sure of the meaning of the ghostscript command
which just seems to print the bounding box dimensions in the console.

3) Neither am I really sure when it's working :) The discrepencies are very
small and by trying it on one of them it's rather hard to see whether it
has any effect. Only when you have a line of them do you see they are
irregular - if that makes sense. I'm experimenting with "draft" option
to \includegraphics to see if I can get the bounding boxes to be clearer
to me.

4) My backup plan to use \raisebox seems to work and I can now tweak 
them up and down.

Thanks for your help and any further suggestions Martin. I'll battle on
but will surely be back. At some point I suppose I'd better post up some
code because surely it's difficult to visualise what I'm doing.

cheers,

Andy

Thankyou Tom. I'll give that one a try tomorrow.

A way of testing this just occured to me, I'll make some
ones with deliberately very bad bounding boxes and see
which method fixes things best :)

when you use such small diagrams, the standard BoundingBox within the
the graphics file often isn't precise enough (rounded to 1/72 in), hope
you already know that HiResBoundingBox should be used instead. It needs
to be there in the diagram file, and LaTeX needs to be setup by adding
the "hiresbbox" package option to includegraphicx. Similar setup for
your converter programs. And check that your viewer uses the
HiResBoundingBox when you look to the individual diagrams.

I use picins often instead of wrapfig. Picins works within list
environments, for example, though not perfectly (I can supply my
previous postings on the subject). The author of picins is not traceable
(I've tried hard).

> 2) Advanced tips for moving floats around

This is mostly an FAQ and google exercise to adjust the various
textfractions, etc. for your purpose. But I'll take the opportunity to
ask if there are any plans by anyone to make the multicolumn package
work with floats. That would be very nice, though even without being a
package-writer and knowing nothing about tex output routines (other than
that they exist) I can see the mess that might be involved.

I use pdfcrop, which I've found to be an excellent command-line utility
that almost always gives me the tighest possible bounding box. If you
can generate the figures directly as pdf's, do so and pdfcrop them.
Otherwise, use epstopdf to turn them into pdfs, which often yields a
pretty good bounding box anyway, and pdf-crop them. Then, of course, use
pdflatex.

    Now, I am a minimalist ... to an extreme!

I guess so!

    How can I perform an installation
    that completely excludes these fonts?

As things stand, you'd have to change the way the LaTeX .fmt is created
by default -- standard LaTeX (and plain too) requires the tfm files for
the CM fonts.  You'd be creating your own custom format.

Also, you better not ever use math, since even with "Times & Helvetica"<
I bet some symbols are coming from the CM math fonts.  Even some text
symbols come from there, under some circumstances.

    structure I found references to CM fonts scattered all over the
    place so a simple delete will not work.

Having built the .fmt file, you could (re)move the fonts.

I expect most of the disk space is consumed with the pfb files; if you
truly never use the fonts, you could remove those and be no worse off.

Good luck.

Before I move on to some of the other suggestions given I want to
try and give \wrapfig some more effort first. The problem is that
it refuses to put my figures *here*. According to Google searches:

"Note that the wrapfigure environment is in fact non-floating."

But it's still throwing figures all over the place, sometimes onto
a different page. Typically I want three small wrapped figures per
page.

I have \usepackage{here} but \wrapfig doesn't seem to understand !h 
as an argument.

The command I defined is given below.

% 1/3 width Wrapped figure
%(psfile, caption, label, scale, lines, wstrim1, wstrim2, wstrim3)
\newcommand{\wrapgrafthird}[8]{
\begin{wrapfigure}[#5]{o}{0.3\textwidth} %outside edge, 1/3 width
    \centering
    \vspace{#6}
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth,angle=0,  scale=#4]{#1}
    \vspace{#7}
  \captionsetup{margin=14pt, font=footnotesize, labelfont=bf}
  \caption{#2}
  \vspace{#8}
  \label{#3}
\end{wrapfigure} 
}

And then using it thus:

\wrapgrafthird{images/puredata/subpatches/subpatch-squared}%
{$x^2$ subpatch}{fig::squaredsubpatch}{0.75}{6}{-10pt}{-8pt}{0pt}%


Thanks for any clues.
Cheers,
Andy

What kind of thing causes a "collision" and how might I avoid it?

Okay. Sorry for the constant updates. Think of this as Andys TeX blog :)

I have now discovered that \wrapfig can't be used in this case. The other
tiny inline graphics are clashing with it and melting its brain. 

With \usepackage[verbose]{wrapfig} and reading the .sty source notes I learned
much more. It seems "A rare problem is that floats and footnotes specified 
within the wrapping text can also cause poor placement and bad formatting."

I will take the advice, also given elsewhere by Piet van Oostrum to go with
\parpic... wish me luck.

Andy

Yes.  It is called the output routine for LaTeX 3.

I don't believe it though.  

I remember having TeX, editor, and documents on one 300k floppy;
the cm fonts (pk) and dvi viewer on a second 300k floppy.

pfb for latin modern etc, or pk for em (rather than cm).

Another wrapfigure.  

It can't make complex paragraph shapes with several cut-outs.

It can't place a non-floating wrapfig here if there is a 
floating one pending.

Using scrlttr2 from koma-scriipt I'm creating a personalised letter layout

Therefore I used the option DIN positioning the address of the addressee on

I instead would like to position the date - according to the Italian style - 
on the top right side, say a couple of cm under the top margin of the sheet.

How can I obtain this result?

Two possibilities are xfig and pstricks.  I'm working on a paper and
using xfig for the geometry diagrams - it's nice because it is
extremely precise, with a grid system and editing.  One can export the
results as an eps that works just fine in LaTeX.  Pstricks can be used
directly in LaTeX and it's quite powerful.  Of course you have to
build the entire figure in either of these systems.  (To find them,
just google for xfig and pstricks.)

Also the pgf/tikz graphics package which David Romano mentioned just the other
day looks very powerful and in some cases has some slightly easier syntax 
than pstricks.

I have been trying since last night to install this font. Every bit of 
advice I get on the web is somehow dated and doesn't help me. I know I 
need to create font metrics files from for Latex to use, as well as 
another type of font for the PDF driver to use. Since I have created the 
font myself, I can create any type of font I want--type 1 or true type. 
 From there, I am lost. All the advice has led me nowhere.

Am running pdfetex, version pi.

Hi Eric,

You should have a look at TikZ/pgf, especially
in collaboration with this one:

In addition, pgf/TikZ will work with pdftex so you are not
forced to produce a postscript output.  Section 1.2 of the
pgf/TikZ manual is called "Comparison with other graphics
packages" and you can learn more there.

On the other hand with a gui it is always one click, with

On Windows, I wrote a command called figtex.cmd, the relevant parts of
which follow:

for %%i in (%*) do (
	epstool --copy --bbox %%~ni.ps %%~ni.eps
	epstopdf %%~ni.eps
)

The %%~ni stuff extracts the filename (without the extension) from
each file on the command line.

how can i force latex to place a graphic (figure in a pdf file) exactly in a
given position, before the text continues ?

with the command
\begin{figure*}[h]
\includegraphics{myfigure.pdf}
\end[figure*}

written text.

it can happens that "written text" is displayed before teh figure, who is
displayed in the next page.
I want the figure exactly before "written text", even when a pagebreak
occurs.

If the figure is splitted on two pages it is ok or even better...

The figure should not be numbered (figure*).

Simply use \includegraphics. You do not need it to float, so why make it a float?

Hi!

I'm writting a document (document class scrbook, twoside) and I would like to:
1. get the page of the title with a different color
2. include a picture on that page.

For 1. I've tried
     \pagecolor{color}
     \maketitle
     \pagecolor{white}
but I get *two* pages colored (the front and the back, pages 1 and 2).

For 2. I've tried
     \includegraphics{picture}
     \maketitle
(the picture appears on page 2, the back of the first sheet).
and also
     \maketitle
     \includegraphics{picture}
(the piture is inserted on page 3 only)
Since I want only the picture to appear in the first page, I even tried
     \title{\includegraphics{picture}}
     \maketitle
but the picture goes to page 3.

Can someone give me a hint?
Thank you very much,
Nat?rcia

Since the title page is created by the \maketitle command you need to  
look into how it's defined and either hook into that (for some  
document classes hooks are provided) or redefine it, or make an end- 
run around it (usually it uses pagestyle{empty} so re-defining how  
that appears will work if not needed elsewhere).

The relevant FAQ page is this:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=titlsty

which suggests the titling package and includes a link to:

TeX?! Overly helpful?!  ... Not!

Where are you getting hyphenation? 

* in ToC only 

* or in the body of your output


I am guessing that you may be using twocolumn in your options.

1. figure out how to have the ToC in just one column

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\tableofcontents

\newpage

\twocolumn

2. reduce size

\begin{small}

\tableofcontents

\end{small}

3. use \raggedright which will require that you modify the section
headings command(s), a non-trivial task

Hi,

Thanks for the advice.

Basically some words are being hyphenated in the chapter and section  
headings and the ToC.

I'm writing my PhD thesis so have the below, so everything is in one  
column.

\documentclass[12pt, oneside]{report}

I would like to stop getting hyphenated words in the chapter/section/ 
subsection headings because it doesn't look to good.  As far as I can  
tell I haven't adjusted the default chapter heading settings.

Can you supply some more information on how to do no. 3 " use  
\raggedright which will require that you modify the section headings  
command(s), a non-trivial task"

Thanks
Suzanna

the variable you want is \@title

Here is some code I use to get my title into my .pdf descriptions:

my papers use the class file: sugconf.cls
which is where the variables SUG* come from

\makeatletter%necessary to copy title and author into pdf description
\usepackage[bookmarks   =false%SUGI style guide
           ,pdfauthor   ={\@author}%
           ,pdfcreator  ={pdfLaTeX sugconf.cls}%
           ,pdfkeywords ={\SUGconfKeywords}%
           ,pdfstartview=FitBH%fit width of page to the window
           ,pdfsubject  ={\SUGconfSubject}%
           ,pdftitle    ={\@title}%
]{hyperref}\makeatother\begin{document}%

so:

\makeatletter
\fancyhead[LO, RE]{\@title}
\makeatother

as you might have noticed article deletes the title data after \maketitle, 
the usual workaround is

\newcommand\mytitle{some text}

\title{\mytitle}

\fancyhead[...]{\mytitle}

Ideas:
- use \mbox to disable single hyphenation points
- use the optional argument of sectioning commands to disable
hyphenation in the toc
- if you use babel (untested):
\begin{hypenrules}{nohyphenation}
\tableofcontents
\end{hyphenrules}
  see the LaTeX companion 2nd ed., p.545
- use koma-script, which does ragged sections automatically (and is
much better then the standard classes)

I had a lot of success with adjusting the hyphen penalty
globally. There are other side effects (which I don't
fully understand yet), but the effect is what I wanted.

Try adding

\hyphenpenalty=5000

at the start of the document.

Hi

Thanks for the suggestions.

I found

\hyphenpenalty=10000

got rid of the problems in the section headings, but then caused  
hyphens in the main text to not break, causing some long words to  
extend into the right margin.

I have found a solution (I think)

\begin{flushleft}
\section{heading}
\end{flushleft}

This seems to work, but is quite manual but will do to start with.


Thanks for all your help.
Suzanna

Or, very simply,

\lefthyphenmin=1000  %   to disable all hyphenation in words less than 
1002 letters long,
You can then reenable hyphenation by returning to \lefthyphenmin=2, (or 
whatever was current for the
specific language you were using---if you don't know, try 
\showthe\lefthyphenmin).

Sounds like both.  And LaTeX's standard document classes are designed 
to allow (and even require) hyphenation in both.

The answer is to use a better documentclass than the demonstration versions
that are packed with latex.  I suggest memoir or scr*.

It is so incredibly bad to format section titles with big fonts and
flush margins, that one can speculate that it is *intentionally* bad,
to encourage people to customize their documents.

Section titles should *always* be ragged (right or center).

NO!!!!!  

Even if you set it locally, as part of the (your) document-class definition
of \section, that still leaves big gaps between the words.  Use \raggedright
in the "fonts" argument of \@startsection in the (your) documentclass; or use
a sane customizable documentclass or a package like titlesec.

(please don't leave a full reversed archive of the correspondence at the bottom
of every message.)

Yikes! I did that too and I'm sure it's caused some weird side effects.

You mention Memoir class in your other post. This looks like a beautiful
book class which I intended to use, but it seemed to clash with some other
packages that are vital to my text like "algorithm" and some other code
listing packages. I didn't understand enough LaTeX to resolve these problems.
Do you think it's possible to fix those issues and upgrade to Memoir at
some later point? (Not a massive priority for me at the moment).

Thanks,

Andy

I have two questions:

1- How can I push the text from a point forward, to the top of the
next column in a two columns document? One example is when you want to
push the title of a poem (and the text that follows) to the next
column as opposed to leaving it hanging under the previous one.

2- How can I prevent columns from spreading evenly in  two,  and force
it instead to fill the first column first?   Thanks.

Never play with penalties unless you are convinced you understand how 
they work.  It is all laid out in the TeXbook, but it is not a simple 
matter, and penalties interact with one another.  Simple, one-off 
changes, like the ones associated with Plain TeX \break, are OK, and all 
the more so when it is Don Knuth who set them up, but otherwise, a 
general policy of hands off for penalties is a good idea. 

\lefthyphenmin=1000 is a simple, transparent integer.  It does not 
interact with anything but the hyphenation pass, and it simply makes it 
impossible to hyphenate any word imaginable.  It is not originally my 
idea, and I wish I could remember the name of the unsung genius who 
thought of it.

Subject: [texhax] Jurabib, Multibib and \nobibliography
Message-ID: <200710231617.25666.tug@wiseguysweb.com>

I'm trying to use the jurabib and multibib packages together.  At the end of 
the document that I'm producing, I want the references for the multibib 
bibliographies (books.bib, letters.bib) to be printed.  However, I do not 
want the references listed at the end of the document from the normal 
bibliography (footnotes.bib) that jurabib uses.

If I specify the jurabib bibliography with \bibliography{footnotes}, I get all 
three references (books, letters, and footnotes) listed.  If I specify the 
jurabib bibliography with \nobibliography{footnotes}, then the references 
section for the footnotes bibliography is not printed (what I want); however, 
the books and letters bibliographies only show the titles of the 
bibliographies and no references (I want the references to show as well).

The code listed below --- it's a modified jbtestmb.tex sample code that is 
included with the jurabib package.

Any thoughts on how to get the multibib references to show and the jurabib 
references not to show?

Subject: [texhax] Changing the font: "Contents" and chapter headings
Message-ID: <6FD11878-42FA-4DB0-BEAA-367A7BDD15CE@shef.ac.uk>

Hi,

I'm trying to change the font of the word "Contents", above the table  
of contents. I would like it to be bold, sffamily, but without  
changing it's position, which was generated with \usepackage 
[avantgarde]{quotchap}.

This is probably a parallel question, but how do you change the  
chapter fonts, without changing the positioning.  I've found section  
headings, etc can be modified using (for example):

\usepackage[calcwidth]{titlesec}
\titleformat{\section}[hang]{\sffamily\bfseries}{\Large\thesection} 
{12pt}{\Large}[{\titlerule[0.6pt]}]

Any suggestions?

Thanks
Suzanna

It is indeed useful.  The problem is that merely preventing hyphenation
does not fix the document, because then you get huge gaps between words
or words sticking into the margin.  It is better to relieve TeX's need
to hyphenate than to remove its ability.  Forcing flush margins onto 
large title text is silly and wrong.

I've moved on to using jurabib and bibtopic.  This seems to be a solution that

Subject: [texhax] Equivalent of CSS "collapsing margins"?
Message-ID: <20071025102922.GB8284@netsoc.tcd.ie>

Hi,

Is there any way to collapse adjoining \vspace commands? Or better yet,
to define a command, say \vspace*, which behalves like \vspace but
automatically collapse adjoining vertical spaces? For instances,

\vspace*{1em}
\vspace*{2em}

should give a total vspace of 2em. If this is not possible at all,
perhaps a poor-man's version would be a version of vspace where any
subsequent vspace commands are ignored, so that

\vspace*{1em}
\vspace*{2em}

gives a total vspace of 1em. This is not ideal, but better than nothing
:) Of course, when there is any text in between the two calls to
\vspace, the second vspace command should not be ignored. I have
searched for a solution but came up empty. Any hints would be
appreciated!

(This kind of thing is very useful when defining macros for example:
suppose one macro defines a vspace of 2em after the macro expansion, and
another defines a vspace of 1em before the macro expansion; the total
vspace should be 2em, not 3em).

Thanks!

Edsko

Sorry, don't know the LaTeX way, but TeX has the \lastskip primitive.
E.g., plain.tex defines the following macro:

  \def\bigbreak{\par\ifdim\lastskip<\bigskipamount
    \removelastskip\penalty-200\bigskip\fi}

HTH,
Oleg

I believe you'll find the macro \addvspace of interest.

Message-ID: <20071025165012.10256owfm7hnc4kk@webmail.tugraz.at>

Hello TeX-users,

I have a figure, where some symbols are inside a circle. To do that, I  
used f.e. the command:
\put(x,y){\pscirclebox[options]{I}}

Now, I would like to have the character I in the caption, also inside  
a circle! I still haven't found a way to do that. It seems that the  
caption-environment doesn't allow ps-tricks commands?

Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

Dimitris

Surely anyone who abjures the use of hyphens will also be setting ragged

I believe that it may be of interest to point out that within the  
statistics community, which
one may or may not consider to be a part of or to be closely related  
to the mathematics
community (depending on one's religion) the free system/language  
``R'' has become the
de facto standard for statistical analysis.

This has had a strong positive impact on the subject; the existence  
of R, its nature, and
its surrounding culture very definitely encourage sound statistical  
practice, to the resulting
benefit of everyone who engages in or uses statistics or depends upon  
the results of the
application of statistical techniques.

Hi,

I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly. I took it to mean that you want to use a pspicture inside a caption -- something like this will do it:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pst-all}

\newsavebox{\circIbox}
\sbox{\circIbox}{
\begin{pspicture}(0,0)(0.6,0.5)
\put(0,0){\pscirclebox{I}}
\end{pspicture}
}
\newcommand{\circI}{\usebox{\circIbox}}

\begin{document}

\section{e \circI f}

\end{document}

Dear All,

I have a LaTeX document (currently standard article class, although
this will have to change at some point,) which, when it eventually
gets submitted to a journal, will be intended to have only what's
before the \appendix{} command included in the print version of the
journal, with the material after the \appendix{} command being
electronic supplementary material.  I'd like this structure to be
reflected in the pre-submission draft versions I distribute
electronically to colleagues, i.e.~for the postscript or PDF file
generated by latex/dvips or latex/dvipdf, by default, to show
everything when viewed on-screen, but only what's before the
\appendix{} command when printed.  Any ideas, please?

If there is nothing after the appendices, you can just put
\end{document} and everything after it will be ignored.

If not, the comment package can help you.

Thanks very much, that's a good start.  However, it's not quite what
I'm looking for.  Either of the options you suggest would give me the
option, by a small edit of the LaTeX file, of either including the
relevant material in the DVI file as normal or not including it at
all.  What I'd really like is to include the relevant material in the
DVI file (and thence in a postscript or PDF file,) but with an
instruction that it should be handled differently, depending whether
the document is being viewed on screen or printed.  For example, one
possibility that looks promising on a glance at the PDF Reference
<http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf>
(p. 581) would be setting the PrintPageRange key in the PDF file.  Is
there a LaTeX package that does something like this?

[Stop press: formulate the question right and Google will answer.  I
think the pdfprintpagerange option of the hyperref package might do
what I need.]

Has anyone else been clobbered by the discovery that Adobe Acrobat 8 
tacitly suppresses all ligature glyphs of the fi, fl, ff, ffi, and ffl 
sort and displays blanks in their place.  They do this without warning, 
so that a file which displays perfectly well in Acrobat 7 is made 
unreadable in Acrobat 8. 

I do not see any justification for this arbitrary arrogance.   It is 
probably necessary to degrade the appearance of fonts this way in XML, 
which explicitly abjures any aesthetic concerns, but there is absolutely 
no excuse for it in PDF that is sent out for display only. 

After a happy interlude when some of the horrors of the 70s and 80s were 
left behind us, we are being forced back into the procrustean world of 
the ITC, with its exaggerated x-heights and stubby ascenders.  In time 
we will be required to abandon everything but generic serif 
(Souvenir---nice short ascenders) and generic sans-serif (Helvetica or 
one of its clones).   That is where content-only protocols must 
eventually lead. 

I do not see, however, why PDF, which was able until 2006 to display 
quality fonts with ligatures, should be subject to this sort of 
degradation.  If there is one thing that PDF most definitely is not, it 
is a content-based protocol.

Note that you set only the initial value in the print dialog.

One possiblity seems to use OCGs and View/Print (p. 351) or use
annotations. Images can have alternate images (p. 317).

It doesn't here (AR8 at Linux). sample2e shows e.g. an ff ligature.

I have the same problem with the Multiple Master font Minion
and the ff and ffi ligatures, when converting the document with
GhostScript. With the Distiller it is ok. Adobe was not able to find
the problem ...

That is good news, in a way.  It still remains that files which display 
correctly in Adobe 7 have become useless in
Adobe 8.  Adobe 8 has clearly made some hidden changes.  But I guess the 
Ghostscript people will have to find out what those are. 

I shall now try the on-line Distiller provided by Adobe, and see how 
that works.

Message-ID: <cb1612d0710271155x371c5540r3a3be285ee26c342@mail.gmail.com>

Hello folks, it's a long time since I've been involved in the TeX
world, and I'ld like to say I'm back, but I'm just dropping in for a
short visit.

Every now and then I wish I could do my web sites in TeX (and more
frequently, set a little maths in a web page) and I check to see if
there is an implementation of TeX in existence which generates plain
HTML web pages - i.e no plugin required, and not simply embedding a
large graphic image of a pahe in HTML.

Unless I've missed it, there is no such version of TeX and TeX still
hasn't taken over the web world - which it should have done years ago!

Well, last night I asked myself why not...  HTML now has absolute
positioning, which is what was missing from HTML years back when we
first said that TeX was not a good fit for the web.  So over about 3
hourslast night I hacked up a proof-of-concept dvi driver to generate
HTML using absolutely positioned <DIV> tags.  Apart from the obvious
problems (I.e. I haven't done any font metric work at all so
positioning is just approximate in the P.o.C), it clearly shows that
this is possible!

Have a look at the Proof of Concept output and source code:

 http://www.gtoal.com/src/dvi2html/testdoc.html
    (teTeX is not involved in this technology, it's just a test
document I picked at random)

 http://www.gtoal.com/src/dvi2html/dvi2html.c.html

- short, easy to hack up as a demo... I'm very confdent that someone
who is current in TeX (and especially is knowlegable about using fonts
other than the standard TeX-supplied ones) could build a real driver
in a similar style in about a week.  I suspect it could have a lot in
common with pdfTeX?

The most effective way would be to generate the DVI using the fonts
and font metrics of the standard (Win & Mac) HTML fonts (
http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html ).  A less
well targetted way would be to map arbitrary fonts to that set, which
would let you use existing dvi files.  (This would be similar to the
Type & Set system Graham Asher wrote some years ago).  A third option
would be to have a central server with graphic images of the TeX
characters (to avoid the need to download fonts, allowing the pages to
be viewed in the correct fonts by anyone - this is not a good choice
though, I prefer the first option).  A fourth option may be to
download the fonts in the HTML page itself (which I think is possible
but I've never done it myself and don't know how it's done).

Anyway, here's my challenge to the TeX developer community.  Create a
version of TeX that generates HTML as per the demo above.  As well as
a stand-alone version, implement it as a filter which can be inserted
into an apache web server to render .dvi files directly, and also, if
it is possible, to render .tex files directly (via a pipeline
involving dvi).  The advantage of the latter is that you can reformat
pages on the fly using the page size from the browser, so that you get
things like balanced columns done properly on screen.  (There's some
issues with page size and printing from HTML pages; it can be done but
needs some thought. It may be easier to just link to a pdf if you want
to print a tex-generated HTML page)

I hope someone finds the demo inspiring enough to give this a try.  I
don't have the time to take on a project like this myself right now,
and I'm 15 years out of touch with TeX internals.  I'm not the guy to
do this, but I hope someone here is!  Take it away, guys...

Possibly, but I don't see a single page there that looks like HTML
output from TeX!  I'd be more convinced if their web site was
obviously formatted with TeX.  The only way I could find out if that
is what I'm hoping exists would be to download it, build it, and try
it out :-(  I'ld be delighted if what I suggest does already exist
somewhere.

Sebastian, how do you write math formulas?  Directly in XML?  Or do
you use a dedicated formula editor?  I understand that people want to
enter formulas in tex syntax because this is most straightforward.

As far as I know, tex4ht can also create XML, but I fear that formulas
are provided as bitmaps.  This is probably not as bad as it sounds
because it avoids problems with fonts which are not installed
everywhere.

How do you solve the font problem in XML?  A reasonable solution would
be to provide them as SVG fonts.  But are they understood by most web
browsers we have today?  I'm not very optimistic but you certainly can
tell us more.

BTW, at the TUG-2006 conference in Marrakech Adrian Frischauf
demonstrated his program dvi2svg and I had been quite impressed.
Fonts had been provided as SVG.  Adrian used a program written by
Michel Goossens which converts Type1 fonts to SVG.  The SVG file
contained all the resources needed, and what impressed me most was to
see perfectly typeset math formulas and text in Computer Modern in a
web browser.  Anyway, I suppose that most web browsers do not support
SVG properly yet.

Graham, IMO HTML is not a good choice if you want to provide math
formulas.  If you insist on HTML or XML it makes sense to provide the
same stuff as PDF as well.  People who prefer a printed copy will be
grateful for this.  And even if I don't, it looks awful.

Your example file 

    http://www.gtoal.com/src/dvi2html/testdoc.html

doesn't work properly here.  The problem is that you are using
absolute coordinates but Firefox allows me to change the size of the
font I'm currently using.  When I increase font size, strings
overlap.

Why do prefer HTML?  Why don't you provide PDF?  Unlike HTML, PDF is
portable.  And you can have hyperlinks to other PDF files, too.  A
good example is the hyperref documentation:

 http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/hyperref.pdf

Regards,
  Reinhard

Unless there's more to the system than that example page shows, it's
definitely not what I'm looking for.  It looks like it just outputs
fairly simple running HTML (not page-based) and it appears to allows
the browser to break the lines.

What I want is this:imagine you're using pdfTeX, and your browser has
the pdf viewer plugin installed so that pdf pages are displayed
embedded in the web browser rather than in an external helper app like
Acrobat Reader.  Then imagine this embedded pdf file as showing just
the document without any of the messy framing and unnecessary clutter
that the pdf plugins have.

Now, instead of a pdf plugin, imagine it was implemented by a DVI
plugin.  Great, except that as far as I'm aware, no-one in the last 10
years has written one, and even if they have, unless it came
pre-installed with most browsers, it wouldn't encourage people to
write arbitrary web sites using TeX because people would have to
install a plugin when they visited the site.  Goodbye 99% of your
visitors.

So... now imagine the look of this hypothetical DVI plugin, but
implemented using standard HTML primitives.  I.e. a TeX previewer
implemented in HTML.

That's what I'm suggesting.  Allowing us to use TeX to make web pages
that look really nice. (Have you ever tried doing decent multi-column
stuff in HTML for example???)

The first iteration would have you generate pages statically from TeX,
very much like embedding PDF files in a web page.  But the potential
is for the next iteration to display .tex files live on the fly, with
the TeX process being fed the X and Y size of the page from the
browser.  This would let you format pages to the screen size, which
again, for multi-column work, would be pretty desirable I'ld have
thought.

So if we have a version of TeX which uses the portable set of HTML
fonts, I think that what I'm suggesting is quite doable.  It may be
too late for something that I wished we'd had 10 years ago when the
web first started, but I'ld still like to see it anyway.  I'ld
certainly use it :-)

Hi Graham,

    Possibly, but I don't see a single page there that looks like HTML
    output from TeX!

Indeed, I'm sure Eitan (Gurari, the author of tex4ht) did not make his
web pages in TeX, and sees no reason to do so.  That was never his main
goal with tex4ht.  But I see no reason it can't be used to do it.

For an example, http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/live.html is the
TeX Live document, written as a LaTeX document and processed with
tex4ht.

tex4ht is included in TeX Live.  If you want to play with tex4ht, I
recommend installing TeX Live, instead of trying to do it from the
original sources.

There are other tex-to-html converters, but I am a bit doubtful that ny
of the others are flexible enough for the job you are envisioning.
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=LaTeX2HTML

tex4ht is amazingly flexible/configurable, but beware, documentation is
sparse.  Here is an intro article by Eitan:
http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb25-1/gurari.pdf

Whenever I run into trouble with tex4ht, I end up mailing Eitan :(.

Best,
Karl

I don't ever write math, and don't see much likelihood

depends what you mean by the "font problem".
the sort of stuff I do is catered for by Unicode,
I am afraid.

But I agree, if I had to do it, I'd be looking at SVG.

I don't know, I was hoping that someone with more HTML experience than
me would know some tricks for making pages scalable, maybe with some
client-side javascript to alter the absolute positions in the DOM?  As
I said, I was offering a proof of concept, not a complete
implementation.  So I guess you're saying that scaling a page is not a
supported feature of HTML yet? Oh well, at least we can now position
things absolutely.  Maybe in another 10 years...  Baby steps...

I guess if it can't be done browser-side it would have to be done at
the server.  Can the browser be made to tell the server what
magnification the user has selected? (maybe with some AJAX hack)  From
the viewpoint of a DVI previewer that should just be like applying a
magstep.

Tell you what, we're digressing into HTML issues here and away from
TeX, probably best to wind up this thread on TeXhax before we stray
too far off topic.  Feel free to follow up by direct email.

It was good to hear from you all again.  Looks like all the usual
suspects are still in the frame.

Hi Graham

I agree that this sounds nice but personally I barely notice the
extras from the pdf viewer.

The more specific idea of using HTML to describe fixed format material
is simply not fashionable.

Moreover, there are good reasons for allowing a certain amount of
user-control over the appearance of information to be displayed on
screens: differently-sized screens (inludinng these days moblie
devices: yes I have seen TeX-typeset maths displayed on a phone!,
different user requirements for text size and colour, ...).

Of course it would be good to have a system in which Sebastian can
happily write his XML (by hand:-) which is then (for those who would
like it that way) processed by a document formatter, with far better
aesthetic standards than TeX, into XHTML that is of the highest quality
and provides the correct amounts of author/editor- vs reader- control. 

But that requires, inter alia, making TeX-like processing available in
software that concurrently manipulates the objects in a DOM-like
structure.  [BTW: Such software would also produce far superior (to
any variant of the TeX paradigm) results for paper-style publication.]

Cheers,  chris

Yes, and our (younger:-) students need to be able to chat about Maths
and other specialised stuff via Facebook and its ilk: so restricting
Web2.0 etc to information in Unicode-encoded natural language is very
limiting and trivialises the wholeeffort.

So why not Manage some highly structured, highly meaningful and
somewhat more useful Information, at least occasionally?  Now that
would be a Service to Oxford students studying sensible subjects.

Just one simple example (for a novel):

  you could produce concurrently, for each paragraph in a chapter, a
  range of 'good enough' formattings; these collections can then be
  used to choose the optimal pagination (lengths plus breaks) for the
  chapter (possibly, but probably not, by global optimisation).

That one (I think) is more fully explained in Mittelbach & Rowley
[1992a] but I am sure you can generalise.

General manipulation of the whole document tree must be be more
productive than mutliple sequential runs over it, must it not?

Have you seen jsMath: <http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/> (as
used for the SAGE notebook)?

Some quotes from the above site:

"The jsMath package provides a method of including mathematics in HTML
pages that works across multiple browsers under Windows, Macintosh OS
X, Linux and other flavors of unix. It overcomes a number of the
shortcomings of the traditional method of using images to represent
mathematics: jsMath uses native fonts, so they resize when you change
the size of the text in your browser, they print at the full
resolution of your printer, and you don't have to wait for dozens of
images to be downloaded in order to see the mathematics in a web page.
There are also advantages for web-page authors, as there is no need to
preprocess your web pages to generate any images, and the mathematics
is entered in TeX form, so it is easy to create and maintain your web
pages."

"JsMath is a collection of JavaScript programs that make it possible
to display mathematics within web pages. It works across multiple
browsers and hardware platforms, without the need for additional
downloads or plugins on the part of the user. (It helps, however, if
the user installs a set of math fonts, but that is not required.)
Unlike methods that represent mathematics using images, the equations
generated by jsMath will be correctly sized in relation to the
surrounding text, regardless of the font size set by the user, and can
even resize properly if the user changes the font size on the fly. If
the math fonts are installed, the equations will print at the full
resolution of the printer, and if not, the user can request a
hi-resolution version of the page for printing purposes."

No, I had been using this:
http://test.izyba.com/equationeditor/equationeditor.php- but the link
above is much nicer!  Good find, thanks.

I'm trying to work out how they did it!  It looks like actual TeX
source embedded in the HTML file.  Must be some real clever trickery
in the style sheet to extract it and send it to a cgi for rendering...
Wow - no, they're not passing it to TeX on the fly - it looks like
they're written a complete maths layout package in javascript that
duplicates what TeX does.  I'm impressed!  I will probably use this
for embedding equations in web pages, but it's still not what I'm
looking for to lay out complete web pages.

What subjects require specialized typesetting other than linguistics &
math?  Unicode plain text has support for almost anything linguists
need, and  TeX-like math can be encoded as per

That is only Murray's ideas about a possible extension of Donald
Knuth's paradigm of 'simple maths as he claims to speak it'.

It is highly recommended reading for anyone interested in the input
and processing of Unicode-based maths but it is, like TeX, somewhat
isiosyncratic and equally complex.

But we are being asked voluably to continue to support LaTeX as a
language for maths in computers so it is possible that something
like this will be taken up as Yet Another Ad Hoc Standard.

It would be very interesting to know if there are yet a communities
communicating via Unicode-maths of any type?

Thanks for bringing this work to the attention of a Texie audience.


chris

PS: My understanding from Murray is that he would expect such input to
be converted to MathML in XHTML for browser use when this becmes more
practical and widespread.

There are plenty of places where today's computing power should
be able to cope, on the fly, with appropriate processing of data
that has been entered in an encoded format.

e.g.,  chemical structure diagrams, feynman graphs,
musical notation, commutative diagrams, tree diagrams, etc.
Doubtless many others too in non-academic pursuits:
e.g., film-score scripts, dance-step notation, recipes,
chess notation, crosswords, SuDoKu games, bell-ringing,
sewing/knitting instructions, ...

By all means, Unicode can provide the transportation mechanism,
but authors cannot be expected to have to compose directly in it.


The input method should be whatever is most appropriate
for a person to express his/her ideas reliably.

Similarly, the final viewable output should be what is most
appropriate for a person to view that kind of data, on the
particular device being used.

Processors (via plug-ins) sit between the human interfaces
at either end, either generating or decoding Unicode strings,
for the greatest level of compatibilty and reliability of
the electronic transportation.

What I mean is that not all fonts can be expected to be installed
everywhere.  Unicode is nice, but you still need the "real" fonts.

If you don't need math fonts, there is no problem.  Many system fonts
provide glyphs for many languages.  But math fonts are still
problematic.

Do you (or someone else) know whether SVG fonts are supported by
current web browsers?

I tried the jsMath examples.  Though absolute coordinates are
transformed when I increase the font size, math symbols and greek
glyphs are provided as bitmaps if the fonts are not available.  Maybe
SVG fonts would be a solution.

    As far as I know, tex4ht can also create XML, 

Yes.

    but I fear that formulas are provided as bitmaps.  

It can render to bitmaps, or to MathML, or use Unicode chars for
"simple" math (say just $\alpha$), or some mixture.  Eitan has really
built a lot into it.

    The SVG file contained all the resources needed,

At least at the time Michel wrote his article, SVG did not support
kerns/ligatures.  Which doesn't matter much for a few diagram labels,
but any kind of running text is another matter.

Don't forget music notation (LilyPond, based on MusiXTeX)! - And
according to my experience typesetting using (La)TeX provides results
that are essentially better than others also in "simple" text
environments such as Arabic-Latin bilingual texts, where ArabTeX is a
superior tool.

That's OK, I'm happy for someone reading the document to override my

?for which I received a list of corrections.

I meant to restrict my claim to "text-like", rather than graphical,
subjects.  Chemical formulae can be handled by almost any system that
can handle mathematics; diagrams obviously require more.  The diagrams
that linguists may use again need some graphical presentation, but the
symbols referred to can (or should be able to) be accessed directly
from Unicode text.

Music, on the other hand, *seems* as if it should be easily expressed
in text form, but consider how complicated the LilyPond sheet music
source code is for a piece of classical music.

So I guess I have to withdraw my claim.

It is not quite so simple for dynamical and structural formulae: try
writing a ChemML to TeX translator to find out why.

Looking at it another way: built-up fractions, banded matrices, limits
etc are diagramatic representations that have been stylised and become
almost text.

A better distinction would be between 1.5 dimensional stuff and truly
2-(or more)-dimensional stuff.

That is precisely what they(he, in fact) claim to have done, plus an
interpreter for quite a bit (and growing) of non-primitive LaTeX.  But
it only produces a bitmapped image of the whole of each bit of maths
emebedded in the HTML, not the actual maths.

There are now many web-related systems that process more or less
LaTeX-like input without using any of TeX's many engines to do it.

Wow! I'm impressed too.

One obvious improvement that could be made here would be to use svg  
instead of bitmaps --- convert the glyphs to paths to work around the  
current inability of browsers to access fonts embedded in an svg and  
one would have a nice, resolution-independent ability to print / zoom  
in.

Although I have little (?no?) hope of HTML 5 ever
becoming a reality (probably a Good Thing [tm], IMHO,
given the current apparently /ad hoc/ criteria by
which features have been carried forward, dropped,
or introduced  /ex nihilo/), I do wonder whether its
putative <canvas> element might provide a suitable
basis  for the display of page-description languages
such as DVI ...

Why not MathML for the maths?  ... !!

But I agree that SVG should take over the world for really useful
visuals on the web; at one stage it had quite a rich text model,
soemewhat like PDFs but that got dropped and it is now too simple for
serious textual stuff.

Does SVG support hints?  I don't know anything about SVG, but Adrian
presented the output of dvi2svg in Marrakech.  The SVG file looked
quite straightforward but I didn't see any hints in it.  Don't know
whether the SVG standard supports them or they are simply not
implemented in dvi2svg.  A glyph without hints is a simple vector
graphic.  Hence, William's suggestion is very reasonable.

IMO hints are important, though at reasonable high resolutions
antialiasing improves the situation a bit.  At low resolutions
antialiasing doesn't help.  If you need ultimate quality you have to
use pdftex and have to activate the microtypographic extensions.  On
the other hand, the output of dvi2svg looked beautiful, though.  Maybe
I'll change my mind if someone gives me some more files for testing.

The only disadvantage of William's suggestion is that it is probably
less efficient than using a font.  But in jsMath only the math symbols
and Greek characters are missing.  Converting glyphs to paths is much
better than providing bitmaps.  Yes, it's a good idea indeed.

Regards,
  Reinhard

Kerning pairs in Type1 fonts are described in AFM files and probably
the AFM stuff is not supported by Michel's program.  But it doesn't
matter at all.  dvi2svg derives kerning information from the DVI file.

I also think that ligatures are not a problem.  A ligature is simply a
glyph.  The problem is to find out when to replace "ff" by an
"ff-ligature".  But a DVI file already contains this information.

But that makes no difference to how the glyphs are rendered.

But if the comma were the wrong separator,

/did/ work, then it would be much faster
to ask here than to try all possible

It actually does.  Of course, glyphs are rendered differently if you
activate pdftex's microtypographic extensions.

I assume that you are using LaTeX.  So please take an arbitrary
document and compile it again.  Count the number of hyphenations and
overfull hboxes.

Then insert the line

  \usepackage{microtype}

and try again.

There will be less hyphenations and less overful hboxes but fonts will
be rendered differently.  Try the program pdffonts.  If you don't have
it, try File->Document Properties->Fonts in Adobe Reader.

Regards,
  Reinhard

It'd be different if Mozilla weren't at a prototype stage, and IE's  
support was ``working on a technology''. I'm impressed w/ jsmath, and  
I see it as a useful work-around until all the major browsers get  
mathml support (at which time I hope it can be adapted to seamlessly

Anti-aliasing makes hinting much less important, and an anti-aliased  
svg on-screen should look as good as the anti-aliased bitmap now  
being used, but will print _much_ better.

That is due to diffrent psoitioning of glyphs, not the rendering (ie
turning into pixels) of individual glyphs. 

Apologies for not explaining my vocabulary.

Chris, you really should know better.
Microtypography changes the shape of glyphs by stretching or
compressing them. It's explained in the pdftex manual, btw.

Good, and thanks for the information and assessment.  So now all we
need is integrated SVG and MathML in all our favourite browsers:-(.

I am sooo sorry Martin: I should have added 'choice of glyph' too:
that is still not 'rendering of the glyphs' in the sense that William
is writing.

Why not build it now?

You seem to know how.  If utterly beautiful typeset pages were to

Last week someone posted a query about Adobe Reader, v. 8, saying that it 
did not render ligatures correctly (or at all) on files created by tex.  I 
don't recall if it was files converted by dvipdfm or from pdf{tex,latex}.  
I have not tested the latter, but I have no problem whatever with files 
converted by dvipdfm.  To be precise, I am using version 8.1.1, which is 
what they are currently distributing.  In any case, there are a number of 
free pdf renderers.

I'm typesetting a book about the JavaScript library script.aculo.us.  
As you might imagine, the name occurs frequently, often at the end of  
the line, but TeX won't hyphenate it. I can't suggest anything to TeX  
globally via \hyphenation, since the name contains periods. Are there  
any known work-arounds to this? I would hate to have to enter \- by  
hand hundreds of times. (No, I can't change the name, and I'm not the  
author of the book, so I can't reduce the number of times it is  
mentioned.)

Thanks!

1) As it occurs "hundreds of times", you must already
be representing it within your document using a control
word.  Re-define the control word as follows :

     \def \sau {script.\-aculo.\-us}

Example :

     \hsize = 1 in
     \raggedright
     \def \sau {script.\-aculo.\-us}
     {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau}
     {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau}
     {\sau} {\sau} {\sau} {\sau}

As I said, I am the typesetter, not the author, so that approach

This addresses only part of the problem.  The other part is the question 
of archival stability, which used, at least,
to be one of the chief concerns of the TeX world. 

What has happened is that a large archive of DOI documents, that 
happened to be distilled using Ghostscript, and that displayed perfectly 
in Adobe 6 and Adobe 7, has now been made worthless.  My own solution 
FOR THE FUTURE, is to make use of Adobe's createpdf service, because 
only then am I guaranteed to remain in step with new and potentially 
imcompatible "upgrades" of PDF, but the loss of years of archived PDF 
documents is not trivial.  I learn that with the
diagnostics of Adobe Reader 8, the missing ligatures can be discovered 
as "hidden text".  Why is it "hidden" in Reader 8 when it was visible in 
Reader 7.

Hi list,

This is a weird problem. I use the following for my thesis to force
me to include a date with each link I refer to, or make it explicit
that I don't need a date, e.g. \link{http://debian.org}{}:

  % not making #2 optional on purpose
  \renewcommand{\link}[2] {%
  \burl{#1}%
  \if\@empty#2\relax\else{ }\begin{smaller}{[#2]}\end{smaller}\fi%
  }

The problem is that this works fine for dates like 1 Oct 2007 or 15
Sep 2007, but as soon as the date is 11 or 22, something goes fishy:

While \link{http://debian.org/Bugs/server-control}{10 Oct 2007}}
yields:

  http://debian.org/Bugs/server-control [10 Oct 2007]

\link{http://debian.org/Bugs/server-control}{11 Oct 2007}} gets me

  http://debian.org/Bugs/server-control Oct 2007

Either TeX is on drugs, or I am, or I simply don't understand what's
going on. Could you help me figure this out, please?

I failed to point out that putting the second #2 in braces like
this: {[{#2}]} makes it work.

Your test for empty arguments is broken.

This is true, but search and replace is deterministic. I'm aware of 
gotcha's with it, but I have (successfully) done global S&R on 
books/theses I  typeset to allow just such tweaks. 

For example I used macros to express context sensitive diacritics  
where the author used a fixed string in all contexts but wanted to 
see the diacritics vary according to which aspect of the dictionary 
entry they appeared in: - name, definition, etymology, source etc.  

For that book, I found it hard to construct the context sensitive 
macros, but the conversion of the source text did not create 
problems. And Phil has kindly written the macro for you. So I believe 
you have a good solution.

> Your test for empty arguments is broken.

Hello, thanks for your reply! Your proposed solution does in fact
work. Thank you very much.

Now I would like to understand what's going on. And I have two
questions:

1. Why do you postpone the command creation until \makeatletter? It
works just fine if I define it in the preamble with \newcommand.

2. I still don't understand the problem I had. It seems that my test
somehow ate arguments.

Let's look at the three kinds of invocation:

\link{http://debian.org/}{} would print
  http://debian.org/
which is correct.

\link{http://debian.org/}{10 Oct 2007} would print
  http://debian.org/ [10 Oct 2007]
with the date in brackets at a smaller font size. Also correct.

\link{http://debian.org/}{11 Oct 2007} would print
  http://debian.org/ Oct 2007
with the date at the same size as the link. This is wrong.

My function did

  \if\@empty#2\relax\else{ }\begin{smaller}{[#2]}\end{smaller}\fi%

but nothing about the test for empty arguments I use explains that
behaviour, and especially not that it works as soon as I use two
extra braces:

  \if\@empty#2\relax\else{ }\begin{smaller}{[{#2}]}\end{smaller}\fi%

It seems as if the function gets "11 Oct 2007" as #2 and then ends
up comparing the first two members (1 & 1). If they are equal, then
it would push back the rest of #2 and exit, such that the remainder,
"Oct 2007" would be printed outside the function (and outside
\begin{smaller}). This just blows my mind. Do you have an idea what
exactly is happening?

You could report it to one of the MiKTeX lists but then I am fairly
sure they'd ask you to install v2.6 as v2.5 is obsolete.

Dear Martin,

Quoting martin f krafft (madduck at madduck.net):
> 1. Why do you postpone the command creation until \makeatletter? It
> works just fine if I define it in the preamble with \newcommand.

\makeatletter just allows the usage of @ as part of a command name.
This already is true inside package files (style files). I'm surprised it
is true in the preamble aswell, though that might be just me. (I just
always use \makeatletter when I need such a command, so I usually need not
remember whether it would work without this command...)

I leave the rest of your questions to those more skilled at TeX than me...

Hope that helps,

	Susan

Martin's solution as well as your original code makes use of a command
with @ in it, requiring @ to be a letter at the time of definition.
See <http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=atsigns> for
details.

\if does compare tokens but first expands them. Hence \@empty is
expanded (to nothing) and then the next two tokens are compared. If
the date is the 10th, 1 and 0 are compared. If the date is the 11th, 1
and 1 are compared.

The source where you learned about using \if ought to be clear on
this, be it a book or a TeX hacker.

In general, use dedicated functions for these things. I use
\tlist_if_empty:nTF and \tlist_if_blank:nTF from the expl3 code, where
the names should indicate what they test for (tlist = token list).

Cheers,

Well, this is starting to make sense. So in the case of the 11th,
1 and 1 are compared and found to be equal, which means that the
remainder of #2 is printed before the \relax:

  Oct 2007\relax

I am sure I just hacked this up from looking at .sty and .cls files.
It's not like I know of a good TeX reference that goes into these
levels of detail. TeX to me is still black magic.

It's not. I define the command in a .sty file I then incorporate
with \usepackage.

When I was trying to redefine the way description items are
rendered in the preamble, I had to make use of \makeatletter:

  \makeatletter
  \renewcommand{\descriptionlabel}[1]%
    {\hspace{\labelsep}\descfont{#1}\normalfont~?}
  \makeatother

I suppose this was because something somehwere made use of an @ sign.

Has anyone filed a bug report with Adobe? Their Linux AR folks at:

   http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bc433df/

are usally pretty responsive when issues are pointed out to them. 

Now I notice that in the test-gs example that Herbert posted:

   http://perce.de/temp/test-gs.pdf 

the text displays properly with AR7.0.9 but it does not
cut-n-paste properly. Therefore I suspect the problem
might have to do with the UTF encoding. 

Cheers,

James

the encoding is not imortant here.
I can show the same with latin1.

Pierre means that I have been in touch with an Adobe QC engineer, who
will submit a bug this morning on the topic.  Who knows what happens
then, but I'll let you all know.

My contact had a further question, assuming that whoever is responsible
can be persuaded it's a bug.  In his own capacity as a guy who sets up
tests that Adobe software has to pass, he wondered whether a few short
documents could be generated with which to test future versions of the
Reader.  If anyone would like to send me such documents -- single page
files that contain ligatures and any other special font features you can
think of, and where failure to display them is obvious -- he might be
able to add them to the test suite.

Sorry I didn't see this post before I sent mine.

I have a number of test documents that show problems with AR8's
interactive features. For example: 

http://www.amrita-cfd.org/4adobe/media-player/test1.pdf

shows a peculiarity that causes Linux/AR to exit without warning
(just hit the play button twice) and: 

http://www.amrita-ebook.org/4adobe/doc-ordering/jjq-test1.pdf
http://www.amrita-ebook.org/4adobe/doc-ordering/jjq-test2.pdf

show there's a problem with document-ordering when dealing
with embedded PDF's in fullscreen mode. 

I understand that these tests do not cover font issues, 
but if your contact is interested in beefing up AR's tests
across the board then I would be more than happy to supply
some stress tests.
